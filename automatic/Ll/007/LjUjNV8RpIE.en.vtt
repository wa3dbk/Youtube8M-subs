00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
was before okay and now how are your

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.920 
was before okay and now how are your
realistic<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> chances<00:02:55.450> are

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
realistic do you think the chances are

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.870 
realistic do you think the chances are
that<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.260> end<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.010> season<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.640> before

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
that you end the season here before

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.520 
that you end the season here before
playoffs<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.450> top<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.870> table<00:02:59.020> what<00:02:59.470> do

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
playoffs at the top of the table what do

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.570 
playoffs at the top of the table what do
you<00:02:59.590> think<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.950> teams<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.370> trailing

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
you think of the teams that are trailing

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.920 
you think of the teams that are trailing
behind<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.330> behind<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
behind you just behind you in the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.670 
behind you just behind you in the
standings<00:03:02.290> right<00:03:02.350> now<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:04.110> think<00:03:05.110> it's<00:03:05.530> going

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
standings right now I think it's going

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.460 
standings right now I think it's going
to<00:03:05.770> be<00:03:05.920> really<00:03:06.430> close<00:03:07.330> stats<00:03:07.750> at<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.260> end<00:03:08.350> of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
to be really close stats at the end of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.930 
to be really close stats at the end of
the<00:03:08.620> season<00:03:08.770> like<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> see<00:03:11.590> us<00:03:12.070> as<00:03:12.670> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the season like but I see us as the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.300 
the season like but I see us as the
first<00:03:13.450> place<00:03:13.750> maybe<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:14.500> magic<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.130> get

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
first place maybe if magic will get

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.870 
first place maybe if magic will get
close<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.790> us<00:03:15.940> as<00:03:16.180> sk<00:03:16.900> or<00:03:17.370> even<00:03:18.370> guys<00:03:18.580> from

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
close to us as sk or even guys from

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.530 
close to us as sk or even guys from
Poland<00:03:19.239> will<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.690> as<00:03:19.870> well<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.700> don't<00:03:22.150> I
