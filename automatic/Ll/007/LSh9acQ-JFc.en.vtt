forward drives coming out as autos what
are<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> advantages<00:00:14.219> between<00:00:14.700> autos<00:00:15.089> and

are the advantages between autos and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
top I'm revved up I've got to get it in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
top I'm revved up I've got to get it in
the<00:00:51.149> third<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.899> you've<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.289> really

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the third now you've got to be really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
the third now you've got to be really
quick<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.460> third<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.030> going

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
quick to get into third or you're going

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
quick to get into third or you're going
to<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.329> down<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> people<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.160> have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to go down a lot of people that have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
to go down a lot of people that have
tried<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:57.149> failed<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.620> with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tried that have failed to do it but with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.049 
tried that have failed to do it but with
an<00:00:58.859> automatic<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> constant

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
an automatic you have a constant

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
an automatic you have a constant
drivetrain<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.780> constant<00:01:01.260> power<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
drivetrain you have constant power so it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
drivetrain you have constant power so it
is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.579> easier<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.570> automatic<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
is a lot easier with an automatic to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
is a lot easier with an automatic to
mean<00:01:04.860> manual<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mean manual is a different way to do

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.600 
mean manual is a different way to do
things<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> personal<00:01:08.280> taste

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
things it's a bit of a personal taste

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
things it's a bit of a personal taste
it's<00:01:09.150> got<00:01:09.390> its<00:01:09.540> benefits<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.439> got

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's got its benefits where it's got

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's got its benefits where it's got
direct<00:01:10.950> power<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.430> foot<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> you've<00:01:11.970> got

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
direct power to your foot and you've got

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
direct power to your foot and you've got
a<00:01:12.119> lot<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.330> control<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.020> clutch<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a lot more control with your clutch and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
a lot more control with your clutch and
everything<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.860> example<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.520> prefer<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> when

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
everything for example I prefer it when

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
everything for example I prefer it when
I'm<00:01:15.780> rock<00:01:15.990> crawling<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> big

I'm rock crawling in things to the big
v8<00:01:17.369> automatics<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.270> find<00:01:18.509> I've<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
v8 automatics I find I've just got that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
v8 automatics I find I've just got that
little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.830> control<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.490> bit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
little bit more control a little bit

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.719 
little bit more control a little bit
more<00:01:20.880> torque<00:01:21.210> down<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> bottom<00:01:22.400> once<00:01:23.400> again

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
more torque down the bottom once again

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
more torque down the bottom once again
it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> matter<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> comfort<00:01:24.630> knees<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> what

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it's a matter of comfort knees and what

these days with modern automatics
I<00:02:17.400> honestly<00:02:17.910> think<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.569> had<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> choice<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
I honestly think if I had a choice and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720 
I honestly think if I had a choice and
had<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.470> cart<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.220> way<00:02:20.340> I'd<00:02:20.490> go

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
had one cart that's the way I'd go

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.050 
had one cart that's the way I'd go
because<00:02:21.090> they're<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.690> easy
