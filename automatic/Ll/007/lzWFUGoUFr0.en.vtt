kind<00:00:35.080> of<00:00:35.140> on<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.379> cusp<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.910> modern<00:00:37.750> era

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
kind of on the cusp of the modern era

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.630 
kind of on the cusp of the modern era
the<00:00:38.470> same<00:00:38.650> time<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:39.010> sort<00:00:39.250> of<00:00:39.280> have<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:39.580> like

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
the same time you sort of have this like

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.939 
the same time you sort of have this like
lingering<00:00:40.210> sense<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.960> mysticism<00:00:41.350> we

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
lingering sense of mysticism we

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.400 
lingering sense of mysticism we
definitely<00:00:42.790> drew<00:00:43.480> from<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.809> lot<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.199> stuff

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
definitely drew from a lot of that stuff

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.470 
definitely drew from a lot of that stuff
I<00:00:44.650> remember<00:00:45.219> being<00:00:45.520> enamored<00:00:45.910> with<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.329> whole

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
I remember being enamored with the whole

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.720 
I remember being enamored with the whole
idea<00:00:46.899> of<00:00:47.140> Camelot<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.430> knights<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
idea of Camelot and the knights of the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.340 
idea of Camelot and the knights of the
round<00:00:48.820> table<00:00:49.030> something<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:49.960> was<00:00:50.079> not

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
round table something that was not

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.869 
round table something that was not
religious<00:00:50.829> but<00:00:50.860> really<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.430> know<00:00:51.550> about

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
religious but really you know about

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.549 
religious but really you know about
humanity<00:00:52.390> if<00:00:52.539> you<00:00:52.660> look<00:00:52.809> at<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:52.989> Arthurian

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
humanity if you look at the Arthurian

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.799 
humanity if you look at the Arthurian
legend<00:00:53.890> there's<00:00:54.340> something<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.760> go<00:00:55.180> back<00:00:55.450> to

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
legend there's something that go back to

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.170 
legend there's something that go back to
pre-roman<00:00:56.379> Celtic<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.430> we<00:00:57.520> wanted<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.059> get

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
pre-roman Celtic and we wanted to get

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.060 
pre-roman Celtic and we wanted to get
that<00:00:58.390> kind<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.660> Celtic<00:00:59.020> lineage<00:00:59.350> back<00:00:59.590> into

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
that kind of Celtic lineage back into

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.520 
that kind of Celtic lineage back into
the<00:01:00.670> oldest<00:01:01.090> part<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.629> order<00:01:01.809> it's<00:01:02.289> so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
the oldest part of the order it's so

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.100 
the oldest part of the order it's so
rich<00:01:02.860> with<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.489> law<00:01:03.670> with<00:01:04.180> those<00:01:04.449> interaction

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
rich with the law with those interaction

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.840 
rich with the law with those interaction
and<00:01:05.229> people<00:01:05.619> these<00:01:05.800> noble<00:01:06.190> knights<00:01:06.430> basically

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
and people these noble knights basically

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.520 
and people these noble knights basically
protecting<00:01:07.300> humanity<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.289> was<00:01:08.380> like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
protecting humanity and and it was like

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.639 
protecting humanity and and it was like
well<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.880> could<00:01:10.119> meld<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.810> story<00:01:11.410> like<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
well if we could meld a story like that

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.680 
well if we could meld a story like that
if<00:01:12.340> we<00:01:12.580> build<00:01:12.820> those<00:01:13.000> people<00:01:13.300> if<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.479> build

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
if we build those people if you build

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.570 
if we build those people if you build
something<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.680> slightly<00:01:14.979> outside<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
something that is slightly outside the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.150 
something that is slightly outside the
bounds<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.820> reality<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:17.590> we<00:01:17.709> make<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:17.979> real

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
bounds of reality can we make it real

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.919 
bounds of reality can we make it real
enough<00:01:18.429> we<00:01:18.759> want<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> double<00:01:19.720> take

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
enough we want that kind of double take

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.999 
enough we want that kind of double take
where<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.830> feels<00:01:21.039> like<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.690> 1886<00:01:23.410> that<00:01:23.770> was

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
where it feels like the 1886 that was

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.400 
where it feels like the 1886 that was
but<00:01:24.640> then<00:01:24.819> kind<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.539> out<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.959> corny<00:01:26.229> or<00:01:26.259> I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
but then kind of out of the corny or I

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.570 
but then kind of out of the corny or I
it's<00:01:26.649> like<00:01:26.800> well<00:01:27.039> there's<00:01:27.340> certain<00:01:27.550> things

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
it's like well there's certain things

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580 
it's like well there's certain things
where<00:01:27.910> we<00:01:28.030> deliberately<00:01:28.750> kind<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.140> deviate

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
where we deliberately kind of deviate

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.710 
where we deliberately kind of deviate
from<00:01:29.830> history<00:01:30.759> just<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> have<00:01:31.300> that<00:01:31.330> balance

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
from history just to have that balance

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.510 
from history just to have that balance
between<00:01:32.050> getting<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.679> first<00:01:32.950> read<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
between getting that first read of

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.669 
between getting that first read of
believability<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.720> sort<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.349> second

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
believability and sort of the second

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.469 
believability and sort of the second
rate<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.979> wow<00:01:36.399> that's<00:01:36.700> kind<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.090> cool<00:01:37.300> and

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
rate of wow that's kind of cool and

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.240 
rate of wow that's kind of cool and
different<00:01:37.660> we<00:01:37.990> try<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.289> echo<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.740> lot<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.039> things

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
different we try to echo a lot of things

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.460 
different we try to echo a lot of things
that<00:01:39.310> were<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:40.090> were<00:01:40.149> true<00:01:40.509> off<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.899> time<00:01:41.080> we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
that were that were true off the time we

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.080 
that were that were true off the time we
didn't<00:01:41.619> want<00:01:41.739> to<00:01:41.830> recreate<00:01:42.190> history<00:01:42.520> we

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
didn't want to recreate history we

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.699 
didn't want to recreate history we
wanted<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.360> twist<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.959> just<00:01:44.170> pour<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.619> over

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
wanted to twist it we just pour it over

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.100 
wanted to twist it we just pour it over
kind<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> history<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.060> era<00:01:46.270> maps

characters and and for this order when

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.009 
characters and and for this order when
we<00:02:39.550> started<00:02:39.910> actually<00:02:40.060> no<00:02:40.420> melding<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:40.989> uh

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
need to make sure that we had some

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.839 
need to make sure that we had some
control<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:47.349> early<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.950> had<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.580> lot<00:02:48.819> of

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
control we early on had a lot of

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.580 
control we early on had a lot of
elements<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.750> were<00:02:49.900> kind<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.170> more

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
elements that were kind of more

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
elements that were kind of more
fantastic<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> was<00:02:51.489> very<00:02:51.549> tempting<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.269> very

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
fantastic it was very tempting and very

fantastic it was very tempting and very
easy<00:02:52.690> early<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.530> go<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.069> we're<00:02:54.250> going

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
easy early on to go like if we're going

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.160 
easy early on to go like if we're going
to<00:02:54.400> do<00:02:54.519> alternate<00:02:54.970> history<00:02:55.299> let's<00:02:55.569> alter<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
to do alternate history let's alter the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.020 
to do alternate history let's alter the
world<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.470> lot<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.129> risk<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.549> approaching<00:02:57.970> a

world a lot the risk of approaching a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.640 
world a lot the risk of approaching a
game<00:02:58.209> like<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.080> bringing<00:02:59.560> that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
game like this and and bringing that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.020 
game like this and and bringing that

once you basically you know broken that
suspension<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.030> disbelief<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.079> no<00:03:05.290> you

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
suspension of disbelief there is no you

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.710 
suspension of disbelief there is no you
know<00:03:06.040> buying<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.760> back<00:03:06.910> from<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.360> player<00:03:07.540> that

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
know buying it back from the player that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.420 
know buying it back from the player that
kind<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:07.989> undermined<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.769> reality<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
kind of undermined the reality and the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.830 
kind of undermined the reality and the
believability<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> situations<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.720> the

believability of the situations and the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.300 
believability of the situations and the
characters<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.860> was<00:03:11.950> kind<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.160> like

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
characters and then it was kind of like

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.710 
characters and then it was kind of like
all<00:03:12.579> bets<00:03:12.940> are<00:03:13.030> off<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.480> didn't<00:03:13.660> want

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
all bets are off we didn't want

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.660 
all bets are off we didn't want
everything<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.440> be<00:03:14.470> kind<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.010> pushed<00:03:15.250> into

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
everything to be kind of pushed into

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.780 
everything to be kind of pushed into
alternate<00:03:16.660> history<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.410> more<00:03:18.340> often<00:03:18.610> not

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
alternate history so more often not

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.339 
alternate history so more often not
modes<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.299> transportation<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.170> same

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
modes of transportation is the same

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.530 
modes of transportation is the same
horse<00:03:20.920> drawn<00:03:21.099> carriages<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.360> there's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
horse drawn carriages but then there's

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.809 
horse drawn carriages but then there's
technologies<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.530> airships<00:03:24.069> that<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.640> did

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
technologies like airships that it did

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.089 
technologies like airships that it did
exist<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.510> era<00:03:25.720> but<00:03:25.989> we<00:03:26.200> kind<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.590> pushed

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
exist in that era but we kind of pushed

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.160 
exist in that era but we kind of pushed
them<00:03:27.280> ahead<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.000> time<00:03:28.209> frame<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.989> brought

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
them ahead in the time frame we brought

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.809 
them ahead in the time frame we brought
in<00:03:29.349> things<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.680> were<00:03:29.920> potentially<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:30.790> know

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
in things that were potentially you know

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.490 
in things that were potentially you know
two<00:03:31.180> three<00:03:31.510> decades<00:03:31.870> ahead<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.200> its<00:03:32.410> time

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
two three decades ahead of its time

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.970 
two three decades ahead of its time
brought<00:03:33.190> them<00:03:33.340> back<00:03:33.700> into<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.840> 1886<00:03:35.319> era<00:03:35.560> we

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
brought them back into the 1886 era we

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.009 
brought them back into the 1886 era we
were<00:03:36.069> able<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.519> keep<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.970> overall<00:03:37.450> kind<00:03:37.989> of

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
were able to keep the overall kind of

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.750 
were able to keep the overall kind of
skyline<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.680> London<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.579> see

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
skyline of London but then you see

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.190 
skyline of London but then you see
certain<00:03:39.940> things<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.660> morning<00:03:40.930> towers

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
certain things like the morning towers

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.840 
certain things like the morning towers
with<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.410> airships<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.340> searchlights

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
with the airships and the searchlights

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.550 
with the airships and the searchlights
with<00:03:43.030> them<00:03:43.209> they<00:03:43.690> give<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.019> give<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.410> this

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
with them they give it give you this

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.349 
with them they give it give you this
kind<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.859> layered<00:03:45.130> kind<00:03:45.609> of<00:03:45.670> alternate<00:03:46.090> twist

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
kind of layered kind of alternate twist

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.759 
kind of layered kind of alternate twist
to<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.660> feeling<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.139> world<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.560> that's

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
to the feeling of the world and that's

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.530 
to the feeling of the world and that's
really<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> doctrine<00:03:49.090> we<00:03:49.209> followed

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
really the doctrine we followed

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.120 
really the doctrine we followed
throughout<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> game<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.290> it's<00:03:50.650> asking<00:03:51.010> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
throughout the game it's it's asking the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.949 
throughout the game it's it's asking the
question<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.609> whether<00:03:52.090> or<00:03:52.269> not<00:03:52.359> people<00:03:52.630> today

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
question of whether or not people today

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.559 
question of whether or not people today
that<00:03:53.350> live<00:03:53.650> today<00:03:53.940> could<00:03:54.940> believe<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
that live today could believe the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.789 
that live today could believe the
fiction<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:55.989> we're<00:03:56.200> adding<00:03:56.350> into<00:03:56.650> their

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
fiction that we're adding into their

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.140 
fiction that we're adding into their
into<00:03:57.010> our<00:03:57.100> history<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.790> something<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
into our history that's something that

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.539 
into our history that's something that
sort<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.720> ties<00:03:58.900> everything<00:03:58.959> together<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.799> make

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
sort of ties everything together to make

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.849 
sort of ties everything together to make
it<00:04:00.639> feel<00:04:00.850> like<00:04:01.120> an<00:04:01.329> era<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.870> existed<00:04:02.500> kind<00:04:02.799> of

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
it feel like an era that existed kind of

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.349 
it feel like an era that existed kind of
out<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> place<00:04:03.340> sometime<00:04:03.790> what's<00:04:04.239> so

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
out of place sometime what's so

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.699 
out of place sometime what's so
fascinating<00:04:04.569> about<00:04:04.930> history<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.470> that

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
fascinating about history is that

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.770 
fascinating about history is that
regardless<00:04:06.160> of<00:04:06.549> all<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.760> fiction<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.389> write<00:04:07.569> I

regardless of all the fiction we write I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.479 
regardless of all the fiction we write I
don't<00:04:07.989> think<00:04:08.349> it's<00:04:08.470> ever<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.829> mysterious<00:04:09.220> as

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
don't think it's ever as mysterious as

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.000
