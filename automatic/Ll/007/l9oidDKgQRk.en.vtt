00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
grocery shopping brats are the first

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.670 
grocery shopping brats are the first
place<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.000> want<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> start<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.410> hear

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
place you want to start now you hear

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.229 
place you want to start now you hear
that<00:00:16.800> wheat<00:00:17.009> bread<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.430> healthy<00:00:17.790> has<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> lot<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:18.239 
that wheat bread as healthy has a lot of

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.580 
that wheat bread as healthy has a lot of
fiber<00:00:18.540> and<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:18.960> what<00:00:19.079> you<00:00:19.140> want<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> buy

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
fiber and that's what you want to buy

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.350 
fiber and that's what you want to buy
but<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> problem<00:00:20.700> is<00:00:20.849> that<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
but the problem is that a lot of

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.990 
but the problem is that a lot of
packages<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.349> misleading<00:00:22.649> for<00:00:23.610> example

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
packages are very misleading for example

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
packages are very misleading for example
this<00:00:24.180> wheat<00:00:24.450> bread<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:25.079> you<00:00:25.890> would<00:00:25.980> read

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
this wheat bread here you would read

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.710 
this wheat bread here you would read
this<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.520> think<00:00:26.700> great<00:00:26.910> wheat<00:00:27.149> bread<00:00:27.419> it<00:00:27.540> must

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
this and think great wheat bread it must

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.909 
this and think great wheat bread it must
have<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.899> lot<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.079> fiber<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.559> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.770> get

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
have a lot of fiber I'm going to get

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.530 
have a lot of fiber I'm going to get
this<00:00:29.040> one<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.790> the<00:00:29.880> problem<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.419> you

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
this one but the problem is when you

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.210 
this one but the problem is when you
look<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.930> label<00:00:31.320> you'll<00:00:31.770> see<00:00:31.919> that<00:00:32.070> one

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
look at the label you'll see that one

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.150 
look at the label you'll see that one
slice<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.669> bread<00:00:32.780> contains<00:00:33.780> less<00:00:34.739> than<00:00:35.010> 1<00:00:35.129> gram

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
slice of bread contains less than 1 gram

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520 
slice of bread contains less than 1 gram
of<00:00:35.399> fiber<00:00:35.670> per<00:00:35.850> slice<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.690> pretty<00:00:37.170> low

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of fiber per slice so that's pretty low

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
of fiber per slice so that's pretty low
you<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> look<00:00:38.699> for<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> bread<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you want to look for a bread that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
you want to look for a bread that
contains<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.750> least<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:40.230> grams<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.679> more<00:00:40.710> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
contains at least three grams or more of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
contains at least three grams or more of
fiber<00:00:41.219> per<00:00:41.399> serving<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.420> even<00:00:42.690> though<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
fiber per serving so even though this

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
fiber per serving so even though this
says<00:00:43.199> wheat<00:00:43.410> bread<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.039> is<00:00:44.190> super<00:00:44.609> low<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
says wheat bread this is super low in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
says wheat bread this is super low in
fiber<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.449> would<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.929> good<00:00:46.320> choice<00:00:46.530> now

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
fiber and would not be a good choice now

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860 
fiber and would not be a good choice now
this<00:00:47.550> bread<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.059> example<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.539> says<00:00:48.749> one

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this bread for example this says one

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.329 
this bread for example this says one
hundred<00:00:49.079> percent<00:00:49.109> whole<00:00:49.559> week<00:00:49.769> so<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> sounds

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
hundred percent whole week so it sounds

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.040 
hundred percent whole week so it sounds
a<00:00:50.519> little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.760> healthier<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.359> when<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:51.899> read

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a little bit healthier and when you read

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
a little bit healthier and when you read
the<00:00:52.170> label<00:00:52.499> you'll<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.159> slice<00:00:53.489> has

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the label you'll see that one slice has

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
the label you'll see that one slice has
three<00:00:54.390> grams<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> fiber<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.260> that'd<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.499> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
three grams of fiber so that'd be a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
three grams of fiber so that'd be a
great<00:00:55.800> choice<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:56.909> be<00:00:56.999> a<00:00:57.030> lot

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
great choice this would be a lot

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
great choice this would be a lot
healthier<00:00:57.449> fiber<00:00:57.960> helps<00:00:58.489> lower<00:00:59.489> your

healthier fiber helps lower your
cholesterol<00:00:59.819> also<00:01:00.480> helps<00:01:00.719> keep<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

regular<00:01:01.499> very<00:01:01.829> healthy<00:01:02.159> thing<00:01:02.339> to<00:01:02.370> include<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
regular very healthy thing to include in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.540 
regular very healthy thing to include in
your<00:01:02.909> diet<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.230> 25<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:05.070> 35

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
your diet you want to get about 25 to 35

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.880 
your diet you want to get about 25 to 35
grams<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.180> fiber<00:01:06.390> per<00:01:06.540> day<00:01:06.899> so<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.710> would<00:01:07.860> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
grams of fiber per day so this would be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
grams of fiber per day so this would be
a<00:01:07.979> healthy<00:01:08.340> choice<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.850> bread<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.240> you're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a healthy choice for bread if you're

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
a healthy choice for bread if you're
going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> sandwich<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.409> you'd<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
going to make a sandwich then you'd have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
going to make a sandwich then you'd have
you<00:01:11.100> double<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.759> you'd<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:11.909> six<00:01:12.180> grams

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you double that so you'd have six grams

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.289 
you double that so you'd have six grams
of<00:01:12.750> fiber<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> each<00:01:14.310> slice<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.640> three<00:01:15.030> grams

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
of fiber so each slice is three grams

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
of fiber so each slice is three grams
you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> even<00:01:16.140> find<00:01:16.439> breads<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> five

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you can even find breads that have five

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.870 
you can even find breads that have five
grams<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.759> fiber<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> even<00:01:18.630> better

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
grams of fiber which is even better

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
grams of fiber which is even better
tortillas<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.060> another<00:01:21.329> thing<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> people

the<00:01:32.549> problem<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> look<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.719> the

the problem is when you look at the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.289 
the problem is when you look at the
label<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> back<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> package<00:01:35.700> first

of<00:01:36.539> all<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.930> tortilla<00:01:37.259> contains<00:01:37.890> 210

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of all one tortilla contains 210

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.639 
of all one tortilla contains 210
calories<00:01:39.210> which<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> high<00:01:40.259> amount<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
calories which is a high amount of

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.249 
calories which is a high amount of
calories<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> fiber<00:01:42.600> amount<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.110> only

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
calories also the fiber amount is only

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469 
calories also the fiber amount is only
one<00:01:43.560> gram<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.969> you<00:01:45.060> look<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
one gram and when you look at the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.670 
one gram and when you look at the
ingredients<00:01:45.600> you're<00:01:46.289> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> see

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
ingredients you're going to see

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620 
ingredients you're going to see
partially<00:01:47.159> hydrogenated<00:01:47.490> oil<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
partially hydrogenated oil on the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
partially hydrogenated oil on the
ingredient<00:01:49.079> list<00:01:49.109> and<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> means<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
ingredient list and that means that that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550 
ingredient list and that means that that
contains<00:01:50.969> trans<00:01:51.390> fat<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.289> healthy

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
contains trans fat which is not healthy

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490 
contains trans fat which is not healthy
at<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.920> trans<00:01:53.310> fat<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.479> heart-healthy<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
at all trans fat is not heart-healthy it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.249 
at all trans fat is not heart-healthy it
will<00:01:56.219> raise<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:57.240> bad<00:01:57.420> cholesterol<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
will raise your bad cholesterol and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
will raise your bad cholesterol and
lower<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.280> cholesterol<00:01:59.460> which<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lower your good cholesterol which is the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.290 
lower your good cholesterol which is the
HDL

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
HDL

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.570 
HDL
so<00:02:01.930> trans<00:02:02.260> fat<00:02:02.530> will<00:02:02.770> raise<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.100> LDL

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
so trans fat will raise that LDL

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.040 
so trans fat will raise that LDL
cholesterol<00:02:03.760> which<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.570> unhealthy

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
cholesterol which is the unhealthy

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.600 
cholesterol which is the unhealthy
cholesterol<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:05.740> lower<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.490> good

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
cholesterol and lower the good

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.880 
cholesterol and lower the good
cholesterol<00:02:06.790> HDL<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.260> want<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.650> avoid

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
cholesterol HDL so you want to avoid

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.040 
cholesterol HDL so you want to avoid
products<00:02:09.520> with<00:02:09.670> trans<00:02:09.940> fat<00:02:10.270> now<00:02:10.810> when<00:02:10.960> you

trans fat or the partially hydrogenated

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.410 
trans fat or the partially hydrogenated
oil<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.580> why<00:02:33.700> they're<00:02:33.850> able<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> say<00:02:34.270> it's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
oil that's why they're able to say it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.640 
oil that's why they're able to say it's
zero<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.960> you've<00:02:35.080> got<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.350> check<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
zero so you've got to check the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.890 
zero so you've got to check the
ingredient<00:02:36.100> list<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.850> again<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:37.510> tortilla

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
ingredient list so again this tortilla

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.920 
ingredient list so again this tortilla
very<00:02:38.680> high<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:38.890> calories<00:02:39.460> contains<00:02:40.360> trans<00:02:40.660> fat

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
very high in calories contains trans fat

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.830 
very high in calories contains trans fat
in<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.440> very<00:02:41.710> low<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:41.950> fiber<00:02:42.660> now<00:02:43.660> these

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
in this very low in fiber now these

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.530 
in this very low in fiber now these
tortillas<00:02:44.410> say<00:02:44.800> yellow<00:02:45.040> corn<00:02:45.430> tortillas<00:02:45.940> corn

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
tortillas say yellow corn tortillas corn

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.480 
tortillas say yellow corn tortillas corn
can<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> great<00:02:47.110> source<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.500> fiber<00:02:47.680> when<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
can be a great source of fiber when you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.830 
can be a great source of fiber when you
read<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> ingredients<00:02:49.300> you'll<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.660> see

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
read the ingredients you'll just see

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.770 
read the ingredients you'll just see
ground<00:02:50.170> corn<00:02:50.560> lime<00:02:51.160> water<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.600> few

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
ground corn lime water and a few

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.600 
ground corn lime water and a few
preservatives<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:53.890> very<00:02:54.010> healthy

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
preservatives so very very healthy

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.760 
preservatives so very very healthy
choice<00:02:54.850> two<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.780> these<00:02:55.900> tortillas<00:02:56.440> which<00:02:56.680> you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
choice two of these tortillas which you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.440 
choice two of these tortillas which you
would<00:02:56.920> about<00:02:57.130> equal<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.610> one<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> these<00:02:58.030> larger

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
would about equal to one of these larger

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.870 
would about equal to one of these larger
ones<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:58.870> two<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.110> them<00:02:59.350> contain<00:03:00.010> only<00:03:00.130> 110

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
ones so two of them contain only 110

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.550 
ones so two of them contain only 110
calories<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.570> about<00:03:01.780> half<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.290> amount<00:03:02.380> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
calories so about half of the amount of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.020 
calories so about half of the amount of
calories<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:02.950> were<00:03:03.190> found<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.550> just<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:03.880> of

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
calories that were found in just one of

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.300 
calories that were found in just one of
these<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:04.570> they<00:03:05.290> contain<00:03:05.590> three<00:03:05.800> grams<00:03:06.100> of

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
these and they contain three grams of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.160 
these and they contain three grams of
fiber<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:07.030> that'd<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> great<00:03:07.510> choice<00:03:07.840> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
fiber so that'd be a great choice so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.860 
fiber so that'd be a great choice so
this<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.680> something<00:03:08.890> no<00:03:09.130> trans<00:03:09.459> fat<00:03:09.790> lower<00:03:10.600> in

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
this is something no trans fat lower in

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.990 
this is something no trans fat lower in
calories<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.440> high<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:11.950> fiber<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.850> these

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
calories and high in fiber so these

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.850 
calories and high in fiber so these
yellow<00:03:13.300> corn<00:03:13.840> tortillas<00:03:14.320> are<00:03:14.440> very<00:03:14.590> very

label you'll see first of all the
calories<00:03:48.760> are<00:03:49.209> about<00:03:49.360> 120<00:03:49.900> calories<00:03:50.320> for

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
calories are about 120 calories for

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.430 
calories are about 120 calories for
three-quarters<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.520> cup<00:03:51.550> that's<00:03:51.970> ok<00:03:52.440> but

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
three-quarters of a cup that's ok but

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.660 
three-quarters of a cup that's ok but
then<00:03:53.590> you're<00:03:53.650> going<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.920> look<00:03:54.100> down<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.459> see

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
then you're going to look down and see

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670 
then you're going to look down and see
the<00:03:54.700> fibers<00:03:55.030> only<00:03:55.510> one<00:03:55.720> gram<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:55.989> fiber<00:03:56.320> so

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
the fibers only one gram of fiber so

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.530 
the fibers only one gram of fiber so
that's<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.950> very<00:03:57.220> very<00:03:57.459> low<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.910> fiber<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
that's a very very low in fiber and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.479 
that's a very very low in fiber and
cereal<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.590> great<00:03:59.800> way<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.980> get<00:04:00.160> your<00:04:00.280> daily

cereal is a great way to get your daily

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.550 
cereal is a great way to get your daily
fiber<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:01.360> pick<00:04:01.600> this<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:02.170> kind<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.470> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
fiber so if you pick this this kind of a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.590 
fiber so if you pick this this kind of a
cereal<00:04:02.920> without<00:04:03.040> much<00:04:03.400> fiber<00:04:03.700> you're<00:04:04.300> really

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
cereal without much fiber you're really

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.850 
cereal without much fiber you're really
it's<00:04:04.810> really<00:04:04.959> going<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.320> tough<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.739> to

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's really going to be tough for you to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.320 
it's really going to be tough for you to
get<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.100> fiber<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.550> needed<00:04:06.880> throughout<00:04:07.120> your

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
get the fiber you needed throughout your

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.990 
get the fiber you needed throughout your
day<00:04:07.650> also<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.800> sugars<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.340> contains<00:04:09.730> 11

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
day also the sugars this contains 11

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.370 
day also the sugars this contains 11
grams<00:04:10.300> of<00:04:10.510> sugar<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:10.990> it's<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.170> little<00:04:11.290> bit

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
grams of sugar so it's a little bit

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.590 
grams of sugar so it's a little bit
higher<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.860> sugar

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
higher in sugar

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.660 
higher in sugar
so<00:04:13.080> something<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:14.100> calories<00:04:14.520> are

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
so something like this the calories are

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.550 
so something like this the calories are
usually<00:04:14.940> okay<00:04:15.240> in<00:04:15.360> most<00:04:15.570> cereals<00:04:16.020> not<00:04:16.260> too

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
usually okay in most cereals not too

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.820 
usually okay in most cereals not too
high<00:04:17.360> but<00:04:18.360> again<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.080> low<00:04:19.290> in<00:04:19.440> fiber<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
high but again it's low in fiber and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.229 
high but again it's low in fiber and
high<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.220> sugar<00:04:20.490> so<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.820> wouldn't<00:04:21.060> be<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
high in sugar so it wouldn't be the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.170 
high in sugar so it wouldn't be the
healthiest<00:04:21.690> choice<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.610> cereal<00:04:23.610> like<00:04:23.730> this<00:04:23.940> one

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
healthiest choice a cereal like this one

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.090 
healthiest choice a cereal like this one
fiber<00:04:24.450> one<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.260> can<00:04:25.380> tell<00:04:25.560> from<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.890> name<00:04:25.920> of

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
fiber one you can tell from the name of

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.040 
fiber one you can tell from the name of
the<00:04:26.310> cereal<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.360> probably<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.810> higher<00:04:28.020> in

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
the cereal that it probably is higher in

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.260 
the cereal that it probably is higher in
fiber<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.130> when<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.730> look<00:04:29.880> at<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> on

here<00:04:35.430> you'll<00:04:35.940> see<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.210> first<00:04:36.450> ingredient

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
here you'll see the first ingredient

here you'll see the first ingredient
listed<00:04:37.260> as<00:04:37.350> whole-grain<00:04:37.770> wheat<00:04:37.890> so<00:04:38.640> that's<00:04:38.850> a

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
listed as whole-grain wheat so that's a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.460 
calories and then the fiber it contains
13<00:04:47.370> grams<00:04:47.730> of<00:04:48.030> fiber<00:04:48.270> that's<00:04:48.600> very<00:04:48.960> very<00:04:49.230> high

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
13 grams of fiber that's very very high

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.160 
13 grams of fiber that's very very high
so<00:04:49.920> 13<00:04:50.430> grams<00:04:50.670> as<00:04:50.970> opposed<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.750> one<00:04:51.900> gram

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
so 13 grams as opposed to the one gram

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.140 
so 13 grams as opposed to the one gram
in<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.470> cereal<00:04:52.920> and<00:04:53.130> then<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.700> sugars<00:04:54.030> that

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
in this cereal and then the sugars that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.420 
in this cereal and then the sugars that
contains<00:04:54.450> only<00:04:54.690> 6<00:04:54.960> grams<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.410> sugar<00:04:55.620> versus

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
contains only 6 grams of sugar versus

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.550 
contains only 6 grams of sugar versus
the<00:04:56.550> 11<00:04:56.910> grams<00:04:57.090> found<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.690> higher<00:04:58.290> sugar

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
the 11 grams found in this higher sugar

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.620 
the 11 grams found in this higher sugar
cereal<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.670> this<00:04:59.820> would<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.120> very<00:05:00.390> very
