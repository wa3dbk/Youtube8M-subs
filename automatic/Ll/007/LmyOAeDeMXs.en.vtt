that<00:00:26.010> said<00:00:26.310> off<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.349> grid<00:00:28.590> that's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that said off we go now the grid that's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
that said off we go now the grid that's
going<00:00:29.099> across<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.580> room<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.720> hits

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
going across the room there if it hits

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
going across the room there if it hits
our<00:00:31.080> pathway<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.710> we're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.040> across<00:00:32.309> it'll

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
our pathway as we're going across it'll

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
our pathway as we're going across it'll
be<00:00:32.790> synchronized<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.600> we'll<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> go

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
be synchronized and we'll have to go

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
be synchronized and we'll have to go
back<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> beginning<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.219> party<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
back to the beginning of this party so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
back to the beginning of this party so
we're<00:00:36.510> gonna<00:00:36.690> try<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> enough<00:00:37.140> wait<00:00:37.320> they'll

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
we're gonna try it enough wait they'll

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.979 
we're gonna try it enough wait they'll
know<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.390> our<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.660> over<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
know so we got to make our way over to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.440 
know so we got to make our way over to
the<00:00:40.140> doorway<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.090> let<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the doorway here so we're gonna let the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:54.439 
the doorway here so we're gonna let the
grid<00:00:42.600> pass<00:00:42.840> us<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> off<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.620> again

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.889 

now<00:00:55.019> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.289> select<00:00:55.440> multiple<00:00:55.800> shapes<00:00:56.309> for

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
now you can select multiple shapes for

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
now you can select multiple shapes for
climbing<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.500> moving<00:00:58.769> across<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.190> room

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
climbing or just moving across the room

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.570 
climbing or just moving across the room
it's<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> by<00:00:59.969> using<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.329> r1<00:01:01.140> traders

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.460 

now<00:01:07.150> as<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.420> see<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.810> room<00:01:07.990> there<00:01:08.260> is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
now as you see that room there is

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.260 
now as you see that room there is
blocked<00:01:08.770> by<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.920> force<00:01:09.190> field<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.730> what<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.090> need

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
blocked by a force field so what we need

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
blocked by a force field so what we need
to<00:01:10.300> do<00:01:10.480> is<00:01:10.660> we<00:01:10.840> need<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.080> go<00:01:11.200> back<00:01:11.440> this<00:01:12.130> is

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to do is we need to go back this is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.830 
to do is we need to go back this is
where<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.610> came<00:01:12.820> down<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.210> up<00:01:13.300> here<00:01:13.510> you<00:01:13.660> see

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
where we came down and up here you see

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.000 
where we came down and up here you see
so<00:01:14.140> we're<00:01:14.290> heading<00:01:14.530> down<00:01:14.710> below<00:01:15.130> there<00:01:17.010> as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
so we're heading down below there as

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.650 
so we're heading down below there as
soon<00:01:18.190> as<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.340> get<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.640> pathway<00:01:19.090> sorry<00:01:19.420> about

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
soon as I get the pathway sorry about

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.800 
soon as I get the pathway sorry about
that<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.810> make<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.050> couple<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:21.210> mistakes<00:01:22.210> with<00:01:22.630> my

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
that I make a couple of mistakes with my

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.930 
that I make a couple of mistakes with my
level<00:01:23.020> here<00:01:23.320> Oh<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.930> out<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.170> way<00:01:29.940> and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
there's a tall we we need to get to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.810 
there's a tall we we need to get to
there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.850 

so<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.480> need<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.750> get<00:01:37.870> there<00:01:38.050> on<00:01:38.290> we<00:01:38.500> need<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.740> go

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
so we need to get there on we need to go

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.700 
so we need to get there on we need to go
over<00:01:38.890> an<00:01:39.220> activate<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.670> switch<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.440> can<00:01:41.560> see

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
over an activate a switch as you can see

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.870 
over an activate a switch as you can see
it's<00:01:41.860> guarded<00:01:42.160> by<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.720> bunch<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.900> lasers<00:01:44.880> we

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's guarded by a bunch of lasers we

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.160 
it's guarded by a bunch of lasers we
don't<00:01:46.060> wanna<00:01:46.180> hit<00:01:46.330> them<00:01:46.510> either<00:01:49.050> thought<00:01:50.050> we

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
don't wanna hit them either thought we

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.870 
don't wanna hit them either thought we
got<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.380> timer<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.570> there<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:52.960> go<00:01:53.760> so<00:01:54.760> we

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
got a timer and there we go so we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.490 
got a timer and there we go so we
activate<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.360> switch<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.810> as<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.140> see<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
activate the switch and as you see the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.110 
activate the switch and as you see the
doorway<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.040> was<00:01:57.280> blocked<00:01:57.640> by<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.820> force

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
doorway that was blocked by the force

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.600 
doorway that was blocked by the force
field<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.510> no<00:01:58.750> clear<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> off<00:02:05.680> we<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:05.920> again

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.190 

make<00:02:09.610> our<00:02:09.729> way<00:02:09.820> past<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.209> lasers<00:02:12.990> now<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.020> just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
make our way past the lasers now I just

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.690 
make our way past the lasers now I just
let<00:02:14.500> myself<00:02:14.620> drop<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.160> then<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.459> hit<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
let myself drop and then just hit the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.850 
let myself drop and then just hit the
activate<00:02:16.060> one<00:02:16.240> for<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.510> pathway

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.199 

and<00:02:24.860> here's<00:02:25.190> another<00:02:25.340> one<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.879> was<00:02:25.940> nasty

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
and here's another one that I was nasty

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.729 
and here's another one that I was nasty
little<00:02:26.510> peasants<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.290> us<00:02:29.170> again<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.560> need<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
little peasants for us again we need to

past I died a couple of times there so

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.080 
past I died a couple of times there so
just<00:04:40.979> for<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.370> length<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.760> video<00:04:41.880> I

just for the length of the video I

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.120 
just for the length of the video I
shortened<00:04:42.630> up<00:04:42.690> back<00:04:42.840> down<00:04:42.870> again<00:04:43.320> editor<00:04:43.770> bad

mistake<00:04:46.760> as<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.910> can<00:04:48.000> see<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.150> use<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.510> ramp

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
mistake as you can see I use the ramp

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.180 
mistake as you can see I use the ramp
one<00:04:48.930> here<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.320> get<00:04:49.440> across<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:55.100> we're<00:04:56.100> getting

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
one here to get across so we're getting

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.070 
one here to get across so we're getting
there<00:04:56.370> nearly<00:04:56.760> there

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.200 

so<00:05:01.080> another<00:05:01.889> laser<00:05:02.160> defense<00:05:02.520> system<00:05:02.669> here<00:05:03.090> we

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
so another laser defense system here we

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.540 
so another laser defense system here we
need<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.449> get<00:05:03.570> past<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:05.040> what<00:05:05.130> we're<00:05:05.280> gonna<00:05:05.370> do

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
need to get past so what we're gonna do

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.950 
need to get past so what we're gonna do
here<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:05.790> we're<00:05:05.940> gonna<00:05:06.090> block<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.600> lasers

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
here is we're gonna block the lasers

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.780 
here is we're gonna block the lasers
with<00:05:07.199> their<00:05:07.410> bare<00:05:07.680> ears<00:05:10.220> as<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.370> see<00:05:11.520> once<00:05:11.699> you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
with their bare ears as you see once you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.460 
with their bare ears as you see once you
put<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> berry<00:05:12.210> in<00:05:12.360> place<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.780> just<00:05:12.990> cuts<00:05:13.410> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
put the berry in place it just cuts the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.930 
put the berry in place it just cuts the
laser<00:05:13.710> off<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.160> we're<00:05:14.310> gonna<00:05:14.370> get<00:05:14.610> down<00:05:14.729> here

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
laser off so we're gonna get down here

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.340 
laser off so we're gonna get down here
now<00:05:15.120> just<00:05:15.330> be<00:05:16.110> aware<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.560> is<00:05:16.620> timed

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
now just be aware that that is timed

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.129 
now just be aware that that is timed
once<00:05:19.350> you<00:05:19.440> put<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.740> place<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.460> lasers<00:05:21.030> will

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
once you put it in place the lasers will

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.409 
once you put it in place the lasers will
take<00:05:22.139> over<00:05:22.350> again<00:05:22.880> if<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:23.970> don't<00:05:24.120> get<00:05:24.240> through

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
take over again if you don't get through

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.350 
take over again if you don't get through
in<00:05:24.570> time<00:05:28.490> sorry<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.550> wasn't<00:05:29.729> explaining<00:05:30.150> that

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
in time sorry I wasn't explaining that

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.060 
in time sorry I wasn't explaining that
very<00:05:30.419> well<00:05:30.860> now<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.010> one<00:05:32.220> here<00:05:33.949> so<00:05:34.949> there's

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
very well now this one here so there's

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.900 
very well now this one here so there's
an<00:05:35.220> upward<00:05:36.410> gravity<00:05:37.410> stream<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.550> what<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.789> did

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
an upward gravity stream so what we did

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.520 
an upward gravity stream so what we did
was<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.120> just<00:05:39.150> release<00:05:39.780> our<00:05:39.960> pathway<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.470> it

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
was you just release our pathway and it

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.200 
was you just release our pathway and it
floats<00:05:40.800> up<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.130> blocks<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.460> lasers<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:42.060> it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
floats up and blocks the lasers and it

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.120 
floats up and blocks the lasers and it
does<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.479> indefinitely<00:05:43.080> there's<00:05:43.560> no<00:05:43.650> timer<00:05:43.949> on

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
does it indefinitely there's no timer on

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.060 
does it indefinitely there's no timer on
that<00:05:44.280> parent<00:05:44.660> so<00:05:45.660> we<00:05:45.690> here<00:05:45.870> our<00:05:45.990> switch<00:05:46.199> and<00:05:46.530> we

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
that parent so we here our switch and we

us we're counting on you Lucy you have
served<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.610> temple<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:07.930> we<00:07:08.710> never<00:07:09.100> forget

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
served the temple and we never forget

served the temple and we never forget
loyalty<00:07:10.030> oh<00:07:11.700> yes<00:07:12.930> once<00:07:13.930> inside<00:07:14.890> their<00:07:15.190> hideout

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
loyalty oh yes once inside their hideout

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.930 
loyalty oh yes once inside their hideout
perhaps<00:07:16.900> you<00:07:17.080> might<00:07:17.260> ask<00:07:17.590> the<00:07:17.860> assassins<00:07:18.460> why

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
perhaps you might ask the assassins why

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:32.500 
perhaps you might ask the assassins why
he<00:07:19.120> left<00:07:19.390> you<00:07:19.540> alone<00:07:19.720> for<00:07:20.590> so<00:07:21.100> many<00:07:21.490> years

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.710 

so<00:07:33.200> it<00:07:33.410> looks<00:07:33.590> like<00:07:33.650> Lucy<00:07:34.250> wasn't<00:07:34.490> an<00:07:34.850> agent

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
so it looks like Lucy wasn't an agent

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.610 
so it looks like Lucy wasn't an agent
but<00:07:36.590> don't<00:07:36.830> forget<00:07:37.360> the<00:07:38.360> assassin<00:07:38.930> center<00:07:39.380> in
