00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.290
 to this speed tutorial 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 I want you one today 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 imagine you live in the project 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.939
 You can use it for chase too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 escape and kill your opponents 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.029
 the trap looks like this I am yes 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.160
 actually pretty sure he did that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.340
 Child was through a deep hole and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 At the bottom of the hole was water 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 because if you are in survival since and on 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 the water hits then it does not matter how 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.969
 you fall deep, you do not get it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.440
 dying does not hurt 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.510
 the special here is that it is not 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.950
 normal water is but that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.200
 behind it a pretty long time 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 mechanism I put it I show it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 Just have a zombie with you now 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 the spawn falls down and that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.489
 water hole down here is the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.829
 zombie completely intact but each 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 person who would have followed the zombie now 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 would have died of it 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.939
 The whole thing looks like it falls out of her 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.260
 down here are signs and here 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
 the upper part of the pool is strengthened by this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.369
 not her and when you drop her 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 directly on these printing plates these 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 printing plates are down here with western 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.950
 A signal is high on her 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.619
 at the slopes is also on the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.829
 drive the other side and the slopes 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.400
 as soon as someone out there is down there 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.930
 up from here they are that is if 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.729
 you are just being followed and here 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.250
 you will not jump down 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.229
 but whoever comes after that when he dies 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
 only for half a second or longer 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.759
 after you go jumping like it right 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 The problem now is 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.340
 you guys, jump here now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.990
 under it, that survives like the zombie 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 but if the enemy is up here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.469
 Of course , then he will also see that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 the water hole has disappeared and 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.280
 therefore he will not jump down anymore 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.440
 so it is not like that with stones 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 smart to always have gone 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.470
 then unlearned uses something like that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 Like glass in some textures packages 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.560
 or with some students linked 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.610
 the glass rather to a multi blog that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.590
 means one sees as none at all 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.940
 cross striving more 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:27.620
 and if someone falls down below 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.420
 if you jump down here now if 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.980
 The textures are then joined 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
 you do not get anything in it for nothing 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 if the opponent is just pretty 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 stressed because I'm still persecuted 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.820
 so he does not see it directly 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.680
 so that was it again with this 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.630
 tutorial i hope this pleases 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.580
 I would be very positive about that 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.240
 evaluation happy and otherwise nice evening 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.240
 and see you soon
