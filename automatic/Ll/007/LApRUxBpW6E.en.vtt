fig<00:02:09.509> that's<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.899> most<00:02:10.080> fragrances<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.769> think<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
fig that's in most fragrances I think it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.790 
fig that's in most fragrances I think it
when<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.489> done<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.300> bit<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:13.319> guess<00:02:13.739> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
when it's done a little bit I guess you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
when it's done a little bit I guess you
could<00:02:13.920> say<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> conscious<00:02:14.819> side<00:02:15.000> that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
could say on the conscious side that's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.500 
could say on the conscious side that's
when<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.489> tend<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.849> those<00:02:18.030> fragrances<00:02:18.269> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
when I tend to like those fragrances a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
when I tend to like those fragrances a
little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:18.780> more<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.140> when<00:02:19.260> big<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
little bit more but when big is the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.490 
little bit more but when big is the
prominent<00:02:20.310> note<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.730> tend<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.840> agree<00:02:22.290> with

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
prominent note I tend not to agree with

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.530 
prominent note I tend not to agree with
it<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.799> unfortunately<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.970> fragrance<00:02:24.360> kind

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it and unfortunately this fragrance kind

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.210 
it and unfortunately this fragrance kind
of<00:02:24.599> lands<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.230> realm<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.739> first<00:02:25.980> thing

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
of lands in that realm the first thing

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
of lands in that realm the first thing
that<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.730> immediately<00:02:27.569> as<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> baby<00:02:28.170> smell

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that you get immediately as a baby smell

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.830 
that you get immediately as a baby smell
to<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.519> says<00:02:29.760> big<00:02:30.000> leaf<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.720> have

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
to it now that says big leaf and I have

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
to it now that says big leaf and I have
to<00:02:30.989> agree<00:02:31.080> with<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.379> because<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.069> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to agree with that because it's a more

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.850 
to agree with that because it's a more
of<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.640> green<00:02:32.970> thing<00:02:33.420> coming<00:02:34.319> from<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.650> rather

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
of a green thing coming from it rather

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
of a green thing coming from it rather
than<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.549> real<00:02:35.880> pure<00:02:36.209> fruit<00:02:36.540> from<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:36.989> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
than the real pure fruit from it but it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.350 
than the real pure fruit from it but it
definitely<00:02:37.590> still<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> big<00:02:38.459> sin<00:02:38.790> now

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
definitely still is a big sin now

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
this way I would say that this kind of

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.000 
this way I would say that this kind of
reminds<00:04:38.660> me<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:38.960> version<00:04:39.440> Island<00:04:39.800> water

island water does have but the coconut
vibe<00:04:46.880> from<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.330> really<00:04:47.600> reminds<00:04:47.900> me<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.200> it

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.450 
vibe from it really reminds me of it
that's<00:04:48.680> not<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.979> say<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.340> two

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
that's not to say that the two

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.950 
that's not to say that the two
fragrances<00:04:49.669> smell<00:04:50.000> like<00:04:50.360> because<00:04:50.870> they

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
fragrances smell like because they

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.820 
fragrances smell like because they
definitely<00:04:51.139> go<00:04:51.410> in<00:04:51.530> different<00:04:51.650> directions

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
definitely go in different directions

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.530 
definitely go in different directions
but<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.639> kind<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.910> give<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.120> an<00:04:53.240> idea

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
but that's the kind of give you an idea

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.320 
but that's the kind of give you an idea
of<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:54.410> coconut<00:04:54.950> fig<00:04:55.490> vibe<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.940> I'm<00:04:56.060> getting

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330

I think that's one of the strong points
in<00:05:00.680> this<00:05:00.740> fragrance<00:05:01.100> is<00:05:01.160> that<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.370> can<00:05:01.520> use<00:05:01.669> it
