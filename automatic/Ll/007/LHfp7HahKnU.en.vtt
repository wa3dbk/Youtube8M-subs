00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.670
 those things 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.040
 logically growing up in a neighborhood like that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.540
 as an agile unnim where everyone lives one 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.180
 on top of another like that that money and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.130
 The whole open sea is simple 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 believe that one is not going to do anything else in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.200
 life is going to be dedicated to the call 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.610
 center or be a taxi driver or disguise 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.650
 doctor simi from time to time to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930

 because the silver pin was thrown because the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 band is that I also wanted to have 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 another another goal so that we did not pass 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:15.170
 talking 50 years of the same shit that 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 is asking my space that some 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.269
 way to think and seek attention towards 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.760
 mine because that ideal is that ideal 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.459
 is that the siesta that I am the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.260
 protagonist who is caught is 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.880
 like when I want to leave some 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.780
 who are ignorant whether or not it is 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.970

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.709
 conclusion so that the episodes of the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 supercampeones it was impossible to make the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.970

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.530
