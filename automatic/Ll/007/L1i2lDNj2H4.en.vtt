00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.540
 this is gambling flashback in games 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.889
 which we grew up with is in chine 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.889
 mr van rayn 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.360
 the second coming of gordon freeman in 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.750
 their time waited no less than 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.029
 Now waiting for the first 3 half-life of many 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.340
 opened my eyes to what can be 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.400
 games it was a breakthrough like game 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.460
 designer and technological nowhere 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.100
 we have not seen before this it such 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.180
 alien spaces such filing 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.360
 plot and here came half-life 2 and what 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 called not disgrace immaculate on 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.150
 that moment of graphics is varied 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.199
 gameplay 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:58.040
 lots of conversations and interesting characters 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:01:00.229
 Gravipushka at the end then half-life ends 2 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.239
 was specially built so that 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.870
 constantly throwing new player 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.240
 entertainment ran on foot cross over 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.049
 typewriter on a wheel 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.260
 transport 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.780
 welcome aboard the boat and here 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.240
 even a special level horror style 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.630
 where a lot of zombies and you can hurl 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.909
 discs from circular saws different types 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.030
 gameplay followed each other shooting 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 remained to horror tactile from and to 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.130
 and how much joy caused 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.979
 realistic physics and built on it 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.289
 riddles and no less enthusiasm caused 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.030
 Gordon Freeman himself 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.100
 silent hero of the game who once 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 was a simple nuclear physicist 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.250
 but then picked up the mount and how 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 throughout the series he never 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.490
 uttered not a word 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.429
 however, this was largely offset 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.969
 the fact that all the others were crackling 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.069
 and poured a lot of information about the environment 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.890
 a world in which way awesome 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.410
 guessed something native if 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.379
 not Russian remote or eastern 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.810
 Europe so painfully architecture 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.480
 familiar after the second part 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.750
 half-life developers have released two more 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.269
 episodes which of course broke off on 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.980
 the most interesting place will be 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.970
 sometime to half-life 3 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.700
 will we again see the silent physicist 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.130
 can gabe newcomer count up to three yet 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.819
 that all these questions have no answers 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.099
 but we continue to wait and hope 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.019
 the main thing that really was not worse 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:45.120
 than 1 and 2 part 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.120
 and then you know there have been cases
