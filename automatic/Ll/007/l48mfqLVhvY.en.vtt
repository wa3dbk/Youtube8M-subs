00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
two days to figure out how to do it

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.650 
two days to figure out how to do it
although<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.619> been<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> while<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.660> let's

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
although it's been a while now so let's

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
although it's been a while now so let's
see<00:00:18.779> if<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:19.170> remember<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.270> now

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
see if I can remember how to do this now

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.890 
see if I can remember how to do this now
first<00:00:21.570> you'll<00:00:22.140> notice<00:00:22.289> you'll<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.869> have<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
first you'll notice you'll have a have a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.679 
first you'll notice you'll have a have a
little<00:00:25.470> barrel<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.000> push<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
little barrel here you can push here and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
little barrel here you can push here and
you<00:00:27.779> notice<00:00:27.960> nothing<00:00:28.349> happens<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
you notice nothing happens so on the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.370 
you notice nothing happens so on the
other<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.199> should

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
other side this is where it should

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.000 
other side this is where it should
happen<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> small<00:00:33.510> spot<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.649> if

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
happen so there's the small spot here if

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760 
happen so there's the small spot here if
you<00:00:35.219> push<00:00:35.570> you'll<00:00:36.570> notice<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.500> pieces

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you push you'll notice that two pieces

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430 
you push you'll notice that two pieces
will<00:00:38.070> fall<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
will fall out not just one so this is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.610 
will fall out not just one so this is
one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> our<00:00:41.100> keys<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> final<00:00:43.260> key<00:00:43.410> actually

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
one of our keys the final key actually

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
one of our keys the final key actually
and<00:00:44.120> that's<00:00:45.120> two<00:00:45.629> pieces<00:00:46.520> next<00:00:47.520> you'll<00:00:48.030> notice

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and that's two pieces next you'll notice

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.069 
and that's two pieces next you'll notice
that<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.440> piece<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:50.280> fall<00:00:50.460> down<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.079> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that this piece will fall down and you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.130 
that this piece will fall down and you
can<00:00:52.199> slide<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:53.840> like<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:57.140> next

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can slide that out like so and next

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
can slide that out like so and next
you'll<00:00:58.920> notice<00:00:59.280> nothing<00:00:59.579> else<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you'll notice nothing else will want to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889 
you'll notice nothing else will want to
actually<00:01:01.230> fall<00:01:01.379> apart<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.059> trick<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
actually fall apart so trick is as you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
actually fall apart so trick is as you
can<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.760> void<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.600> remove

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
can see there's a void where you remove

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.670 
can see there's a void where you remove
these<00:01:07.229> pieces<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.390> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.350> two

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
these pieces you want to get these two

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
these pieces you want to get these two
and<00:01:10.950> push<00:01:13.130> sometimes<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.580> stiff<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and push sometimes it can be stiff so a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.760 
and push sometimes it can be stiff so a
little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.659> hard<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:15.990> once<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> push<00:01:16.500> you'll

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
little bit hard but once you push you'll

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
little bit hard but once you push you'll
notice<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.720> side<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> fall<00:01:19.650> will

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
notice the other side will fall will

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
notice the other side will fall will
come<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> slide<00:01:22.200> out

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
come out like that now you can slide out

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.749 
come out like that now you can slide out
a<00:01:22.470> similar<00:01:23.009> piece<00:01:23.330> like<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.759> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a similar piece like this one and this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.649 
a similar piece like this one and this
piece<00:01:27.299> will<00:01:27.570> fall<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.409> come<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.920> well

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
piece will fall will come out as well

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
piece will fall will come out as well
and<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.979> after<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.549> you'll<00:01:32.850> find

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and to get in after that you'll find

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
and to get in after that you'll find
this<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.450> slide<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.840> these<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.250> slide

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this will slide out these two will slide

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.390 
this will slide out these two will slide
out<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.110> then<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.740> pieces<00:01:38.659> will<00:01:39.659> come<00:01:39.689> up

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
out and then these pieces will come up

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
out and then these pieces will come up
so<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.460> everything<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.970> fully<00:01:42.180> assembled<00:01:42.600> a
