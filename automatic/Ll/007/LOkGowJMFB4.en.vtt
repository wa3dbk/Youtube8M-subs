00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.680
 okay we'll continue with the reinauer 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.120
 chassis or all the tanks on the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.889
 renault transport tanks are constructed 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.460
 But now I have the predator here 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.260
 took 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.260
 Predator tank &amp; rast skate 2 5 million 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.310
 In fact, the hull is definitely points 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 weaken the armor 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.430
 and on medium until at the latest 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.820
 any case long term view that is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.129
 actually fact so with armor 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.129
 11.11.10 does not last long 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 I refer now to the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.100
 versions of course on the rhine 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 main racer at the predator looks on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 a little different so in the model 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.670
 here 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 He has a front armor of 13 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 because it all back a bit 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 different from the side anyway 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.040
 so i just have to go from here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.939
 hit armor 11 3 rivers and that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 not to mention ops 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:20.880
 of course from the back so gets points 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 really are a big big big one 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 manko in the sixth position was 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.180
 cool so what that does not quite 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 but definitely enough for any case 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 the short-term for the short-term 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.090
 performance is really cool is or is 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 the gimmick the little water 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.240
 Destroyed is a random weapon 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.229
 is selected is rolled out the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 opponent can not get the weapon anymore 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 choose it but with diced 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.710
 that means here in the case of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 The Predator thinks that I do not say 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.909
 as an opponent the laser is gone but it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.150
 this is evaluated and between 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 the laser 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.790
 the heavy forest and everyone 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.610
 serious booty on the side individually if 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.760
 I see that right and a possible one 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.800
 keep storming up here or something 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.240
 head packages so that 's one 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.180
 huge advantage in the demonic 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.210
 not if the politician with a storm bolte 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.670
 and grad rocket the best first 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.280
 does not shoot at all but at most 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.730
 then at the end of the game is a giant 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.840
 is a huge bonus to what now 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.530
 from the impression of again a bit 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.560
 deviates, it is as far as where the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.840
 police armor also another advantage 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 is that that applies to all tanks and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 a stencil generally weapons that of 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.670
 the template prepared by the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.950
 template not only the middle hole 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.080
 strength 10 is everything and though for 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.010
 for infantry anyway but also for 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.260
 other vehicles 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.630
 the this is when I now 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.050
 tank with one all only on 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.820
 would cut then yes is still the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.400
 Tank hit with strength 10 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.350
 that's a huge bonus that I 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.330
 Of course not on the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.580
 renault as such refers to 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.680
 all protected weapons and stencils 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 weapons in general that's really cool 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.239
 can be without robin now to know 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.650
 deviated from the topic 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.570
 But should you should 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.730
 Be aware of it all because of it 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.130
 yes again disadvantage for the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.820
 small tank and what I can say 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.350
 difference leaf angels space marines 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.570
 I found in the fifth edition of the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.760
 difference 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.280
 So really crass remains were angels 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.030
 simply the king what the vehicles 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.780
 At least they 're going to build that up 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.930
 maybe something again then 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.060
 something else 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.299
 how the difference now is if I am that 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.189
 I do not know how cool I think 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:12.540
 because i can handle all vehicles 12 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.880
 drive and I can with one 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.299
 Full throttle still full throttle 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.750
 give 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.330
 i can drive with the sheet angels 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.970
 Of course, in full throttle give it all 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.169
 Berlin only normal full throttle 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.820
 introduction of the rich yet so 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.639
 weapons I can anyway on fire 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.280
 then to emergency just on quick shots 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:44.099
 fast fire 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.770
 rapid fire and yes I do not know yet 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.919
 please write down here 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.770
 in the comments 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.430
 then we can discuss it again 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.940
 And that was my thoughts on the tank 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.280
 on rossis who still has ideas what we 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.810
 You can also discuss below 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.720
 in the comments 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.180
 Thank you and see you next time 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.180
 so well arrives at
