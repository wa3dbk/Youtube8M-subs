00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
card with really low latency this is how

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
card with really low latency this is how
it<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.020> am<00:00:46.230> using<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:46.649> M<00:00:46.800> audio<00:00:47.129> fast
