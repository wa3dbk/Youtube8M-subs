00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.839
 moin moin friends short important info 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.880
 for all hiking friends and there is one 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.690
 new test server you see, among others 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.429
 new interface a few tanks in the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.650
 All in all, that was a few hours 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.380
 models demolished thereby among other things 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 why you because you 7 should not but 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 he actually is the hd model 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 I would therefore have time to turn up the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
 turn up the graphics is definitely the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 hd model 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 you see, looks pretty well done 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 unfortunately not so good because 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 just the graphics settings yet 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.649
 I am low but I leave it as yes 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 told testserver online new armor 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 new interface have already said look 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 let's take a quick look at which armor 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.260
 Among other things, there are new ones during the eight 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.510
 the study e mail it is also stubborn 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 e-mail or was that not the case 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.359
 otherwise panzer is from the fat 5 was called 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 and I e-mail that you stand like that 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.100
 So for 250 long the German is one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 a bit sun stripped le beau 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 I also think it's a lot like driving 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.890
 a slimmed down leo also comes before the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.900
 leo of it all off then is poetry 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 the t 49 has been renamed 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.270
 67 and the new t 49 is just a medium 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 tank with a really funny then 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.320
 But I come to an extra video again 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 Then there were two smaller tanks 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 in the 41 bulldog and the 37 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.630
 they're just on the bottom of the boss 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.619
 to the tea 450 g 1 well then we have 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.549
 even with the Russians new tanks and indeed 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.619
 the lcgb and the t 54 lightweight so 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.659
 say a t 54 to the eight 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 be worse 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 good that just so very very good 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.119
 just for you the info you have 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 ever know what you are next 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.540
 days can do namely test server 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.700
 install and try 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.740
 for those who do not know testserver 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.259
 as I said that server client is normal 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.840
 here goes on world of tanks then 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.300
 publicly in the public test of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.289
 version 9.3 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.440
 there you go and then you have 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 Download the test client below 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.310
 Start stage the download 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 finished in log in with normal 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 your data as well as you 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.380
 Organic tea logs in that can not 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.900
 special new account other 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.400
 just a print finished when logging in 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.940
 your account will be as it is 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 accepted 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.080
 on the testserver and you get 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.410
 plus 100 million credits 100 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.170
 million for xp and 10 15,000 gold in addition 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
 that could be spent at will panzer 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.960
 either try them out 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.750
 Want to see the new walls 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.400
 the flags really want to 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.920
 or if you had deer tank 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.470
 I thought to try it or not 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.420
 I do not know how it drives et 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.240
 Cetera or I want me or the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.050
 For example, when I want to buy russian with me 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.110
 140 430 or tea 62 a buy because of this 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.550
 Just try it here 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.580
 still as you said everything you here 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.230
 changes on the testserver remains on the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.490
 testserver so say if the season 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.500
 is over and the others are gone again 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.780
 ergo buy now as in my case 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 because you 100 and pack yours there 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.940
 WaffentrÃ¤ger cool on innocence yourself 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.489
 for gold around 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.650
 and then few months later , that is 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.690
 testserver away then the crew is back 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.920
 on your weapon carrier 100 and the 100 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.320
 is no longer just base so rather 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.940
 garage so the things bought 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.970
 Say everything on the testserver 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.220
 buys everything in debt 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.530
 undone as an account 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.440
 we have the main account stays the same as him 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.209
 was untouched so much 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.340
 So try to taste Rome at will 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.959
 fight a few tens free 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.570
 Try out a team if your example 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.950
 says the and the panzers obertheres op 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.630
 I have no chance against that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.200
 For example, many people say that 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.630
 bachelors full ok yes bland gadget and see 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.450
 myself as she really is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.060
 I have to say something else if 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.989
 you drive a tank on the test server 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.600
 it is not the same as on the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.800
 liveserver because people want it 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.030
 be sure to test a tank and the 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.100
 drive somehow blunt somehow never 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.739
 with the card three times he purely the 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.420
 The main thing is to shoot something else 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.800
 and that leads partly to you 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.180
 lingering, any tank will be right 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.440
 Damage could happen again 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.480
 for example, with the budget 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.650
 because they could be somewhere behind 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.950
 have time because you like that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.350
 deranged 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.300
 driving is not necessarily like that 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.650
 real comparison but there is 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.650
 At least one feeling you really with im 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.420
 TV comes as well as I will 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.510
 definitely try the new one 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.190
 and make videos on it 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.930
 that's just it for you 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.820
 a short info Hello was tested here 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.010
 what it's made of it makes it 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.030
 fun and feedback certainly could me 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.290
 like the conventions and me myself 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.190
 who of you decided of the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.870
 cover was on the way 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.180
 who still has it and who says so 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.030
 never test what is not so my world I 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.280
 wait until the whole live is so skin 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.090
 Have a nice weekend and see you 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.090
 because then schscher
