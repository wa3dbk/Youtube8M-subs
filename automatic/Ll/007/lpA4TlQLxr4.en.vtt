Photoshop when I say video tutorial set
I<00:00:17.130> mean<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.660> too<00:00:18.900> epic<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.590> keep<00:00:19.830> in

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I mean that it was too epic to keep in

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
I mean that it was too epic to keep in
one<00:00:20.430> video<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.869> I've<00:00:21.960> done<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.199> split<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
one video so what I've done is split it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.880 
one video so what I've done is split it
up<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.160> six<00:00:23.880> parts<00:00:24.090> part<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
up into six parts part one is about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
up into six parts part one is about
clipping<00:00:26.189> masks<00:00:26.670> which<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.090> where<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.810> prepare

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
clipping masks which is where we prepare

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.859 
clipping masks which is where we prepare
the<00:00:29.189> painting<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.789> two<00:00:30.150> different<00:00:30.449> sections

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the painting in two different sections

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220

to<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.560> able<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.890> color<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.279> without<00:00:32.460> any<00:00:33.230> going

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to be able to color in without any going

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
to be able to color in without any going
over<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> lines<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.460> messing<00:00:35.790> up

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
over the lines or you know messing up

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700

nice little method that I kind of used
to<00:01:02.640> paint<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.660> hair<00:01:03.840> texture<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> video<00:01:05.640> 5<00:01:05.850> is

to paint the hair texture and video 5 is
about<00:01:06.090> adding<00:01:06.450> textures<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.260> those<00:01:07.409> clipping

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
about adding textures to those clipping

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
about adding textures to those clipping
masks<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.729> useful<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.930> many

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
masks and this is useful in many

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
masks and this is useful in many
different<00:01:10.439> ways<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.130> drawing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
different ways if you're drawing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.539 
different ways if you're drawing
anything<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.869> Photoshop<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> end

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
anything in Photoshop that in the end

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
anything in Photoshop that in the end
could<00:01:15.060> add<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> detail<00:01:16.140> without<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
could add a lot of detail without you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
could add a lot of detail without you
having<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.909> individually<00:01:18.720> draw<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
having to actually individually draw the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
having to actually individually draw the
text<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.320> yourself<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
text in yourself this is a bit of a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
text in yourself this is a bit of a
cheat<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> works<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
cheat but it's good it works well and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
cheat but it's good it works well and
then<00:01:23.009> finally<00:01:23.549> number<00:01:23.759> 6<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.540> color<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then finally number 6 is about color and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.130 
then finally number 6 is about color and
lighting<00:01:25.320> touch-ups<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:27.450> more<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.020> an

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
lighting touch-ups and that's more of an

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.749 
lighting touch-ups and that's more of an
improvisation<00:01:28.799> process<00:01:29.250> where<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
improvisation process where you kind of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
improvisation process where you kind of
go<00:01:29.880> through<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.689> works<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.079> what

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
go through and see what works see what

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
go through and see what works see what
doesn't<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.860> you'll<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
doesn't and you'll be able to see you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.819 
doesn't and you'll be able to see you
know<00:01:33.479> how<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:34.140> through<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.439> process<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
know how I go through that process and

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.370 
know how I go through that process and
what<00:01:35.100> I've<00:01:35.250> used<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
what I've used when I do that now this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
what I've used when I do that now this
is<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.250> method<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.790> use

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is just kind of one method that I use

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
is just kind of one method that I use
with<00:01:39.270> painting<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> wanted<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> make<00:01:41.040> sure

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
with painting but I wanted to make sure

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.639 
with painting but I wanted to make sure
that<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.700> our<00:01:41.909> attack<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> as

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that I our attack it with you know as

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.149 
that I our attack it with you know as
much<00:01:44.540> detail<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.649> any<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.920> you
