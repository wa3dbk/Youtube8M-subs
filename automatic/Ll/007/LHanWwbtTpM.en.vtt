little<00:02:25.100> tie<00:02:25.430> here<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:27.230> course<00:02:27.500> he<00:02:27.770> has<00:02:27.980> a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
little tie here and of course he has a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.370

green checkered dress vest dress shirt

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.510 
green checkered dress vest dress shirt
and<00:02:34.180> i'm<00:02:35.180> pretty<00:02:35.360> sure<00:02:35.600> he<00:02:35.720> has<00:02:35.900> his<00:02:35.930> tattoo

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
and i'm pretty sure he has his tattoo

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610 
and i'm pretty sure he has his tattoo
that<00:02:37.520> would<00:02:37.790> be<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.120> his<00:02:38.420> arm<00:02:38.750> i<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.470> not

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
that would be on his arm i have not

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.350 
that would be on his arm i have not
looked<00:02:39.890> about<00:02:40.130> pressure<00:02:40.400> he<00:02:40.550> does<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.270> i

looked about pressure he does and i

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.580 
looked about pressure he does and i
think<00:02:41.720> all<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:41.989> these<00:02:42.410> are<00:02:44.110> separate<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.560> I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
think all of these are separate I so I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.400 
think all of these are separate I so I
think<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.010> best<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:47.239> shirt<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> tie<00:02:48.140> are

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
think the best the shirt and the tie are

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.520 
think the best the shirt and the tie are
all<00:02:48.590> separate<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.959> haven't<00:02:51.260> really<00:02:51.380> took

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
