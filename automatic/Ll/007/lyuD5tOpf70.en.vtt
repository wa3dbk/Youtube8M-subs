00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but I noticed that it's been getting

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.179

know<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.789> really<00:01:51.380> started<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.470> slow<00:01:53.069> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
know it was really started off slow you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.169 
know it was really started off slow you
know<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> early<00:01:53.789> really<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.959> early<00:01:55.289> 80s<00:01:56.179> we

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
know in the early really in early 80s we

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.210 
know in the early really in early 80s we
started<00:01:57.599> an<00:01:57.660> 89<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:58.590> weren't<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.039> first

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
started an 89 so we weren't the first

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.820 
started an 89 so we weren't the first
but<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.789> were<00:01:59.819> in<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.330> first<00:02:00.660> wave<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.929> small

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
but we were in the first wave of small

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.919 
but we were in the first wave of small
breweries<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> country<00:02:02.789> that<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:03.780> i

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
breweries in this country that and i

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.419 
breweries in this country that and i
think<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.289> with<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.679> idea<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.009> they

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
think really with the idea that they

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.430 
think really with the idea that they
believed<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.629> of<00:02:06.690> local<00:02:06.989> regional

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
believed in kind of local regional

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.300 
believed in kind of local regional
brewing<00:02:08.360> was<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.629> thing<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:11.160> know<00:02:11.190> in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
brewing was a good thing and you know in

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.780 
brewing was a good thing and you know in
contrast<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.480> big<00:02:13.140> mega<00:02:13.400> national<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
contrast to the big mega national and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.420 
contrast to the big mega national and
international<00:02:15.360> breweries<00:02:15.720> i<00:02:15.989> think<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:17.280> was

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
international breweries i think that was

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.399 
international breweries i think that was
sort<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.700> our<00:02:17.819> idea<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.239> i<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
sort of our idea and i think it's it's

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.839 
sort of our idea and i think it's it's
been<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> good<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.700> all

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
been a good one because you see all

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.610 
been a good one because you see all
these<00:02:20.970> small<00:02:21.209> breweries<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.750> starting<00:02:22.500> up

these small breweries now starting up

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.670 
these small breweries now starting up
all<00:02:22.769> over<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> country<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.319> yeah<00:02:25.319> for

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
all over the country and and yeah for

all over the country and and yeah for
the<00:02:25.739> most<00:02:25.860> part<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.250> there's<00:02:26.459> been<00:02:26.879> some<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the most part but there's been some you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
the most part but there's been some you
know<00:02:28.709> hills<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.700> valleys<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
know hills and valleys in the in the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.380 
know hills and valleys in the in the
growth<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.500> sure<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.940> think<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.150> part

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
growth for sure I think it's just part

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.059 
growth for sure I think it's just part
of<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.569> whole<00:02:33.720> movement<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.409> far<00:02:34.620> probably

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
of a whole movement it's a far probably

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.710 
of a whole movement it's a far probably
a<00:02:35.220> move<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> started<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.090> 70s<00:02:36.269> when

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
a move that started in the 70s when

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.290 
a move that started in the 70s when
winemakers<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.769> starting<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.300> concentrate

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
winemakers are starting to concentrate

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.500 
winemakers are starting to concentrate
on<00:02:39.330> making<00:02:39.599> bigger<00:02:39.989> bolder<00:02:40.379> wines<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
on making bigger bolder wines and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
on making bigger bolder wines and
the<00:02:41.629> growth<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.049> cabernet<00:02:42.439> sauvignon<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the growth of the cabernet sauvignon and

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.479 
the growth of the cabernet sauvignon and
you<00:02:44.030> know<00:02:44.180> weirdo<00:02:44.959> style<00:02:45.260> wines<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.220> same

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
you know weirdo style wines and the same

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.740 
you know weirdo style wines and the same
thing<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.819> happening<00:02:46.849> now<00:02:47.299> in<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> beer

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
thing is happening now in the beer

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.720 
thing is happening now in the beer
industry<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.409> think<00:02:49.010> people<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.400> want<00:02:49.610> to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
industry I think people just want to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.880 
industry I think people just want to
spend<00:02:50.090> their<00:02:50.209> money<00:02:50.420> probably<00:02:51.019> wise<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.470> and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
spend their money probably wise it and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.729 
spend their money probably wise it and
much<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.909> gotta<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.239> one<00:02:53.840> beer<00:02:54.140> instead<00:02:54.560> of

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
much you gotta have one beer instead of

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.500 
much you gotta have one beer instead of
five<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> mean<00:02:55.640> that's<00:02:55.730> that's<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.390> think

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
five I mean that's that's what I think

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.180 
five I mean that's that's what I think
and<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.140> do<00:02:57.319> your<00:02:57.650> quantity

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
and that's what I do your quantity

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.479 
and that's what I do your quantity
versus<00:02:58.549> quality<00:02:58.629> exactly<00:02:59.629> exactly<00:02:59.840> yeah<00:03:00.739> and

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
versus quality exactly exactly yeah and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.009 
versus quality exactly exactly yeah and
I<00:03:01.519> mean<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.390> said<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.810> backwards

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
I mean that I said that backwards

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.930 
I mean that I said that backwards
quality<00:03:03.560> versus<00:03:03.860> one<00:03:04.069> its<00:03:04.250> quality<00:03:04.610> versus

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
quality versus one its quality versus

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.850 
quality versus one its quality versus

and I notice here like you guys are
doing<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.379> lot<00:04:04.860> of<00:04:05.299> automation<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.629> a<00:04:06.659> lot<00:04:06.780> of

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
doing a lot of automation and a lot of

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.789 
doing a lot of automation and a lot of
new<00:04:06.989> technology<00:04:07.709> now<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:09.090> for<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.620> home

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
new technology now but for the home

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.080 
new technology now but for the home
brewer<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.129> mean<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.430> principles<00:04:11.909> are<00:04:12.030> still

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
brewer I mean the principles are still

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.539 
brewer I mean the principles are still
the<00:04:12.390> same<00:04:12.569> yeah<00:04:12.900> yeah<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.200> mean<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.250> reason

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
the same yeah yeah I mean you the reason

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.340 
the same yeah yeah I mean you the reason
why<00:04:14.670> we<00:04:14.879> do<00:04:15.000> automation<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.720> because<00:04:16.109> our

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
why we do automation is because our

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.409 
why we do automation is because our
customers<00:04:17.310> expect<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.970> our<00:04:18.090> beer<00:04:18.299> is

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
customers expect that our beer is

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.930 
customers expect that our beer is
consistent<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.350> we<00:04:20.010> want<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.639> want<00:04:20.669> to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
consistent and we want to we want to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.300 
consistent and we want to we want to
take<00:04:21.180> as<00:04:21.570> much<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> human<00:04:22.560> error<00:04:22.770> out<00:04:22.889> of

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
take as much as the human error out of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.670 
take as much as the human error out of
when<00:04:23.820> we<00:04:23.970> make<00:04:24.150> beer<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:25.020> has<00:04:25.050> really<00:04:25.440> has

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
when we make beer that has really has

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.620 
when we make beer that has really has
nothing<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.490> making<00:04:26.639> good<00:04:26.970> beer<00:04:27.240> you

there's things that you have to do

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.670 
there's things that you have to do
because<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.419> don't<00:04:39.810> have<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.169> setup<00:04:40.410> to

i'm going to buy the ohmmeter measure my
do<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.880> my<00:04:51.479> beer<00:04:51.750> as<00:04:51.930> during<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> process<00:04:52.949> and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
do in my beer as during the process and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.469 
do in my beer as during the process and
I'm<00:04:53.190> going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.370> figure<00:04:53.669> out<00:04:53.820> well<00:04:54.090> how<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.240> I

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
I'm going to figure out well how can I

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.810 
I'm going to figure out well how can I
get<00:04:54.660> this<00:04:54.780> lower<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.949> know<00:04:56.070> it's<00:04:56.370> it's

get this lower so you know it's it's

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.600 
get this lower so you know it's it's
it's<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:57.720> progress<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.620> when<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.130> started

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
it's it's progress and when I started

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.640 
it's it's progress and when I started
here<00:04:59.820> in<00:04:59.940> 99<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.360> know<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:00.810> had<00:05:00.930> one<00:05:00.960> do<00:05:01.289> meter

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
here in 99 you know we had one do meter

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.740 
here in 99 you know we had one do meter
and<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.400> was<00:05:02.520> about<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.210> microscope

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
and that was about it and a microscope

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.230 
and that was about it and a microscope
and<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.650> meantime<00:05:04.889> we<00:05:05.190> have<00:05:05.220> now<00:05:05.490> for<00:05:05.820> quality

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
and the meantime we have now for quality

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.659 
and the meantime we have now for quality
people<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.590> old<00:05:07.710> meters<00:05:08.010> in<00:05:08.160> line<00:05:08.370> and

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
people and the old meters in line and

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.150 
people and the old meters in line and
even<00:05:08.880> stuff<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.800> technology<00:05:10.800> back<00:05:10.979> in

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
even stuff like that technology back in

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.600 
even stuff like that technology back in
the<00:05:11.449> late<00:05:12.449> 80s<00:05:12.479> Early<00:05:13.169> 90s<00:05:13.199> we<00:05:13.770> won<00:05:14.310> couldn't

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
the late 80s Early 90s we won couldn't

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.730 
the late 80s Early 90s we won couldn't
afford<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.180> two<00:05:15.510> we<00:05:16.289> wouldn't<00:05:16.560> have<00:05:16.650> known

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
afford it and two we wouldn't have known

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.890 
afford it and two we wouldn't have known
how<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.919> use<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.310> had<00:05:17.940> had<00:05:18.270> we<00:05:18.419> been<00:05:18.570> able<00:05:18.599> to

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
how to use it had had we been able to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.140 
how to use it had had we been able to
afford<00:05:19.199> it<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:20.190> over<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.520> years<00:05:20.550> as

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
afford it but over the years as

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.890 
afford it but over the years as
technologies<00:05:21.870> gotten<00:05:22.199> cheaper<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.900> know

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
technologies gotten cheaper and you know

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.320 
technologies gotten cheaper and you know
we've<00:05:25.050> hired<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.650> lot<00:05:26.639> of<00:05:26.760> really<00:05:27.000> smart<00:05:27.030> people

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
we've hired a lot of really smart people

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.320 
we've hired a lot of really smart people
to<00:05:27.840> help<00:05:28.110> us<00:05:28.260> manage<00:05:28.860> all<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.430> technology<00:05:30.090> and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
to help us manage all the technology and

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.290 
to help us manage all the technology and
so<00:05:30.570> we've<00:05:30.750> really<00:05:31.020> embraced<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.150> we<00:05:33.150> think

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
so we've really embraced it and we think

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.469 
so we've really embraced it and we think
it<00:05:33.449> makes<00:05:33.630> better<00:05:34.620> beer<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:36.000> just<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.300> matter

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
it makes better beer it's just a matter

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.589 
it makes better beer it's just a matter
of<00:05:36.599> as<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.229> grow<00:05:37.849> don't<00:05:38.849> forget<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.210> you're

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
of as you grow don't forget that you're

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.530 
of as you grow don't forget that you're
making<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.900> quality<00:05:40.110> for<00:05:40.500> you

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
making a quality for you

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.230 
making a quality for you
I<00:05:45.800> think<00:05:46.800> at<00:05:46.920> any<00:05:47.040> given<00:05:47.460> time<00:05:47.640> we<00:05:47.880> might<00:05:48.060> have

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
I think at any given time we might have

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.700 
I think at any given time we might have
about<00:05:48.480> probably<00:05:49.380> 12<00:05:49.820> different<00:05:50.820> beers<00:05:51.560> go<00:05:52.560> on

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
about probably 12 different beers go on

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.070 
about probably 12 different beers go on
any<00:05:52.830> given<00:05:53.040> time<00:05:53.360> but<00:05:54.360> some<00:05:54.540> of<00:05:54.660> them<00:05:54.750> some<00:05:55.020> of

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
any given time but some of them some of

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.050 
any given time but some of them some of
them<00:05:55.200> are<00:05:55.380> big<00:05:55.710> quantities<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:56.520> I'm<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.640> small

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
them are big quantities and I'm a small

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.230 
them are big quantities and I'm a small
really<00:05:57.390> small<00:05:57.770> amounts<00:05:58.770> like<00:05:59.670> greed<00:05:59.940> bear<00:06:00.150> is

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
really small amounts like greed bear is

I think every brewery has an entry-level

I think every brewery has an entry-level
beer<00:06:15.870> I<00:06:16.770> mean<00:06:17.370> in<00:06:17.490> our<00:06:17.640> case<00:06:17.910> it<00:06:18.210> is<00:06:18.360> readers<00:06:19.320> an

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
beer I mean in our case it is readers an

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.320 
beer I mean in our case it is readers an
entry-level<00:06:19.800> beer<00:06:20.220> and<00:06:20.490> there's<00:06:20.880> people<00:06:21.210> out

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
entry-level beer and there's people out

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.970 
entry-level beer and there's people out
there<00:06:21.360> he<00:06:21.660> really<00:06:21.930> do<00:06:22.110> not<00:06:22.290> like<00:06:22.350> we<00:06:22.740> do<00:06:22.950> they

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
there he really do not like we do they

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.350 
there he really do not like we do they
don't<00:06:23.160> like<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.520> taste<00:06:23.700> of<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.000> I<00:06:24.060> don't<00:06:24.240> like

don't like the taste of it I don't like

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.330 
don't like the taste of it I don't like
the<00:06:24.480> graininess<00:06:24.870> in<00:06:25.170> it<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.680> grain<00:06:25.890> flavors

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
the graininess in it the grain flavors

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.950 
the graininess in it the grain flavors
