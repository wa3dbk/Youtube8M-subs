00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.730
 he knows many tones become 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.950

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.720
 90 degree movement 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:26.659

 hips and add hands with arms like 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.079

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.110
 fine so we 'll get right from the start 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.630
 reminds that the beginning 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.600
 We first worked the diaphragm then 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:30.140
 hips then we did in a circle and everything 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:38.480
 5 6 7 7 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 went first 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:43.540
 time two three in a circle 56 shaking and 1 2 3 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.230
 rotate 90 degrees two three and 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.380
 hips in a circle 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.570
 1 2 3 4 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.070
 fine so we learned the most basic 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.110
 rige tone movement you can them 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.330
 use in discos and on any 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.820
 events where you dance you will 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.060
 star of the dance floor before meeting in our 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.060
