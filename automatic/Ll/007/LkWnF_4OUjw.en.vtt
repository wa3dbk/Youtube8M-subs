00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.180
 hello I present you today the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.059
 last born of the osi so lateral ix 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.309
 as you can discover so summer 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.399
 delivered with a rally body 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.050
 ypres opinion so this vehicle is going 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.420
 allow to roll both on land 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.899
 on hermes or on bitumen on any 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.760
 area 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.340
 so what are we going to discover at 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.410
 the inside inside a chassis 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.050
 already well known so everyone 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.079
 it's chassis that was and is delivered 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.780
 with the tenness it was electric or 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.959
 well the tnt in thermal version 1 so 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.899
 extremely experienced there will be no 

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.479
 no unreliability of this chassis 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.670
 since he is from already long 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.799
 date one here so what is it 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.389
 put in outside this chassis you 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.509
 can have an engine like you 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:22.149
 see here from 3900 cab and the engine you 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.909
 can feed it in 2s or 3s 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.310
 lipow that's always in the line 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.950
 of motorizations we will find a 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.209
 variator so that is derived from our 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.219
 range 1/8 reflects so already is enough 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.959
 tough 130 years loses so with the guy 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.759
 of motor that you have on you 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.889
 will have no problem anymore 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.450
 drive accepts until 4s so we will 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:45.599
 can boost the vehicle a little 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.239
 with another motor if desired 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:51.579
 then the great technical innovation of 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.189
 teknologik so on this chassis will get 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.599
 find at the reception level and 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.979
 of the radio then the radio you 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.219
 know it all is entirely 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.020
 compatible how to tell the spectrum and 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.200
 so we have a new system 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.119
 that they are called the avc system that goes 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.009
 allow to stabilize the vehicle 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.780
 especially his acts so what is it 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.430
 calls vehicle access one to the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.160
 direction in this case and then 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.390
 then with this clear separation 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.370
 the vehicle's attitude 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.739
 it's simple a lot more talking 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.049
 rather than in the par libÃ© I will you 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:29.799
 do a little demonstration we go 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:31.930
 turn on the reception set then 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.569
 Usually when you drive 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.269
 so have your your direction and then 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.950
 after a good exit turn is the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.930
 head to tail once assured to things 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.019
 like that it will do what is our 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.640
 host receiver and well he is he 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.329
 contains two gyroscopes inside 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.620
 who will be able to directly restore the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.360
 direction you want to see with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.880
 your vehicle this art that will work 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 see here I move the vehicle and the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.170
 direction without touching the radio where 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 work directly to restore the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.989
 better trajectory than you go 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.860
 take on the flax on a bend in 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.900
 turn exit 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.010
 you are going to have a vehicle clearly 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.290
 easier to fly 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.880
 and then on the other axa do not stay 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.130
 you demonstrate it goes with 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.569
 legal you know well that usually if 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.850
 you take in the air there are two 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.150
 vehicles by ahead or if he wanted 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.010
 not speed back and to the the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 receiver to play its role and that's the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
 keep the car flatter 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.340
 possible on your jumps even at the level 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780
 of the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 years mission but if you have a loss 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.459
 adhesion to the receiver will handle the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.160
 ice cream to get the maximum transmitted 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.870
 his soil and power that's it that's 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.519
 the great technical innovation 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.769
 obviously this system is 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.030
 disengageable or not depending on the pleasure 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.340
 that you want to take to fly it 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.650
 So here you will find out soon 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.040
 store of our land said mr. x 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.420
 hello invites us to discover it so 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.519
 in all our shops that distributes 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.860
 products osi thank you very much 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.319
 I thank you say we will test them a 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.950
 staying for on the wet grass see 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.819
 when it works 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.819
 thank you very much 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.700
 no 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.420
 I'm trying to make slippages but in 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.420
 do their origin 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.639
 he 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.479
 rama 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.479
 I am in Lorient 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.510
