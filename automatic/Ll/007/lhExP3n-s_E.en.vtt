00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 material from the last session I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.560
 getting ready to don mutual let's now 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 create a new item 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.440
 process of making notes a little 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
 unusual therefore especially for 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 beginners created button example click 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.960
 on her and there will be a demonstrative 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.260
 material is a new subject of physics 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.270
 and here is the list of questions pay 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.160
 attention to the braces is 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.079
 separators which separate 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300
 title questions from its content 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.210
 that is, in this case the first question 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.809
 will relativity for what 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.379
 follows its content second question a 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.379
 there and so on 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.439
 in this way you can immediately add 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.439
 any number of questions 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 as you can see the outline can be inserted 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.350
 photograph draw table do 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 links and format text for this 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.580
 there are necessary tools 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.080
 but of course everything can be edited 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.200
 The list is updated in the same way when 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.200
 help curly braces 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.509
 Fill the new question with some kind of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.509
 by material 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 note that when copying 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.040
 text from a Word to format 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.040
 preserved 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.360
 Now you can insert a photo for 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.780
 you first need to upload it to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.780
 server 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.159
 and then puts the page itself 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 it remains only to change the name 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.560
 of the issue 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.180
 save the changes remove the extra question 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.650
 that's all the summary is ready all very 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.650
 simply 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.900
 if you have accumulated too much 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.840
 items do not have to delete old 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.689
 you can create a new semester for 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.370
 go to the section menu item here 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.319
 I have already created two semesters 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.319
 For clarity, let's add a new 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.070
 the semester he created is empty now 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.780
 let's talk about how to do so on 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.870
 give the summary could work immediately 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.990
 several people from different accounts 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.400
 for this very purpose there is a group of 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.710
 I already have one group therefore 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.550
 create new will not be back 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.550
 back to sections 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.060
 for each group which consists 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.070
 create a separate table with the same 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.600
 semester me 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.070
 choose the semester group by default 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:29.780
 we work with the summary on the same 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:31.220
 file manager script you can 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.260
 use not only for download 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.470
 photos but also as a small repository 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.470
 of files 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.870
 I think all the most necessary and told 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.120
