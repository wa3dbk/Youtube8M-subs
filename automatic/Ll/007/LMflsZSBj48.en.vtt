00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.160
 what happened to the announced remodeling 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.040
 of the departmental stadium alfonso lópez 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.840
 pumarejo the city stopped being attractive 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.639
 for events of great importance for 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.890
 blame the deterioration and abandonment of 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.630
 sports scenarios like this report 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 special I am autonomous television 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.320
 for man one would like him to be the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.450
 maximum scenario of a city like 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.900
 bucaramanga really were better 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.850
 conditions for anyone is a secret that 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.260
 has been in recent years I do not speak 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.670
 the last year but of the last 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.730
 years in an almost total abandonment 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.079
 the facilities are very deteriorated 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.180
 the toilet is minimal and therefore as 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.769
 start saying hopefully a city like 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.929
 caravan had a nicer stadium 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.239
 then abandoned stadium to territory 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.610
 from nobody where the indersantander 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.619
 For many years I have been clear about it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.479
 because the inder got the money for 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.920
 do other things and not to get into 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.110
 sports schedule that's why it's so 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.090
 finished was being a fan of the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.100
 bucaramanga is not suitable for fans of the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.110
 atleti bucaramanga that's what I 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.800
 should have at least the stadium 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.530
 alfonso lópez have a good stadium for 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.810
 to be able to contribute with this passion of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.990
 soccer the departmental stadium alfonso 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.600
 Lopez is coated with oxide has a 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.179
 lighting more than deficient the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.149
 silletería is deteriorated the painting 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.799
 lifted and worn there are leaks the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.799
 undergrowth grows on the asphalt of the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.140
 bleachers and slash is a common place 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.240
 to the shame of the santandereanos the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.979
 maximum scenario of the region is 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.770
 find in a deplorable state that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.130
 It bothers and frightens its visitors 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.859
 a terrible darkness there the count 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.320
 dracula dwells and filtration there were 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.610
 can I bathe sometimes when I went and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.009
 I am leaving the stadium and it hit me in 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 bathroom had soap and towel because each 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.390
 Once it rained it flooded that part 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 aero here there is water that has no dignity 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.440
 that undermines human dignity without 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 However, an investment by the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 departmental administration stood up 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.290
 in May of this year the beginning of works 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.769
 of adaptation of the alfonso lópez stadium 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.019
 which was inaugurated in December 1941 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.549
 to acquire Santander the commitment of 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.769
 the realization of the fifth games 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.690
 the 8,000 million nationals are 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.520
 investing we start in the part 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.720
 underground with the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.670
 with the investments of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.320
 waterproofing part of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.850
 parking and now you are going to 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.480
 see that we are going to intervene the bleachers 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.160
 the temporary union works stadium 2013 it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 committed to the governance of 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.080
 Santander to complete the adjustments 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.870
 of the alfonso lópez stadium in February 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.460
 2014 this is the fifth intervention that 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.960
 is done to this sporting scenario 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:57.480
 in its 62 years of life there is a budget 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:01.409
 of 2014 already to intervene 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.420
 other areas of the stadium undoubtedly 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.860
 it's very big and with this first phase 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
 which is the investment that our 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.970
 governor of five billion 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.209
 pesos will not be enough to leave 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.530
 a stadium as we have it in the ideal 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.890
 the santandereanos and this was a little 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.599
 Neglected and needed intervention 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.420
 but they are two situations completely 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.030
 different one is an investment and the other 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.519
 it's a judicial ruling then that's the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.170
 real situation of the stadium of the coliseum 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.970
 vicente díaz and the solid pools 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.590
 but in the midst of the announcements about the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.079
 millionaire investment to start the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.670
 arrangements of this sports scenario 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.410
 failed a popular action against the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.239
 indersantander that manifests the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.340
 violation of the collective interest of 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.540
 disaster prevention security by 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 lack of behavioral studies 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.680
 structural analysis and risk analysis 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.049
 massive influx of public in the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.329
 stadium alfonso lópez reason that led to 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.129
 generate new investments to comply 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.150
 the judicial ruling of a scenario 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.530
 old there is a normativity 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.180
 relatively new in what you have to 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.430
 see with yourself resistance 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.019
 for constructions in this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.599
 normativity is demanding a 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.430
 certification of earthquake and resistance in 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.519
 no part the fault orders closure 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.959
 of the stadium what orders and prohibits the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.759
 massive influx of people to the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.680
 stadium alfonso lópez until it is not 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.800
 do the structural study and loads 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.690
 functional of the stadium although this 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.669
 stage the departmental order and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.380
 administered by Indersantander 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.970
 be located within the municipality of 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.340
 bucaramanga and according to the code 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.630
 national police entity that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.550
 authorizes the massive entrance to 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.910
 shows are these sports 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.560
 musical or otherwise is the mayor's office 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.900
 from bucaramanga and we arrived at a 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.229
 agreement that could be made events 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.889
 but that they will not be massive and the decree 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.919
 38 88 is the one that regulates the events 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.560
 mass at the national level tells us that a 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.940
 massive event is cataloged when the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.160
 system of 1000 people 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.680
 so that's why the bucaramanga could 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.890
 play but with less than 1000 people 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.500
 so that we do not enter contempt 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.400
 of the judicial ruling what has 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.460
 advance is the firm that is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 doing the studies is that it fails 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.139
 structural as such there is no in the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.360
 stadium 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.360
 that is, no faults have been found 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.779
 structural but if that study is going 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.159
 to throw some jobs that you have to 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:40.499
 do in the stadium then we are 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.960
 waiting for the result to be delivered 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:46.379
 of the studies to do these are these 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.300
 reforms that have to be made to 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.849
 stage and we get fired the 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.680
 certification and of course power another 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.780
 have the open stage 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.509
 with events with massive influx of 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.389
 public the government of santander 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:05.630
 directly hired one with a 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.370
 audit to determine and perform 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.520
 the study of structural loads and 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.690
 functional behavior of the stadium 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.870
 equally through the governance of 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.449
 santander being made the 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.780
 adaptation of works from the eastern part 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.509
 the mitigation of works according to the 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.520
 needs presented by the stadium this 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.009
 mitigation of works is being done with 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.050
 the accompaniment of coldeportes and with 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.710
 the football federation in the part 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.360
 electrical adequacy scenarios 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.039
 dressing rooms to meet all the 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.530
 technical normativity that has to have 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.449
 in the stadiums daily they continue 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.250
 training players in this space 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.620
 of the real santander and the athletic 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.810
 bucaramanga who want to be able to feel 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.970
 again the support in the bleachers and 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.919
 fill with Alfonso López 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.539
 scenario that is waiting for you to 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.090
 reflect investments to offer 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.940
 worthy conditions to its users to see 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.670
 I think they have left 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.060
 deteriorate a lot this this scenario 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:07.300
 let's hope that 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.150
 that with the help of the authorities of 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.169
 here in the region can be improved because 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.270
 we need the support of our 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.370
 swollen and and good for what we have 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.730
 understood is not going to be able to fill the 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.730
 stadium
