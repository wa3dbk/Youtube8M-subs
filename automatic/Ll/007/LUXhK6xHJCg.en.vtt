00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
wanted to go over if it'll copy

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
wanted to go over if it'll copy
real<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> guys<00:02:15.390> look<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.840> it

the<00:02:16.260> copy<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.830> game<00:02:16.980> looks<00:02:17.370> really

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the copy of the game looks really

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.920 
the copy of the game looks really
legitimate<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.239> at<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> end<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> day

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
legitimate but at the end of the day

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.350 
legitimate but at the end of the day
anybody<00:02:19.739> can<00:02:19.980> burn<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.430> disc<00:02:20.700> with<00:02:20.790> an<00:02:20.940> image<00:02:21.209> on

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
anybody can burn a disc with an image on

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.760 
anybody can burn a disc with an image on
it<00:02:21.480> literally<00:02:21.870> anybody<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.410> guys<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.739> a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
it literally anybody if you guys have a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.430 
it literally anybody if you guys have a
burner<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.459> guys<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:24.330> literally<00:02:24.840> burn<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
burner you guys can literally burn that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.710 
burner you guys can literally burn that
image<00:02:25.770> onto<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> disk<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.540> game

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
image onto the disk so the this the game

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
image onto the disk so the this the game
could<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.110> fake<00:02:28.319> or<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> could<00:02:28.709> be<00:02:28.739> real<00:02:29.010> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
could be fake or it could be real but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.949 
could be fake or it could be real but
the<00:02:29.489> thing<00:02:29.520> about<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.600> guys<00:02:30.780> look

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the thing about it is if you guys look

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.510 
the thing about it is if you guys look
on<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.620> left<00:02:31.830> side<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> note

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
on this the left side you have a note

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.540 
on this the left side you have a note
now<00:02:33.060> unless<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.140> guy<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.890> plug<00:02:35.069> predict<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
now unless that guy can plug predict the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.820 
now unless that guy can plug predict the
future<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.989> could<00:02:37.260> possibly

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
future I don't think that could possibly

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.470 
future I don't think that could possibly
be<00:02:37.920> even<00:02:38.310> fake<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.580> says<00:02:38.880> day<00:02:39.090> zero<00:02:39.450> edition

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
be even fake it says day zero edition

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.479 
be even fake it says day zero edition
all<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.230> good<00:02:40.380> stuff<00:02:40.410> along<00:02:40.950> with<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.160> print

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
all that good stuff along with the print

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.190 
all that good stuff along with the print
now<00:02:41.880> try<00:02:42.090> zooming<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.080> got

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
now try zooming it in but it just got

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
now try zooming it in but it just got
really<00:02:43.380> pixelated<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.310> me<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.459> read<00:02:44.640> him

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
really pixelated so for me to read him

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
really pixelated so for me to read him
it<00:02:45.000> was<00:02:45.180> very<00:02:45.510> difficult<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> guys<00:02:46.590> can

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it was very difficult so if you guys can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
it was very difficult so if you guys can
read<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.220> link<00:02:47.430> would<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.640> down<00:02:47.850> below<00:02:48.000> but

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
read it a link would be down below but

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.990 
read it a link would be down below but
it<00:02:48.959> looks<00:02:49.260> realistic<00:02:49.769> but<00:02:50.069> as<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.280> said<00:02:50.459> anybody

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
it looks realistic but as I said anybody

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.059 
it looks realistic but as I said anybody
can<00:02:51.269> print<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.780> disk<00:02:51.989> or<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.380> image<00:02:52.530> onto<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.830> disk

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
can print a disk or an image onto a disk

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.559 
can print a disk or an image onto a disk
it's<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.430> easy<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> most

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
it's really easy to do but for the most

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's really easy to do but for the most
part<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.959> thing<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.319> brings<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.680> out<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
part the thing that brings it out the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.830 
part the thing that brings it out the
most<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> fact<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.940> note<00:02:57.269> on<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.630> left

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
most is the fact that note on the left

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110 
most is the fact that note on the left
that<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.440> looks<00:02:58.950> realistic<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.790> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
that this looks realistic that the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.509 
that this looks realistic that the
signature<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.049> zero<00:03:01.410> edition<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
signature is that they zero edition that

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.850 
signature is that they zero edition that
