00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
stores I've got this talk to my head

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.910 
stores I've got this talk to my head
because<00:00:30.779> we're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.590> inside

the grain stores and in tunnels and that
sort<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.899> thing<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> little<00:00:35.910> bit

sort of thing and it's all a little bit
of<00:00:36.090> light<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:43.969> these<00:00:45.710> bins<00:00:46.710> stores<00:00:47.039> again

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989

just come back again probably the game
is<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.549> underneath<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.150> stores<00:01:16.369> see

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
is they get underneath these stores see

scuttling around underneath you see
where<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> rats<00:01:43.619> come<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> rat

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
where the rats come up from the rat

where the rats come up from the rat
borrow<00:01:44.820> their<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.909> ran<00:01:47.909> through<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.390> snow

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
see is distinctive prints there and then

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.370 
see is distinctive prints there and then
up<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> you'll<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.369> off<00:01:57.049> running<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
up and you'll be off running down the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
up and you'll be off running down the
side<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> building<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> that's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
side of the building there so that's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.139 
side of the building there so that's
where<00:02:01.110> our<00:02:01.140> rats<00:02:01.470> moving<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:02.909> actually

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
where our rats moving we can actually

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.580 
where our rats moving we can actually

another hole and it's interested here to
see<00:02:14.100> they're<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.790> these<00:02:14.970> holes<00:02:15.330> are

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
see they're not all of these holes are

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.259 
see they're not all of these holes are
used<00:02:15.870> every<00:02:16.350> day<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:17.970> main

one and then we've got two or three

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.140 
one and then we've got two or three
entrances<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.370> Burrow<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.940> that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
entrances to the Burrow there that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.220 
entrances to the Burrow there that
haven't<00:02:24.360> been<00:02:24.450> used<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.930> there's<00:02:25.080> no

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
haven't been used because there's no

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.509 
haven't been used because there's no
prints<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.800> again<00:02:29.130> we're<00:02:29.340> getting

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
prints there and again we're getting

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.890 
prints there and again we're getting
closer<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> grain<00:02:30.569> store

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
closer to the side of the grain store

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.830 
closer to the side of the grain store
and<00:02:31.170> there's<00:02:31.860> another<00:02:32.069> rat<00:02:32.400> borrow<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:33.030> we

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and there's another rat borrow there we

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.600 
and there's another rat borrow there we
can<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.470> has<00:02:34.680> been<00:02:34.890> used<00:02:34.950> as
