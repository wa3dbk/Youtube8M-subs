really big fingers I don't but if you do
you<00:02:56.390> probably<00:02:56.600> might<00:02:56.810> struggle<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.290> little<00:02:57.440> bit

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
you probably might struggle a little bit

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.400

the flaps not a huge fan of them but the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.740 
the flaps not a huge fan of them but the
