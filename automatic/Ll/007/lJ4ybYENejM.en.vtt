00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:04.439 
to pipe a reverse shell I'm going to use

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.349 
to pipe a reverse shell I'm going to use
a<00:00:04.470> tip<00:00:04.770> number<00:00:04.920> 21<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:05.939> to<00:00:05.970> hold<00:00:06.210> it

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
a tip number 21 and I'm going to hold it

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.710 
a tip number 21 and I'm going to hold it
at<00:00:06.479> a<00:00:06.510> 45-degree<00:00:07.380> angle<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.550> surface<00:00:08.730> it's

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
at a 45-degree angle to the surface it's

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.660 
at a 45-degree angle to the surface it's
kind<00:00:10.020> of<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.260> piping<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.920> regular<00:00:11.400> shell

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
kind of like piping a regular shell

you're going to let the icing build up

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.369 
you're going to let the icing build up
in<00:00:14.160> front<00:00:14.550> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> tip<00:00:15.180> and<00:00:15.390> then<00:00:15.990> instead<00:00:16.320> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in front of the tip and then instead of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.680 
in front of the tip and then instead of
gently<00:00:17.220> releasing<00:00:17.730> pressure<00:00:18.030> as<00:00:18.360> you<00:00:18.390> pull

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

gently releasing pressure as you pull
the<00:00:18.720> tip<00:00:18.930> away<00:00:19.230> you're<00:00:19.860> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> lift<00:00:20.280> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the tip away you're going to lift the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.520 
the tip away you're going to lift the
tip<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> over<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> top<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.260> shell

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
tip up and over the top of the shell

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.050 
tip up and over the top of the shell
kind<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.250> did<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.580> rosette

and<00:00:24.210> then<00:00:24.869> gently<00:00:25.350> release<00:00:25.529> pressure<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.250> you

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
and then gently release pressure as you

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.029 
and then gently release pressure as you
pull<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> tip<00:00:27.060> away<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> want<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:28.890> do

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
pull the tip away and if you want to do

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.340 
pull the tip away and if you want to do
a<00:00:29.070> row<00:00:29.520> of<00:00:29.970> Reverse<00:00:30.480> shells<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.020> makes<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
a row of Reverse shells this makes a

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.040 
a row of Reverse shells this makes a
very<00:00:31.650> pretty<00:00:31.949> scroll<00:00:32.640> type<00:00:33.000> border<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.690> cakes

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
very pretty scroll type border on cakes

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.590 
very pretty scroll type border on cakes
you<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.859> alternate<00:00:35.339> the<00:00:35.550> direction<00:00:35.600> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you just alternate the direction that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
you just alternate the direction that
you<00:00:36.929> turn<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.530> bag<00:00:40.429> here's<00:00:41.429> a<00:00:41.519> slightly

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you turn the bag here's a slightly

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.700 
you turn the bag here's a slightly
different<00:00:42.539> angle<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.229> kind<00:00:43.499> of<00:00:43.530> let

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
different angle you see I kind of let

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
different angle you see I kind of let
the<00:00:43.829> icing<00:00:43.979> build<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.329> instead<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the icing build up and then instead of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
the icing build up and then instead of
pulling<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:47.010> tips<00:00:47.339> straight<00:00:47.699> back<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.179> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
pulling my tips straight back like I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
pulling my tips straight back like I
would<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> regular<00:00:48.749> shell<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.499> lift<00:00:49.769> it<00:00:49.859> up<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
would a regular shell I lift it up and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.029 
would a regular shell I lift it up and
over<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.299> top<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.199> shell<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.649> bit

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
over the top of the shell a little bit

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.069 
over the top of the shell a little bit
like<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.519> rosette<00:00:53.969> kinda<00:00:54.659> like<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> cross

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
like with the rosette kinda like a cross

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.579 
like with the rosette kinda like a cross
between<00:00:55.109> a<00:00:55.739> shell<00:00:56.159> and<00:00:56.459> a<00:00:56.579> rosette<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.589> then

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
between a shell and a rosette and then

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.169 
between a shell and a rosette and then
for<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> reverse<00:00:59.309> shell<00:00:59.639> you're<00:00:59.819> just<00:00:59.999> going

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
for the reverse shell you're just going

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.869 
for the reverse shell you're just going
to<00:01:00.209> alternate<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.619> direction<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.579> pull

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to alternate which direction you pull

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.810 
to alternate which direction you pull
the<00:01:03.030> tip<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.409> shell<00:01:07.520> these<00:01:08.520> do

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the tip up and over the shell these do

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
the tip up and over the shell these do
take<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.480> bit<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.690> practice<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.350> don't

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
take a little bit of practice so don't

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
take a little bit of practice so don't
get<00:01:10.710> discouraged<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:12.690> takes<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> little

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
get discouraged if it takes you a little

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
get discouraged if it takes you a little
while<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> motion<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.600> once

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
while to get the motion down but once

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.110 
while to get the motion down but once
you<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.470> pretty<00:01:16.800> proficient<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.760> making

with the shallow sideways s and then

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.480 
with the shallow sideways s and then
you're<00:01:55.050> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.230> pipe<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> rope<00:01:56.250> you're

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you're going to pipe the rope you're

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
you're going to pipe the rope you're
going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> tuck<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.450> tip<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> crook

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
going to tuck your tip into that crook

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
going to tuck your tip into that crook
there<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.400> then<00:01:59.790> over<00:01:59.970> pipe<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.140> tail<00:02:01.500> from

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
there and then over pipe the tail from

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.090 
there and then over pipe the tail from
the<00:02:02.040> preceding<00:02:02.729> segment<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.600> way<00:02:04.500> when

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the preceding segment and that way when

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
the preceding segment and that way when
you<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.700> towards<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.150> end<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.590> look<00:02:07.800> at

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you get towards the end and you look at

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.030 
you get towards the end and you look at
it<00:02:08.099> head-on<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.700> looks<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> rope

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
it head-on it looks like a rope

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.500 
it head-on it looks like a rope
here's<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.130> slightly<00:02:12.400> different<00:02:12.700> angle<00:02:13.060> more

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
here's a slightly different angle more

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.120 
here's a slightly different angle more
of<00:02:13.570> an<00:02:13.690> aerial<00:02:14.110> view<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.070> a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
of an aerial view you see it's just a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.160 
of an aerial view you see it's just a
little<00:02:15.250> sideways<00:02:15.910> s<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.660> how<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.870> start

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
little sideways s that's how you start

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.410 
little sideways s that's how you start
it<00:02:17.230> off<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.700> trick<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.150> remember

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it off and then the trick is to remember

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.630 
it off and then the trick is to remember
to<00:02:19.570> tuck<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.200> tip<00:02:20.590> into<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> crook<00:02:21.310> there

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to tuck that tip into the crook there

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.990 
to tuck that tip into the crook there
and<00:02:21.880> lift<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.830> over<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.190> tail<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and lift it up and over the tail of the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540 
and lift it up and over the tail of the
proceeding<00:02:25.660> S<00:02:25.870> shape<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.340> gives

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
proceeding S shape and that's what gives

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.550 
proceeding S shape and that's what gives
you<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.790> dimension<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.960> makes<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.380> look

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
you that dimension and it makes it look

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.140 
you that dimension and it makes it look
more<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> rope

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.209
