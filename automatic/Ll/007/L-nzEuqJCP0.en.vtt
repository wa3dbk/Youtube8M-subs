00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you do and it just wastes battery to be

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.350 
you do and it just wastes battery to be
honest<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.739> also<00:04:07.739> Bluetooth<00:04:08.220> if<00:04:08.760> you've<00:04:09.239> got

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
honest and also Bluetooth if you've got

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.449 
honest and also Bluetooth if you've got
a<00:04:09.390> car<00:04:09.690> or<00:04:10.080> whatever<00:04:10.230> we<00:04:10.739> connect<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.280> to

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
a car or whatever we connect you to

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.920 
a car or whatever we connect you to
thing<00:04:11.640> fair<00:04:11.940> enough<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.209> when<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.690> don't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
thing fair enough but when you don't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.479 
thing fair enough but when you don't
when<00:04:13.080> you're<00:04:13.170> not<00:04:13.260> using<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.800> just<00:04:13.860> turn<00:04:14.310> it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
when you're not using it just turn it

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.759 
when you're not using it just turn it
off<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:16.250> yeah<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:19.200> also

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.809 

what<00:04:22.699> I<00:04:22.910> recommend<00:04:23.419> getting<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:24.410> all<00:04:25.039> doing<00:04:25.610> as

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
what I recommend getting is all doing as

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.309 
what I recommend getting is all doing as
well<00:04:26.000> actually<00:04:26.150> if<00:04:26.449> we<00:04:26.569> just<00:04:26.750> go<00:04:26.900> back<00:04:26.930> onto

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
well actually if we just go back onto

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.010 
well actually if we just go back onto
settings<00:04:27.970> now<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.030> could<00:04:29.419> do<00:04:29.509> this<00:04:29.660> do<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.900> in

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
settings now you could do this do it in

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.399 
settings now you could do this do it in
two<00:04:30.229> different<00:04:30.259> ways<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:32.180> first<00:04:32.389> way<00:04:32.599> is<00:04:32.990> if

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
two different ways the first way is if

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.860 
two different ways the first way is if
you<00:04:33.530> just<00:04:33.560> click<00:04:34.340> put<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.330> airplane<00:04:35.840> mode

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
you just click put it on airplane mode

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.610 
you just click put it on airplane mode
and<00:04:36.379> no<00:04:36.770> not<00:04:37.069> for<00:04:37.280> an<00:04:37.340> aeroplane<00:04:38.139> it's<00:04:39.139> just

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
and no not for an aeroplane it's just

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.980 
and no not for an aeroplane it's just
you<00:04:40.580> know<00:04:40.699> say<00:04:40.970> if<00:04:41.030> you're<00:04:41.270> in<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.479> tube<00:04:41.780> where

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
you know say if you're in the tube where

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.200 
you know say if you're in the tube where

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
you know it's probably not best

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.640 
you know it's probably not best
sometimes<00:04:53.990> because<00:04:54.289> you're<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.470> going<00:04:54.590> to

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
sometimes because you're not going to

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
the underground or something that's like

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.129 
the underground or something that's like
a<00:04:59.720> train<00:05:00.110> station<00:05:00.349> in<00:05:00.830> london<00:05:01.009> on<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.639> ground

and there's no signal there never is

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.999 
and there's no signal there never is
then<00:05:05.060> just<00:05:05.270> put<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.479> on<00:05:05.569> there<00:05:05.810> what<00:05:06.530> i<00:05:06.560> do<00:05:06.680> when

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
then just put it on there what i do when

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.100 
then just put it on there what i do when
i'm<00:05:07.159> at<00:05:07.310> work<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.940> because<00:05:08.270> when<00:05:08.509> i'm<00:05:08.780> in<00:05:08.960> this

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
i'm at work is because when i'm in this

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.200 
i'm at work is because when i'm in this
sort<00:05:09.349> of<00:05:09.380> shop<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.099> there's<00:05:10.610> never<00:05:10.849> any

sort of shop and there's never any

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.070 
sort of shop and there's never any
signal<00:05:11.889> I've<00:05:12.889> got<00:05:13.130> this<00:05:13.310> app<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.780> there's

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
signal I've got this app and there's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.990 
signal I've got this app and there's
loads<00:05:15.259> of<00:05:15.349> apps<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.680> do<00:05:15.949> this<00:05:16.219> and<00:05:16.610> they're

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
loads of apps that do this and they're

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.800 
loads of apps that do this and they're
very<00:05:17.110> effective<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.759> so<00:05:19.759> apps<00:05:20.060> saver<00:05:20.389> just

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
very effective and so apps saver just

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.670 
very effective and so apps saver just
put<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.770> battery<00:05:22.599> saver<00:05:23.599> or<00:05:23.960> something<00:05:24.349> into

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
put a battery saver or something into

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.189 
put a battery saver or something into
early<00:05:25.180> Android<00:05:26.180> app<00:05:26.330> store<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.719> you'll<00:05:26.990> find

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
early Android app store and you'll find

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.930 
early Android app store and you'll find
these<00:05:27.409> and<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:27.889> think<00:05:28.219> this<00:05:28.310> will<00:05:28.490> spray<00:05:28.819> the

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
these and I think this will spray the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.189 
these and I think this will spray the
best<00:05:29.150> i'll<00:05:29.449> put<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:29.810> link<00:05:30.050> in<00:05:30.139> the

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
best i'll put the link in the

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.439 
best i'll put the link in the
description<00:05:30.289> for<00:05:31.039> it<00:05:31.250> because<00:05:31.729> what<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.210> can

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
description for it because what you can

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.200 
description for it because what you can
do<00:05:32.719> with<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.110> one<00:05:33.409> is<00:05:33.650> this<00:05:34.550> different<00:05:35.000> one

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
do with this one is this different one

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.959 
do with this one is this different one
so<00:05:35.509> there's<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.870> general<00:05:36.560> intelligent<00:05:37.430> super

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
so there's a general intelligent super

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.899 
so there's a general intelligent super
saver<00:05:38.210> saving<00:05:38.870> mode<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:40.520> know<00:05:40.639> when<00:05:40.819> i'm

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909

saver saving mode and you know when i'm
at<00:05:41.029> work<00:05:41.060> there's<00:05:41.449> nothing<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.110> i<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.380> stick

at work there's nothing and i just stick
it<00:05:42.770> in<00:05:42.860> there<00:05:43.099> so<00:05:43.759> then<00:05:44.000> my<00:05:44.330> phone's<00:05:44.630> not

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870
