00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is I'm actually comparing the white

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.970 
is I'm actually comparing the white
galaxy<00:00:23.100> note<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.150> black<00:00:24.359> galaxy<00:00:24.869> note<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
galaxy note the black galaxy note and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
galaxy note the black galaxy note and
then<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> talk<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.609> how<00:00:27.539> you

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
then we're going to talk about how you

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.120 
then we're going to talk about how you
can<00:00:27.810> actually<00:00:27.930> win<00:00:28.140> both<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.590> devices<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
can actually win both of these devices I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.470 
can actually win both of these devices I
actually<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.550> peel<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> plastic<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
actually just peel the plastic this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
actually just peel the plastic this
thing<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.720> brand-new<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.619> everything<00:00:32.309> right

off of it and then I'm gonna put it back

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.540 
off of it and then I'm gonna put it back
on<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.920> put<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.489> its<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:36.020> so

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
on and put it right back in its box so

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.110 
on and put it right back in its box so
obviously<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.820> ready<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:40.070> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.390 
difference in build design it's exactly
the<00:01:01.199> same<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.370> different<00:01:02.730> color<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:04.400> one

fits in the hand a little stickier a
little<00:02:06.930> better

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:19.059 

and<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:14.530> note<00:02:15.530> 3<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.950> bit

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and the note 3 here is a little bit

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.190 
and the note 3 here is a little bit
different<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:20.560> let's<00:02:21.560> see<00:02:21.739> here<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:23.659> note<00:02:23.840> 3

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
different in let's see here the note 3

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.460 
different in let's see here the note 3
is<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.799> little<00:02:25.040> bit<00:02:25.129> different<00:02:25.579> in<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.930> has<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
is a little bit different in it has a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.360 
is a little bit different in it has a
solid<00:02:28.120> plastic<00:02:29.120> design<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.379> what<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.099> mean<00:02:31.310> by

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
solid plastic design and what I mean by

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.460 
solid plastic design and what I mean by
the<00:02:31.519> plastic<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:32.239> it's<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.750> plastic<00:02:33.079> it's

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
the plastic is it's really plastic it's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.520 
the plastic is it's really plastic it's
not<00:02:33.650> sticky<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.370> texturing<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.299> note<00:02:36.230> 3

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
not sticky or texturing like the note 3

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.729 
not sticky or texturing like the note 3
here<00:02:36.769> from<00:02:37.610> both<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.390> these<00:02:38.569> from<00:02:38.810> 18t<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.709> I

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
here from both of these from 18t so I

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.349 
here from both of these from 18t so I
kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.459> why<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.060> does<00:02:41.540> pick<00:02:41.870> up<00:02:42.129> some<00:02:43.359> smudges

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
kind of why it does pick up some smudges

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.710 
kind of why it does pick up some smudges
and<00:02:44.569> whatnot<00:02:45.190> which<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.459> see<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:46.940> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and whatnot which you can see here it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.910 
and whatnot which you can see here it
just<00:02:47.930> feels<00:02:48.109> better<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> hand<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.859> I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
just feels better in the hand and I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.220 
just feels better in the hand and I
prefer<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.310> black<00:02:49.459> model<00:02:50.090> over<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.079> white

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
prefer the black model over the white

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.819 
prefer the black model over the white
model<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:52.549> that's<00:02:53.299> really<00:02:53.629> it<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.230> far<00:02:54.530> as<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
model so that's really it as far as the

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.520 
model so that's really it as far as the
differences<00:02:55.370> go<00:02:55.609> are<00:02:56.450> basically<00:02:57.019> just<00:02:57.109> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
differences go are basically just the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.460 
differences go are basically just the
colors<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.060> texture<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.720> those<00:02:59.900> materials

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
colors in the texture in those materials

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.839 
colors in the texture in those materials
everything<00:03:00.890> else<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.190> side<00:03:01.400> bevels<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
everything else the side bevels and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.309 
everything else the side bevels and
whatnot<00:03:02.180> are<00:03:02.329> exactly<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> same

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
whatnot are exactly the same

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.220 
whatnot are exactly the same
