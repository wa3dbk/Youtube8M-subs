00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.639
 what it's made of caviar is made of not 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 fertilized eggs of certain species 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.219
 fish for those who love this taste but no way 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.660
 don't swallow it artificially 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.619
 caviar 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 made from seaweed 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.840
 kelp and and not distinguish from the present 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.920
 nor by smell not to taste although there is one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 a big difference 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.309
 price unlike fish caviar and edge 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.890
 seminary is done at the factory so in 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.860
 she has no cholesterol and 0 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.840
 calories 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.969
 this company produces kelp like 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.969
 simple twist game with additives 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 kelp is rich in vitamins and minerals 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 but especially it has a lot of iodine which is good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.969
 for your metabolism is sea 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.829
 plant and it is very different from 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 terrestrial plant content 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 gelatin so it is perfect 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.430
 for the production of small ones 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.619
 elastic balls resembling fish 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.210
 Eggs 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.750
 at the game factory of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.580
 kelp 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 the process begins with the fact that she 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.450
 naturally dried and then 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450
 crushed into powder 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.400
 other ingredients 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.500
 citric acid salt and if it is made with 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.390
 taste and flavorings then they 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.369
 are added when kelp is still in 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:35.220
 natural liquid state all 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.220
 ingredients are added to the water 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.210
 and mix thoroughly with a mixer in 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.600
 one hour before the formation of thick 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.880
 gelatinous fluid 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.920
 that this mixture is transferred to the boiler 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.920
 coupled with an extruder 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 this machine pumps the mixture through 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.650
 device resembling a nozzle of the soul 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.290
 only instead of a continuous water jet 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.630
 tiny copies are squeezed out of it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.360
 kelp balls called pearls 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.900
 in appearance they can not be distinguished from the league 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.660
 kw ok these pearls fall in 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.670
 coating solution he is not only 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.260
 provides them with a soft landing but also 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.950
 helps keep fit 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 pearls 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.100
 pearls roll down the gutter 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.970
 expectantly their containers of which 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.970
 all flows out 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.610
 workers are rolling over the contents 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.610
 containers in big colander 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.840
 then they are washed and filtered to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 all pearls were the same size 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.300
 too small slips through 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.040
 colander hole 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.780
 then the workers weigh out a certain 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.850
 quantity and add to this mass 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.250
 natural stabilizer for 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.880
 maintain texture and round shape 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.880
 these pearls 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.050
 factory quality control department takes 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.300
 sample and from each batch to the sample to 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.210
 make sure that the ph level does not exceed 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.580
 rate strict ph level control and 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.320
 pasteurization is what allows you to save 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.030
 this product without any preservatives on 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.110
 packing area workers fill 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.670
 glass jars 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.480
 and then close each jar 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.510
 tin lids then jars go 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.220
 pasteurization chamber in it caviar 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.930
 heated to a high temperature and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.980
 is here for a certain 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.740
 time period 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.420
 This allows you to kill all the bacteria and such 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.820
 the bank can safely be stored for 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.549
 two years not in the fridge but just on 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.209
 An open bank can be stored on the shelf. 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.710
 three months now in the fridge 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.450
 then a batch number is put on the cover 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.790
 so you can find her later 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.480
 it remains only to wear this jar 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.480
 the label 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.439
 kelp caviar does not contain 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.599
 artificial colors or additives in 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.999
 unlike some types of game she even 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:50.629
 when baking does not paint the next 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:53.300
 products if natural crabs Vaeth 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.849
 only sturgeon if it is black and 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.889
 salmon it and if it is red then caviar from 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.180
 kelp produced with truffle flavor 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.180
 brandy and even wasabi
