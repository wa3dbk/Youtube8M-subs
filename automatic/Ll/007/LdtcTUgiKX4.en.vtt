00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.039
 spring and for that they need a piece 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.320
 of white cabbage a carrot or 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.509
 grated or cut short sticks a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.759
 tender agent cut with a cut 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.279

 of olive having all the ingredients 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.649
 we put a pan on the fire and like 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 We always give you maximum power already 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.760
 we have the hot pan and we add it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 like 3 tablespoons of olive oil the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 vegetable is prepared and what we are going to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.860
 toss is the cabbage 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.500
 and the carrot 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.230
 and we are seeing 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.960
 If you have a ship at home this is a 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.420
 of the best occasions to use 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.090
 remember that the pan is very strong 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.710
 well strong, hot, hot on that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.839
 vegetable has two cooking portions 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.940
 that we are going to give him here and he also has 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.340
 the cooking that we will give you at the time of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 frying the knee we are altering 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 the vegetable for a couple of minutes and 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.160
 Now we throw the rest of the vegetables 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.660
 fry all for another two minutes 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.400
 plus 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.590
 after the other two minutes 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.090
 we add the meat if you see that it lacks 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.399
 a little bit of oil, we add 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.730
 like two other tablespoons bands and 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.240
 fry for two more minutes 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.689
 and we add like a teaspoon of soy 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 there is either a little bit of salt and a 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.530
 little sugar 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.200
 we mix it all a little 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.000
 and we already have them ready we did it in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.680
 we understand a dish well and what 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.540
 we will let cool now let's do 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.310
 a mass that is to teach our 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.710
 rollitos so that it is not open to us 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.430
 at the time of frying here we have a cup 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.220
 with water and here we have Carlos 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.170
 very easy we take the cup and we throw two 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.170
 measures 2 tablespoons water 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.930
 we already take the flour the teaspoon 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 small we are a spoon more or less 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.040
 how are you seeing 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 now we take the pasta brick we put 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.150
 a little sheet of pasta brick we take 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.879
 filling 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.950
 and we're going to throw it to each roll as 2 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.819
 spoonfuls and now what we do is 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.950
 we turn around we upload this part here 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.620
 and with the mass that we have made and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 a brush we paint a little paint 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.490
 over here and good here this what is going to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.980
 to do is to avoid what is reopened 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.980
 come on let's go from here we go back 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.020
 to paint 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.020
 and here what we do is stick here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.450
 we give it here and now and then the same 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.290
 here, then 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.290
 we stick 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.310
 we will see 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.130
 and I 'm afraid 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.569
 and we'll have the first roll and I wanted 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.160

 we already have all the fried rolls and 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.540
 draining and now what we're going to do 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.540
