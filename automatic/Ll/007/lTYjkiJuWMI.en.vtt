 the whole house we painted the walls that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190

 that so famous that we always see 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 in the churches and the circle that does not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.629
 has beginning or end is the signal of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 love of God that eternal really that 's 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.320

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 beautiful who fell in love with God is not 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.940
 never ends 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.760
 that is always in spite of a child 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 despite its complications 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 around all children are born 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.630
 they are born so be it in a taxi in a micro in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.840
 the street life arrives and arrives with 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 force then good is fine then 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.820
 light the little candle to go this way 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.580
 that out there we are presented a little 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.610
 dark that out there we see clouds that 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.640
 how come out good that advent candle is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.160
 to give us mental clarity 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.770
 spiritually so that the good things 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.050
 let's see that everything has a solution while 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.740
 there is life and now this life comes to us 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.060
 to give Christ in this advent this coming 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.439
 everyday 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.200
 how nice and now in the practical 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.320
 in everyday life as we are going 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.539
 working how we can work sometimes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 you can not throw one or two ideas with the 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.350
 guys how to incorporate them 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.600
 to that life as we do 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.240
 we incorporate to live fully this 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.520
 Advent a little bit, the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.770
 story that a pastor who founded a 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.780
 school says that all students 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.230
 days he was asked when Christmas arrives 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.170
 when Christmas arrives it was like that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.410
 longing for when something nice comes 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.690
 then he says that with a car wheel 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 this one filled with twigs and started 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.580
 put candles and said good every candle that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 I understand is going to be that they are not 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.440
 we are approaching Christmas I had it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.930
 to make visible this that out there the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.700
 children did not understand much when they get to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.010
 life is when we say to the mother when 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.290
 my little brother arrives and the mother goes to the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.950
 sister here and start to cross out the days 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 so this is going to make it visible not 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.070
 in a candle 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.380
 this is good light but so that this 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.930
 light be visible at home or more have to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.960
 make an action have a value to take 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.060
 how is to give us more love 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.550
 to have more gestures of proximity 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.920
 towards there those who are not so 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.800
 close to going to make a confession 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.900
 it is more sincere to be seen that the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.910
 we take the hand to the church or that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.220
 simply an image of Christ the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.770
 we really generate with respect 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.480
 and of the virgin then they are gestures 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.610
 concrete that in the lighting house 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.100
 Isabelle say good this candle and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.520
 responsibility are we being 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.400
 those responsible for giving light and life to 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.280
 we first as people and at 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.380
 environment in improving us not to wait 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 that the other better our environment to the 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.390
 light the candle is in us the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.879
 responsibility to illuminate our life 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.110
 and the life of the other 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:01.420
 very practical now we are going to achieve 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.519
 that candle is a commitment that we are 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.970
 Christ says that light be the light of 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.640
 world radiate radiate and as what and 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.159
 Radio good showing that despite 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.239
 all Christ is and that the difficulty 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.169
 what he has given has given us justly 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.810
 tools to be able to get ahead 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.210
 which are the gifts of the holy spirit and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.260
 If we have not received, we have not done the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.430
 confirmation because Christ is there 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.220
 reminding us through this light that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.979
 we turn on I am already there the hope 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.199
 like that green twig that is now in 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.690
 the advent wreath that is green the 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.240
 color of hope and life and while 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.000
 let's have life we have possibilities 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.220
 improve our environment again not 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.370
 wait for another us to improve it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.680
 we are responsible for improving it and 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.080
 what better than with love and not with resentment 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.060
 nor with bad thoughts 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.330
 then I liked this that he proposed 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.310
 as well 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.189
 the director just in the previous 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.050
 coarse warning report 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.569
 we are very used to punishments 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.960
 love I think that is what makes each 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.719
 heart change a little word nothing more 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.139
 for the advent wreath a long time ago 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:19.849
 time a friend of mine gave me that crown 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:25.009
 of advent made of iron 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:27.830
 in a circle with four tubes 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.199
 to put the candles that also officiate 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.499
 like the legs of the crown then 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.959
 When the moment of the wind comes 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.939
 we put four candles and the first Sunday 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:40.039
 we light of course the first candle 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.139
 and it's like I said, you do not go and it's not going 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:46.759
 indicating how much is missing so that 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.860
 so that exactly jesus is born then 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.669
 go down the second on the second Sunday 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.709
 and it's always on the dining table 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.659
 which is what we occupy every day 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.699
 for various tasks if you can be 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.409
 before they can be before or after 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.139
 dinner as we make the blessing 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.479
 good table that is really a gesture of 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.209
 joy we also light the candle 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.639
 already less is left and we have less in 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:13.369
 this way to meet the 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.259
 little boy Jesus then in the children there 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.139
 that also generate this joy of 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.930
 wait 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.090
 this is enthusiasm and I know how to say if 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.039
 light the candle at home because 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.469
 Hence this perhaps can not go to the 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.419
 church something those who are far away 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.849
 they are in the field they are doing their 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.509
 chores do not have perhaps a church 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.279
 close then make that gesture as 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.560
 sign also of blessing the table is 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:41.340
 say the family lighting the home in 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.729
 that moment exactly good daisies 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.469
 thank you very much for these words and for 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.539
 of course we would like to continue talking 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:51.360
 with you on the theme of advent 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.819
 with good we will continue to light the 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.279
 candle so that this road is in 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.520
 dark and we learned the first candle 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:01.229
 good thank you very much a kiss and good that 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.949
 have a nice week thank you very much 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.949
 good bye Good Day
