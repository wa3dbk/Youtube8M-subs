00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
can think of doing this I can think of a

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.140 
can think of doing this I can think of a
very<00:02:58.230> meticulous<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.189> tedious<00:02:59.549> way<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> do<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
very meticulous and tedious way to do it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.330 
very meticulous and tedious way to do it
which<00:03:00.359> would<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.810> take<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.680> five<00:03:02.010> billion

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
which would be to take like five billion

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.729 
which would be to take like five billion
screenshots<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.209> every<00:03:03.840> single<00:03:04.139> skill<00:03:04.469> and

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
screenshots of every single skill and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.009 
screenshots of every single skill and
then<00:03:04.859> go<00:03:05.010> about<00:03:05.159> one<00:03:05.489> by<00:03:05.669> one<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.870> just

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
then go about one by one and it just

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.390 
then go about one by one and it just
wouldn't<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.409> good<00:03:07.620> experience<00:03:07.949> because<00:03:08.129> I

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
wouldn't be a good experience because I

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.550 
wouldn't be a good experience because I
want<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.699> go<00:03:08.819> back<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.389> talk<00:03:09.569> about<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:10.109> you

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
want to go back and talk about this you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.379 
want to go back and talk about this you
know<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.859> just<00:03:10.889> it's<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.030> greatest<00:03:12.150> idea

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
know it just it's not the greatest idea

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.839 
know it just it's not the greatest idea
so<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.049> think<00:03:13.349> I'm<00:03:13.560> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.739> hold<00:03:13.949> off<00:03:14.159> on<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
so I think I'm going to hold off on the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.569 
so I think I'm going to hold off on the
skill<00:03:15.590> explanations<00:03:16.590> until<00:03:16.979> the<00:03:17.099> actual<00:03:17.280> game

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
skill explanations until the actual game

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.849 
skill explanations until the actual game
comes<00:03:18.239> out<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:20.209> yeah<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.449> that's<00:03:21.689> in<00:03:21.989> five

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
comes out so yeah and that's in five

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.949 
comes out so yeah and that's in five
days<00:03:23.189> well<00:03:23.579> less<00:03:23.819> than<00:03:24.030> five<00:03:24.239> days<00:03:24.540> actually

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
days well less than five days actually

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.369
