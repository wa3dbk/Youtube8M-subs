special pin key to pop those out up here

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.210 
special pin key to pop those out up here
on<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> top<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.590> bit<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.890> different

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220

on the top and a bit of a different
placement<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.390> microUSB<00:02:16.780> port<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
the headphone jack

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.849 
the headphone jack
and<00:02:22.329> then<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.599> we<00:02:22.719> move<00:02:22.870> around<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.499> the<00:02:23.680> right

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
and then if we move around to the right

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.949 
and then if we move around to the right
side<00:02:24.189> over<00:02:24.459> here<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.909> can<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:25.269> there's<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
side over here you can see there's the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.050 
side over here you can see there's the
volume<00:02:26.170> rocker<00:02:26.530> above<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.519> power<00:02:27.760> button

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
volume rocker above the power button

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.119 
volume rocker above the power button
this<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.299> bit<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.749> a<00:02:28.810> different<00:02:29.170> arrangement

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
this is a bit of a different arrangement

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.679 
this is a bit of a different arrangement
than<00:02:30.249> we've<00:02:30.400> seen<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.969> the<00:02:31.120> buttons<00:02:31.389> are<00:02:31.450> sort

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
than we've seen and the buttons are sort

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.089 
than we've seen and the buttons are sort
of<00:02:31.749> loose<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.170> flimsy<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:32.889> they're<00:02:33.010> not

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
of loose and flimsy here so they're not

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.239 
of loose and flimsy here so they're not
quite<00:02:33.459> sure<00:02:33.489> how<00:02:34.450> well<00:02:34.629> they'll<00:02:34.780> hold<00:02:34.959> up<00:02:35.249> and

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:36.249 
quite sure how well they'll hold up and

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.129 
quite sure how well they'll hold up and
then<00:02:36.400> around<00:02:36.609> back<00:02:36.849> then<00:02:37.150> we'll<00:02:37.749> look<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
then around back then we'll look and

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:45.540 
then around back then we'll look and
this<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.439> the<00:02:38.590> 13<00:02:39.189> megapixels

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.960 

so<00:02:46.060> that's<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.930> Hisense<00:02:47.650> x1<00:02:48.520> will

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
so that's it this is the Hisense x1 will

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.580 
so that's it this is the Hisense x1 will
be<00:02:49.060> known<00:02:49.210> as<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> sliver<00:02:49.780> x1<00:02:50.320> when<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
be known as the sliver x1 when it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.440 
be known as the sliver x1 when it
launches<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.160> US<00:02:51.400> Joseph<00:02:52.210> with<00:02:52.330> an
