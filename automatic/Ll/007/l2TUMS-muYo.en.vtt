another regular zombie but he looks sort

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.580 
another regular zombie but he looks sort
of<00:01:21.370> armored<00:01:21.790> he's<00:01:22.240> holding<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.810> human<00:01:23.290> head

of armored he's holding a human head
with<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.830> gas<00:01:24.280> mask<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:25.900> pretty

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
with a gas mask on it that is pretty

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.080 
with a gas mask on it that is pretty
nasty<00:01:26.770> right<00:01:26.980> there<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.460> that's<00:01:27.760> interesting

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
nasty right there so that's interesting

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.710 
nasty right there so that's interesting
in<00:01:28.510> my<00:01:28.540> opinion<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.520> another<00:01:30.820> really<00:01:31.150> key

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
in my opinion but another really key

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.010 
in my opinion but another really key
thing<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.200> notice<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.890> these<00:01:33.310> blue<00:01:33.790> look<00:01:34.780> they

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
thing to notice is these blue look they

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.270 
thing to notice is these blue look they
Billy<00:01:35.230> that<00:01:35.470> they<00:01:35.560> look<00:01:35.740> like<00:01:35.890> blue-eyed

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
Billy that they look like blue-eyed

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.740 
Billy that they look like blue-eyed
zombies<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> background<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.480> just<00:01:37.660> see

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
zombies in the background you just see

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.990 
zombies in the background you just see
blue<00:01:38.470> lights<00:01:38.800> if<00:01:39.250> those<00:01:39.610> are<00:01:39.760> indeed

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
blue lights if those are indeed

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760 
blue lights if those are indeed
blue-eyed<00:01:40.390> zombies<00:01:40.870> what<00:01:41.110> does<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.440> mean

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
blue-eyed zombies what does that mean

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.380 
blue-eyed zombies what does that mean
well<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.130> means<00:01:42.340> there's<00:01:42.610> zombies<00:01:42.880> under

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
well that means there's zombies under

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.360 
well that means there's zombies under
ripped<00:01:43.630> off<00:01:43.780> ins<00:01:43.960> control<00:01:44.440> which<00:01:44.650> makes<00:01:44.920> zero

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
ripped off ins control which makes zero

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.730 
ripped off ins control which makes zero
sense<00:01:45.460> because<00:01:46.180> Richthofen<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.260> actually<00:01:47.680> in

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
sense because Richthofen is actually in

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.500 
sense because Richthofen is actually in
the<00:01:47.830> map<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.190> not<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.490> control<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.090> zombies

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the map and not in control the zombies

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.030 
the map and not in control the zombies
so<00:01:50.200> maybe<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:51.010> is<00:01:51.190> some<00:01:51.520> sort<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.030> like<00:01:53.040> third

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
so maybe this is some sort of like third

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.370 
so maybe this is some sort of like third
dimension<00:01:54.970> or<00:01:55.450> not<00:01:55.659> there<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:55.990> mention<00:01:56.260> like

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
dimension or not there to mention like

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.649 
dimension or not there to mention like
fourth<00:01:56.650> dimension<00:01:57.370> battle<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.420> on<00:01:58.600> between

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
fourth dimension battle going on between

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.420 
fourth dimension battle going on between
Maxis<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.290> ripped<00:01:59.470> often<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.130> got<00:02:00.310> to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
Maxis and ripped often and we got to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.370 
Maxis and ripped often and we got to
sort<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.820> out<00:02:00.880> there<00:02:01.630> fighting<00:02:01.960> for<00:02:02.290> control

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
sort that out there fighting for control

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.440 
sort that out there fighting for control
still<00:02:03.130> maybe<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.760> has<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.090> do<00:02:04.180> with<00:02:04.300> Easter

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
still maybe that has to do with Easter

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.320 
still maybe that has to do with Easter
egg<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.260> what<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.500> actually<00:02:05.890> think<00:02:06.370> is<00:02:06.640> going

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
egg but what I actually think is going

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.479 
egg but what I actually think is going
to<00:02:07.510> be<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.960> huge<00:02:08.560> part<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.069> Easter<00:02:09.399> Egg

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
to be a huge part of the Easter Egg

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.220 
to be a huge part of the Easter Egg
where<00:02:09.670> it's<00:02:09.849> gonna<00:02:10.030> actually<00:02:10.269> start<00:02:10.539> on<00:02:11.080> this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
where it's gonna actually start on this

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.710 
where it's gonna actually start on this
map<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.950> area<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.849> map<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.239> you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
map is this area of the map if you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.349 
map is this area of the map if you
notice<00:02:14.140> they<00:02:14.530> are<00:02:14.560> underground<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.180> in

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
notice they are underground they are in

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.259 
notice they are underground they are in
a<00:02:16.540> tomb<00:02:16.930> there's<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.829> tomb<00:02:18.189> right<00:02:18.609> on<00:02:18.939> to<00:02:19.150> the

like ancient Egyptian

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.820 
like ancient Egyptian

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
remember in the map description they

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.480

said<00:02:28.330> Nazi<00:02:29.080> archaeologists<00:02:30.010> unearthed

life-altering I don't remember the words
but<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.070> thought<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:37.120> zombies<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.750> first

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
but I thought that was zombies at first

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.040 
but I thought that was zombies at first
but<00:02:38.320> clearly<00:02:39.010> they<00:02:39.850> unearthed<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.600> tomb

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.610 
but clearly they unearthed this tomb
they<00:02:41.290> found<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.800> tomb<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:43.080> had<00:02:44.080> something<00:02:44.440> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
they found a tomb that had something to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.260 
they found a tomb that had something to
do<00:02:44.890> with<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> zombies<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> zombies

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
do with the zombies in the zombies

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.640 
do with the zombies in the zombies
storyline<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.720> we'll<00:02:47.020> have<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> wait<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.620> find

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650

out<00:02:48.040> about<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.520> but<00:02:48.730> that's<00:02:48.850> what<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.030> think

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
out about that but that's what I think
