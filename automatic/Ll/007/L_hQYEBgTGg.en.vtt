00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.400
 Dusseldorf is a city with two 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.250
 There are the faces of one side 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.519
 spruced up in the city of these years 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.310
 where will millions be invested 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.740
 plots of land per person 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.840
 luxury apartments arise and on the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.039
 other side is the neighborhoods in 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.970
 for many years nothing more 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.119
 has happened 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.160
 they are not hung on growth 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.379
 where the city participates 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.110
 public places 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.930
 the schools in one 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.280
 are deplorable condition 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.600
 I would like to change that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 the balance restored 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.120
 becomes between inner city and districts 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.829
 i do not want all the money on it 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.140
 a half square kilometer in the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.760
 city ​​is spent but that just 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.129
 also the quality of life 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.260
 stay quality in the districts 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.300
 the people are increasing again 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.610
 have left feeling here in the district 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.710
 to live there you like to stay there 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.839
 You can go shopping there you can go out 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.039
 he also finds social and 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.320
 cultural life instead 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.880
 that's important to me and that's why 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.750
 I said from the beginning now are the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.340
 districts turn 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.350
 we have to split the city 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 we must avoid it again 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 ensure that social cohesion and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.709
 the cohesion between city and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.709
 district is restored 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 I've been to many times in recent months 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.270
 garath gaal is a district with 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.210
 a huge potential 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.090
 it's green there's a lot 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.610
 lively association and needs for life 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.780
 but in the district itself many are many 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.780
 nothing happened 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.210
 in the southwest the former still 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.120
 in addition to the center south west, there is much to 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.790
 there is a church that has a lot of vacancy 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
 on given there are also apartments 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.600
 the probably many old people the on 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.910
 No barrier-free apartments here must 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.630
 what are they actually based on this 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.440
 be revitalized again 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.150
 be restructured it is correct 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.950
 After 50 years, this district 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.959
 to look and maybe even there 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.700
 an urban development competition too 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.990
 make it look like you're in it otherwise 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.800
 actually only in the düsseldorf 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.930
 Downtown 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.940
 and I also think that this 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.300
 Processes go fast is that you look 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.860
 just with the same zeal with it 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.020
 with the same ambition for one 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.150
 district like carla but also hassels 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.400
 for example ascot against the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.130
 potsdamer street that you are with the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.200
 same ambition with the same 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.450
 moderate use should contain so in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.950
 districts such as around the arch 2 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.870
 where it has succeeded within just 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.700
 times five and a half weeks a whole 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.709
 development plans become these 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.510
 speed this attention 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.690
 I also wish for our city 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.459
 I was at the spring bush with a 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.010
 initiative called living with 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.019
 to entertain children 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.030
 we are very dedicated families 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.510
 develop a neighborhood together 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.900
 want 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.049
 that is actually a new one 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.239
 innovative form affordable housing too 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.120
 build and I find this project 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.680
 should not only be accompanied by the city 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.480
 The city is supposed to interest 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.060
 because you have to move forward quickly 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.370
 we can come apartments for 5000 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.750
 humans arise it is pathetic like 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.209
 long discussed this topic already 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.000
 and how little does that happen then 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.470
 This thing needed shove that is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.690
 in the interest of the city and of course 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.270
 also love the affected company 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.160
 düsseldorferin end düsseldorfer the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.130
 we come sunday the day of the stitch election 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.440
 is an important day for düsseldorf us 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.050
 We can do the turn 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.910
 bring you to more affordable housing 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.669
 towards more investment in the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.630
 parts of the city towards a modern one 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.590
 mobility policy with emphasis on 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.180
 bus train and bike and go to one 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.919
 future-oriented policy in 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.530
 education in schools and care 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.360
 investing in it is important for you 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.280
 all go to the polls at the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.139
 participation in a vote if it ultimately matters 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.510
 if we can make the change 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.190
 therefore my please go to yourself 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.289
 but you also speak with your choice 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.570
 neighbors with their friends with theirs 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.979
 known with their work colleagues 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.340
 Remember the election call 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.720
 Ask her to go to the polls and me 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.979

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.039
