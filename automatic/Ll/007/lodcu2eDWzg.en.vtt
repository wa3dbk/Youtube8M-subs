00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 power from the discharge do it yourself from that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.040
 that there is an amplifier on the an-70 microcircuit 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 173 to taken from car radio 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.939
 here is a piece of board with a radiator from 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.279
 the recorders are directly integrated circuits and 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.830
 necessary elements for wiring 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:31.189
 capacitor and resistor this is powered 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.189
 12 volt power supply amplifier 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 1.3 amps only gives out plus 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 parallel to the power capacitor for five 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.219
 thousand microfarad 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 twenty five volts also for any 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.300
 self-made amplifier need a regulator 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.120
 loudness is not necessarily a tumbler treatment 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 treats and main connection sockets 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.579
 this is the input output and for the network cable 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 which in the outlet can also be done 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.250
 nest but I soldered a solid wire 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.210
 normal tulip entrance entrance from unnecessary 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 home appliances output is better to make a form 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 terminal clamps for easy connection 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.780
 any column if you do 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 stereo amplifier 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.470
 then you need two nests accordingly 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 times more than two outputs and two inputs 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.950
 at least the body can be made of what 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.049
 anything that has a presence 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.570
 I concocted this enclosure for a quick 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.759
 half an hour from thick hardboard which 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.950
 lying in the garage grabbing the walls and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.329
 glue gun 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 to have everything in one box 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.630
 arranged at first I tried to do 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:53.340
 nodule on the chip there 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 2050 nose on polar food she 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.670
 produced very little power output a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 2 polar did not want to do because 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.770
 power supply would take up a lot of space 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 of course one could do 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.670
 bipolar power but here you would 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.090
 healthy transformer like all this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.900
 box with a single power supply for a long time, I 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.640
 wisely connected the power supply to 32 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 volt and such is still on big 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.730
 volume distortions appeared game 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.930
 the circuit work fine and no video I'm 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.690
 even the second same solder 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.530
 that's all as circuit wiring 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.760
 the Internet has a datasheet to connect but 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.599
 where so I managed to do it 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.870
 on the chip 20 to 2050 voltage 220 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.870
 current is supplied through a switching jungle 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.859
 switching power supply on one 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.519
 transistor output 12 volts goes to 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.580
 capacitor 5 thousand microfarad soviet 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.080
 to 5016 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.300
 from it is already going to keep track of the microcircuit 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.530
 An-70 173 to 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.280
 seems to be a stereo booster 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.960
 14 watts output per channel 3 4 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.870
 tomash 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.790
 when powered 12 volt input 1 channel i 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.930
 shorting out 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.170
 condenser model second channel 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.270
 used without any modifications 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.480
 the layout on the board is all 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.100
 necessary elements are present 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.840
 the sound source is fed to the standard 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.340
 nest version that is a tulip through 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.650
 coaxial wire is fed to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:49.350
 volume control from it new 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.090
 amplifier and output to a speaker as well, 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.760
 subwoofer which I showed recently 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.500
 I saw Lachin close in a day from unnecessary 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.500
 pieces of chipboard in this way 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.830
 by the way here's my back wall 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:43.640
 closed and in the resulting space i 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.280
 Sintepona can be written by another 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.620
 boosting material read it on 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.190
 frequency somewhere 4043 hertz 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.520
 but he mumbles up to 25 where with you 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.500
 seen on video and now i will show 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.260
 speaker from which I want to do 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.780
 The next sub-buffer is such 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.800
 the Soviet unit from it was already done 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.770
 top buffer 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.780
 Soviet knot 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.780
 he has a very large diffuser stroke 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.770
 resonance frequency 40 hertz 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:26.300
 i think of a quarter wave resonator with 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:30.949
 he will be good here 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.970
 speaker throw out sorry for him nothing 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.970
 get off with it 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.650
 especially in size about the same 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.500
 like 12-inch 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.169
 ordinary speaker that is for the place of him 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.220
 it will be possible to deliver 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:51.470
 12 inch any other speaker 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:54.349
 the holes coincide in diameter to whom 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.680
 interesting with trained on this dynamics 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.770
 put likes subscribe to the channel of all 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.770
 kind
