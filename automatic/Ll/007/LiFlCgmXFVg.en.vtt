 Cocoa is a tree that originated in the 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.059
 Amazon is an American by routes 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.009
 commercials that kept the different 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.610
 Aboriginal civilizations spread 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.439
 to the south of Mexico in 1528 he entered 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.960
 Europe through a shipment that 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.550
 HernÃ¡n Cortez arrived in Spain from 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.130
 cocoa seeds you get a 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.980
 solid matter the cocoa mass and a 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.629
 fat , cocoa butter and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.970
 mix them with sugar can be elaborated 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.739
 different types of chocolate that 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.629
 depend on the proportion between these 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.739
 elements and the combination with others 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.580
 products like milk and nuts 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.199
 Colombia is one of the countries 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.909
 South American that presents a greater 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.729
 growth in the industry of 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.500
 chocolate factory innovation has allowed 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.900
 the development of new goods or 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.210
 chocolate products 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.100
 making the stuffed chocolate what 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.960
 least we want to do is have the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.800
 necessary tools for your 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.020
 metal spatula realization 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.270
 mold containers 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 thermometer oven microwave a refrigerator 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.870
 bitter chocolate and peanut butter are the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.620
 ingredients of the delicious chocolates 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.360
 fillings 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.520
 the chocolate is split into small 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 fragments to then take it to the oven 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.640
 at 45 degrees and in this way they are founded 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.400
 the crystals of cocoa butter 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 we went through a very very nice process 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 pretty striking process that is the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.710
 process of tempering tempering is to lower 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.450
 the temperature of the chocolate this 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.170
 process serves to brighten the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 delicious chocolates 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.900
 after we have the chocolate 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.990
 tempered we clean the mold very well 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.390
 with cotton and the dryer and proceed to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.900
 place our tempered chocolate in 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.900
 mold 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.009
 after this it vibrates very well for 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.539
 jump the air bubbles so that 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.800
 our support is perfect that 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.840
 proceed in truth this movement 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.370
 it produces the breaking of the crystals that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.650
 they are growing in smaller pieces 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.690
 with what increases their number how are they going 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.310
 forming and breaking more crystals the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.940
 viscosity of liquid chocolate for 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.940
 increase it 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.620
 when we have it ready we turn the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.300
 mold and we remove the excess chocolate 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.340
 so that our mold that as a 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.340
 little thing to be able to enter the filling 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 it is brought to refrigeration for 20 minutes 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.060
 time the crystals grow 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.530
 quickly and the chocolate solidifies 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.530
 to be able to apply the filling 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.030
 often we have to do the same 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.190
 process back melt at 45 degrees 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.530
 centigrade 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.600
 return to temper when we have 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.800
 tempered we take out our mold and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.610
 we cover the glass already with our filling 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.870
 inserted 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.640
 again it is brought to refrigeration 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.500
 20 minutes to solidify 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.740
 when it has solidified from a single 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.260
 hit for more effectiveness we take the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.260
 chocolate and we proceed to draw 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.690
 The chocolate shop in Colombia has 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.849
 strengthened thanks to the knowledge and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.170
 innovation than apprentices and instructors 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.170
 they print to the processes 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.630
 and in this way our 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.560
 chocolate filling ready 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.560
 to enjoy
