need to go okay well here see this is
this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:19.609> Maxwell<00:00:20.609> thing<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.480> front<00:00:21.779> thing

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this is my Maxwell thing my front thing

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.519 
this is my Maxwell thing my front thing
see<00:00:23.039> there's<00:00:23.189> nothing<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:24.320> get<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
see there's nothing on there get the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.779 
see there's nothing on there get the
find<00:00:26.180> where<00:00:27.920> let's<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.039> her<00:00:29.130> power<00:00:29.400> button

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
find where let's see her power button

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.400 
find where let's see her power button
broke<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> start<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.260> your

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
broke and you need to start with your

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
broke and you need to start with your
fear<00:00:36.770> yeah<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.100> computer<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.700> broke

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
fear yeah but my computer actually broke

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.930 
fear yeah but my computer actually broke
its<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> power<00:00:40.050> supply<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:41.190> broken<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
its the power supply that's broken it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.139 
its the power supply that's broken it
still<00:00:42.360> runs<00:00:42.600> though<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.320> doesn't<00:00:43.770> run

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
still runs though it doesn't run

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
still runs though it doesn't run
anything<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.899> isn't<00:00:46.170> running<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.620> my

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
anything like it isn't running in my

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
anything like it isn't running in my
screens<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.280> anything<00:00:48.170> yeah

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
screens or anything yeah

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.450 
screens or anything yeah
so<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.980> cable<00:00:50.340> right<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:52.680> actually

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so this cable right here it's actually

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.110 
so this cable right here it's actually
labeled<00:00:54.620> p2<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.610> broken

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
labeled p2 that's broken

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.740 
labeled p2 that's broken
so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> doesn't<00:00:57.960> start<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> find

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so I doesn't start so you have to find

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.149 
so I doesn't start so you have to find
the<00:01:01.760> should<00:01:02.760> say<00:01:02.969> power<00:01:03.439> SW<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.739> might<00:01:05.010> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the should say power SW it might be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.100 
the should say power SW it might be
different<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.549> years<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.510> pretty<00:01:06.930> sure

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
different for years but I'm pretty sure

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.410 
different for years but I'm pretty sure
it<00:01:07.290> says<00:01:07.590> power<00:01:07.920> SW<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:11.150> right<00:01:12.150> there

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it says power SW right here right there

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.950 
it says power SW right here right there
this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> power<00:01:13.409> rest<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this is power rest of you so you have to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
this is power rest of you so you have to
find<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.350> plugs<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> every

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
find where that plugs in and every

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.330 
find where that plugs in and every
motherboard<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.900> different<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> will

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
motherboard is different so that will

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
motherboard is different so that will
green<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:21.030> light<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
green little light right down there is a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.219 
green little light right down there is a
it's<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:24.930> take

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's on so you have to pretty much take

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.149 
it's on so you have to pretty much take
a<00:01:26.509> let's<00:01:27.509> say<00:01:28.159> let's<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.430> where's<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.180> thing

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
a let's say let's see where's my thing

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
a let's say let's see where's my thing
it's<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.630> say<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.079> safe<00:01:34.380> or

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's I'm not gonna say it's safe or

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's I'm not gonna say it's safe or
anything<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.369> I've<00:01:35.670> tried<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
anything because I've tried it but it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
anything because I've tried it but it
doesn't<00:01:36.990> shock<00:01:37.200> me<00:01:37.259> anything<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> guess

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
doesn't shock me anything so I guess

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.069 
doesn't shock me anything so I guess
your<00:01:39.119> driver<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.909> pretty<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.630> find

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
your driver very and pretty much find

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.819 
your driver very and pretty much find
where<00:01:43.470> those<00:01:43.649> pins<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.250> oh<00:01:44.460> crap<00:01:44.759> sorry

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
where those pins are oh crap sorry

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
where those pins are oh crap sorry
find<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> pins<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.549> minor<00:01:48.540> right<00:01:50.000> there<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
find the pins are minor right there so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
find the pins are minor right there so
I'm<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.229> gonna<00:01:52.500> touch<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:53.970> much

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I'm just gonna touch it I'm pretty much

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.330 
I'm just gonna touch it I'm pretty much
gonna<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:55.079> grab<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> base<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
gonna just grab the base of it like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
gonna just grab the base of it like
pretty<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.560> then

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

pretty much just right there and then
just<00:01:59.070> touch<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> middle

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
just touch it pretty much in the middle

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
just touch it pretty much in the middle
it<00:02:01.500> should<00:02:01.740> start<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.840> see<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.250> it's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it should start up see so much it's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.669 
it should start up see so much it's
really<00:02:05.520> bad<00:02:05.700> lighting<00:02:06.000> but

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.670 

see<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.130> starts<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.720> started<00:02:13.200> by<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
see it starts up and I started by the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
see it starts up and I started by the
fan<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.090> hopefully<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.660> hear

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
fan is going and hopefully you can hear

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.690 
fan is going and hopefully you can hear
that<00:02:16.670> see<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.050> yeah<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.800> started<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that see so yeah it started up and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.510 
that see so yeah it started up and
that's<00:02:21.599> how<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.870> jump<00:02:22.140> started<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> computer

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's how you jump started a computer

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.260 
that's how you jump started a computer
and<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.630> I'm<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.739> gonna<00:02:25.890> say<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
and it's I'm not gonna say it's a if it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.420 
and it's I'm not gonna say it's a if it
could<00:02:27.780> screw<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.260> motherboard<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.040> don't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
could screw up my motherboard I don't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.420 
could screw up my motherboard I don't
know<00:02:29.690> exactly<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> risks<00:02:31.860> are<00:02:32.069> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
know exactly what the risks are you

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.190 
it and I'll show you my actual power
button<00:02:54.090> works<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.019> wait<00:02:55.110> until

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.650 

I'm<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.280> plugging<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.640> back<00:02:59.670> in<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.390> then

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I'm just plugging it back in and then

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.240 
I'm just plugging it back in and then

plugging the power SW my button sort of

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.110 
plugging the power SW my button sort of
out<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.819> it's<00:03:06.030> rigged<00:03:06.209> right<00:03:07.010> here<00:03:08.120> right

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.160 

yeah<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.269> my<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.980> power<00:03:17.400> unit

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
yeah I know my it's the power unit

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.750 
yeah I know my it's the power unit
because<00:03:20.060> that's<00:03:21.060> broken<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:22.970> when<00:03:23.970> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
because that's broken because when I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.900 
because that's broken because when I
when<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.790> downloaded<00:03:27.890> or<00:03:28.890> when<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.220> start<00:03:29.640> up<00:03:29.790> my

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
when I downloaded or when I start up my

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.479 
when I downloaded or when I start up my
computer<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.840> used<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.260> fan<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.340> a

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
computer and I used this fan like it's a

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.099 
computer and I used this fan like it's a
cool<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:33.030> fans<00:03:33.299> for<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> CPU<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:35.280> um<00:03:36.109> this

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
cool down fans for the CPU it's um this

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.470 
cool down fans for the CPU it's um this
is<00:03:37.320> from<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> original<00:03:38.130> computer<00:03:38.579> too<00:03:39.060> so

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
is from the original computer too so

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.990 
is from the original computer too so
it's<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.680> stock<00:03:41.010> computer<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.670> it's

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
it's like the stock computer and it's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.009 
it's like the stock computer and it's
been<00:03:42.180> really<00:03:42.570> really<00:03:42.780> old<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:45.019> actually

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
been really really old so I actually

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.710 
been really really old so I actually
plugged<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.829> he<00:03:46.890> hasn't<00:03:47.070> started<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
plugged this in and he hasn't started it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.780 
plugged this in and he hasn't started it
doesn't<00:03:48.720> even<00:03:48.840> spin<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.260> off<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
doesn't even spin it off so it's the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.270 
doesn't even spin it off so it's the
power<00:03:51.000> unit<00:03:51.600> that's<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:52.319> under<00:03:52.650> powering<00:03:53.130> it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
power unit that's like under powering it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.970 
power unit that's like under powering it
and<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.420> don't<00:03:54.600> if<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.590> so

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and if you don't if you don't think so

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.099 
and if you don't if you don't think so

is like even if I hold it in it doesn't

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.180 
is like even if I hold it in it doesn't
turn<00:04:18.579> off<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.180> usually<00:04:19.600> does<00:04:19.870> but<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:21.010> not

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190

turning off so see I'm holding it in

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.490 
turning off so see I'm holding it in
usually<00:04:27.010> shuts<00:04:27.310> right<00:04:27.520> off<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:32.080> yeah<00:04:32.229> there's
