it<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> bit<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:29.720> bring<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> over<00:02:31.349> like<00:02:31.500> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.370 

okay<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.550> sorry<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:39.450> tag<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.870> still<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.110> it

as<00:02:44.400> well<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.600> just<00:02:46.290> tuck<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.709> edges<00:02:46.860> under

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
as well so just tuck the edges under

00:02:48.650 --> 00:03:04.490 
as well so just tuck the edges under
somewhere<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.610> make<00:02:56.850> sure<00:02:57.090> that<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:04.049> like

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that and then this end we are going to

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.090 
that and then this end we are going to
do<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.430> also<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:10.519> tuck<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.819> under<00:03:12.390> somewhere

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
do is also to tuck it under somewhere

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.130 
do is also to tuck it under somewhere
very<00:03:14.100> neatly<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.569> edges<00:03:15.930> are<00:03:16.049> not

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
very neatly so that the edges are not

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.740 
very neatly so that the edges are not
showing<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.100> make<00:03:17.580> sure<00:03:17.610> if<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.480> this

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
where it's longer try to make it even a

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.380 
where it's longer try to make it even a
bit<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:23.900> tuck<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.049> under<00:03:25.380> somewhere

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390
