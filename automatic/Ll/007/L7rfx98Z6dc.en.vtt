and when you're up against two insane AI
on<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> map<00:00:33.630> they're<00:00:34.380> pretty<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
on this map they're pretty much at the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.090 
on this map they're pretty much at the
opposite<00:00:35.489> side<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.480> map<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> very<00:00:37.440> bottom

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
opposite side of the map the very bottom

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.139 
opposite side of the map the very bottom
left<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.210> their<00:00:39.780> side<00:00:40.079> by<00:00:40.320> side<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
left on their side by side so what you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700 
left on their side by side so what you
want<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> send<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.050> work<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.500> worker

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
want to do is send your work one worker

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.639 
want to do is send your work one worker
down<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.420> continue<00:00:45.420> collecting<00:00:46.050> minerals

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
down there continue collecting minerals

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.750 
down there continue collecting minerals
here<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:48.739> basically<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.219> eat<00:00:50.309> enough<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
here and basically and eat enough you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260 
here and basically and eat enough you
you<00:00:50.969> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> pile<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:52.670> close<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.000> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you want to put a pile on as close to in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
you want to put a pile on as close to in
between<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.350> bases<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.860> possible<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
between the two bases as possible this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
between the two bases as possible this
is<00:00:56.699> pretty<00:00:57.030> much<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.360> close<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.870> get

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is pretty much as close as you can get

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.020 
is pretty much as close as you can get
so<00:00:58.980> he's<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> go<00:00:59.520> over<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so he's just going to go over here and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.770 
so he's just going to go over here and
check<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.039> bases<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.120> taryn

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
check out the bases so we got one taryn

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
check out the bases so we got one taryn
and<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.350> Protoss<00:01:04.979> base<00:01:07.340> hey<00:01:08.340> workers<00:01:08.729> how's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and one Protoss base hey workers how's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
and one Protoss base hey workers how's
it<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.390> collect<00:01:09.810> those<00:01:09.930> minerals<00:01:10.380> because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it going collect those minerals because

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
it going collect those minerals because
you're<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> die<00:01:11.490> alright<00:01:12.420> soon<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you're about to die alright soon as the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.620 
you're about to die alright soon as the
pylons<00:01:13.320> built<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> got<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> build<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> forge

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
pylons built you got to build a forge

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
pylons built you got to build a forge
I've<00:01:15.630> never<00:01:15.780> played<00:01:16.020> Protoss<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:17.130> pretty

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
I've never played Protoss so I'm pretty

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
I've never played Protoss so I'm pretty
much<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> new<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.890> by<00:01:19.890> assume<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> pylon

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
much a new with this by assume the pylon

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
much a new with this by assume the pylon
allows<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> build<00:01:21.420> structures<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
allows you to build structures in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.039 
allows you to build structures in the
certain<00:01:22.920> radius<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> pylon<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.840> need

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
certain radius of the pylon and you need

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.010 
certain radius of the pylon and you need
a<00:01:25.080> forge<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.740> order<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> build<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:29.189> cannons

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
a forge in order to build the cannons

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.569 
a forge in order to build the cannons
and<00:01:31.020> apparently<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.490> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and apparently you need like I'm not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
and apparently you need like I'm not
sure<00:01:32.790> why<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> need<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> build<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> forge

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sure why you need to build the forge

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.530 
sure why you need to build the forge
here<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.409> opposed<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.189> main<00:01:35.369> base<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
here as opposed to your main base but

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
here as opposed to your main base but
you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> forage<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you have to have a forage up here and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
you have to have a forage up here and
then<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.240> soon<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> forge<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> built<00:01:40.200> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
then as soon as the forge is built you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.569 
then as soon as the forge is built you
can<00:01:40.650> build<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.890> cans<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
can build your cans you're going to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
can build your cans you're going to
build<00:01:41.700> them<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.299> behind<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.079> mineral

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
build them right behind the mineral

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.389 
build them right behind the mineral
patches<00:01:44.360> within<00:01:45.360> reach<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> their<00:01:46.020> workers<00:01:46.399> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
patches within reach of their workers of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.350 
patches within reach of their workers of
all<00:01:47.549> their<00:01:47.759> workers<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.420> their

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
all their workers and their

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.900 
all their workers and their
command<00:01:49.690> centers<00:01:50.200> or<00:01:51.070> main<00:01:51.370> vases<00:01:51.880> or

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
command centers or main vases or

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.390 
command centers or main vases or
whatever<00:01:52.240> they're<00:01:52.360> called<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.960> race<00:01:53.400> and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
whatever they're called in the race and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.510 
whatever they're called in the race and
that's<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.820> one<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:55.150> each<00:01:55.300> side<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:57.280> think

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
that's it one on each side and I think

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.950 
that's it one on each side and I think

winning time and second place was one

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.330 
winning time and second place was one
seconds<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.990> had<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.200> submission<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.860> was<00:02:20.980> one

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
seconds we had a submission that was one

seconds we had a submission that was one
second<00:02:22.180> behind<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.890> winning<00:02:24.370> time<00:02:24.670> right

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
second behind this winning time right

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.810 
second behind this winning time right
here<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.620> cannons<00:02:27.070> basically<00:02:27.700> are

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
here so the cannons basically are

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.100 
here so the cannons basically are
attacking<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.300> workers<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.140> bases<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
attacking the workers and the bases and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.310 
attacking the workers and the bases and
the<00:02:32.110> AI<00:02:32.350> doesn't<00:02:33.160> attack<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:34.360> anything<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
the AI doesn't attack do anything and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.550 
the AI doesn't attack do anything and
basically<00:02:36.540> they'll<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.780> end<00:02:37.989> up<00:02:38.170> giving<00:02:38.350> up

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
basically they'll just end up giving up

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.199 
basically they'll just end up giving up
the<00:02:38.680> beam<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.070> there<00:02:39.190> they<00:02:39.280> Oh<00:02:39.310> give<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.910> click

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
the beam and there they Oh give up click

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.050 
the beam and there they Oh give up click
click<00:02:40.450> yes<00:02:40.720> yes<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:42.040> winning<00:02:42.280> time<00:02:42.730> is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
click yes yes and the winning time is

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.460 
click yes yes and the winning time is
three<00:02:43.510> minutes<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.080> 24<00:02:44.830> seconds<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:46.470> that's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
three minutes and 24 seconds so that's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.100 
three minutes and 24 seconds so that's
the<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:48.459> cannon<00:02:48.820> rush<00:02:49.060> with<00:02:49.270> protoss<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the the cannon rush with protoss and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.850 
the the cannon rush with protoss and
like<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.220> said<00:02:51.280> second<00:02:52.030> place<00:02:52.060> was<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:53.140> second

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
like I said second place was one second

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.240 
like I said second place was one second
behind<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:55.799> now<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.890> person<00:02:57.160> who

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
behind that so now the person who

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.289 
behind that so now the person who
submitted<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.640> video<00:02:57.910> doesn't<00:02:58.120> actually
