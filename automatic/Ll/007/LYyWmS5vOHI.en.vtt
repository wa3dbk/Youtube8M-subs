 the next food delivery point 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.490
 it is true the plantings is and it was placed we work here with the people if the term 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.509
 because it's a different concept 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.149
 the different concept is in the whole structure in the service in the furnace 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.539
 because in addition to galleries as the venue because place 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.830
 However, it does not isolate the bank 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.560
 on the top floor then it will give you theme services are not outside the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.980
 discounted products 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.790
 we have done in other popa and domínguez this also martínez julia por 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.690
 of course because in addition to those who have the voice we are communicating the elements 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.200
 logo but also follow in essence from that of the product in this case 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.040
 I came to know retirement with computer not 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.929
 and this would not suffer seven months min 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:01.909
 i a ruin 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.309
 you can not get the colors to mafias have entered what you have to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.110
 watch 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.830
 if there was a place 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.610
 with our clients, part of advertising 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 what I will not be able to fly highlighted the aleph what operated 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.260
 what happens is that 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.570
 We have talked about flyers as a common element that companies use to sell 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 only use to communicate 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.210
 but there is another element that time becomes more common 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.520
 and that does not cost much either 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.000
 and that is quite modern 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 we are talking about the internet 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.560
 bassi replacing had langer 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.299
 oezil and llorente a flyer having the internet in time and the more 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.659
 people are connected 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.210
 it's going to be another alternative 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.240
 and as I say competent economic and paste in modernity but also what 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 good thing about the internet is that so it's interactive nonsense the steering wheel yet 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.900
 a client who will read there will go or not go 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.420
 in the case of the internet he will see the light the power of suddenly asking you 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 feels vertigo 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 review 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.049
 you can get used to it may already be a period 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.390
 and in time 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 but people have the feeling of fidelity advertising on the internet 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.079
 the social zetas companies 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.729
 Well what happens is that advertising on the internet is only part of what 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.139
 that the company can be on the internet 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.129
 because before being a police officer after selling online 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.759
 and before you can even meet your customer or nearby with customers 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.649
 through the internet with a voice of none for example since the internet is 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.679
 more than much more positions is something only an internal part so start 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.629
 well know you can learn then develop your product 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.079
 like how did Poles tell you that in the future because against for example is 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.390
 a shop in a day meneses sanchez 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.769
 because there with a desire for casualties were pesantez just looking 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.500
 if you want you can move company, then entertain 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.730
 many still list many names or many products abroad because 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.789
 clear a bear is published with the media télam vision is surprising 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.200
 the bet as 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.429
 the bet of this list 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.889
 if the dad the mall 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:58.879

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.049
