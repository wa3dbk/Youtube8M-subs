been around for a long time
I<00:00:09.540> remember<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> British<00:00:10.380> cars<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.269> early

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
I remember the British cars of the early

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.919 
I remember the British cars of the early
50s<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.840> 40s<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.440> had<00:00:13.769> knockoffs<00:00:14.929> Porsche

50s and 40s have had knockoffs Porsche
has<00:00:16.170> designed<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.830> very<00:00:17.160> nice<00:00:17.520> system<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
has designed a very nice system that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.679 
has designed a very nice system that
uses<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.289> center<00:00:20.039> lock<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.850> also<00:00:21.029> has<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> special

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
uses a center lock it also has a special

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
washer loosening up and sometimes they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350 
washer loosening up and sometimes they
were<00:01:30.509> locking<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.020> place<00:01:31.140> properly<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:33.060> torque

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
were locking in place properly we torque

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.039 
were locking in place properly we torque
these<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.280> 450<00:01:35.280> foot<00:01:36.150> pounds<00:01:36.570> which<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
these all to 450 foot pounds which is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.530 
these all to 450 foot pounds which is
approximately<00:01:37.320> 550<00:01:38.299> Newton<00:01:39.299> meters<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
approximately 550 Newton meters of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
approximately 550 Newton meters of
torque<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.229> seems<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> me<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> good<00:01:40.979> torque<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
torque that seems to me a good torque to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.390 
torque that seems to me a good torque to
allow<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.899> wheels<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.200> stay<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.009> not

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
allow the wheels to stay on and not

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.310 
allow the wheels to stay on and not
shut<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.300> Porsche<00:01:45.540> Center<00:01:45.870> locks<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.290> on

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shut up the Porsche Center locks are on

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280 
shut up the Porsche Center locks are on
with<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.760> force<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.630> usually<00:01:49.110> have

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
with a lot of force so we usually have

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.900 
with a lot of force so we usually have
someone<00:01:49.530> sit<00:01:50.010> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.160> car<00:01:50.340> put<00:01:50.550> their<00:01:50.700> foot<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
someone sit in the car put their foot on

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.790 
someone sit in the car put their foot on
the<00:01:50.970> brake<00:01:51.270> while<00:01:51.960> someone<00:01:52.290> loosens<00:01:52.620> up<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
the brake while someone loosens up the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:58.110 
the brake while someone loosens up the
center<00:01:53.130> lock

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.420 

so<00:02:58.690> here<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.050> can<00:02:59.170> see<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.830> inner<00:03:00.160> part

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
so here we can see that the inner part

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.729 
so here we can see that the inner part
of<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.580> center<00:03:00.819> lock<00:03:00.970> threads<00:03:01.599> thread<00:03:02.500> into

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
of the center lock threads thread into

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.339 
of the center lock threads thread into
the<00:03:03.010> inner<00:03:03.700> part<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> hub<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.930> again<00:03:05.200> this

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
the inner part of the hub and again this

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.170 
the inner part of the hub and again this
is<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.739> locking<00:03:06.370> mechanism<00:03:07.140> which<00:03:09.180> prevents

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
is the locking mechanism which prevents

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.930 
is the locking mechanism which prevents

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.490 
Porsche tortured race cars and all race
cars<00:03:18.370> did<00:03:19.030> not<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.629> locking<00:03:19.989> mechanism

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
cars did not have this locking mechanism

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.140 
cars did not have this locking mechanism
but<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.069> this<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.730> something<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
but this is this is something the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.210 
but this is this is something the
factory<00:03:22.569> felt<00:03:22.810> was<00:03:23.049> an<00:03:23.650> important<00:03:24.040> thing<00:03:24.129> to

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
factory felt was an important thing to

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.000 
factory felt was an important thing to
do<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.760> minimize<00:03:25.569> any<00:03:26.260> problems<00:03:26.739> associated

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
do to minimize any problems associated

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.100 
do to minimize any problems associated
with<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.489> general<00:03:27.790> public<00:03:27.959> installing<00:03:28.959> their

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
with the general public installing their

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.809 
with the general public installing their
own<00:03:29.200> wheels<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.920> possibly<00:03:30.310> having<00:03:30.519> the

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
own wheels and possibly having the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.819 
own wheels and possibly having the
wheels<00:03:31.209> come<00:03:31.420> loose<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.290> see<00:03:35.590> when<00:03:35.739> we

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
wheels come loose as you see when we

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.750 
wheels come loose as you see when we
turn<00:03:36.010> this<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:38.130> start<00:03:39.130> getting<00:03:39.400> into<00:03:39.640> that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
turn this on start getting into that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.390 
turn this on start getting into that
locking<00:03:40.150> mechanism<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.989> fact<00:03:41.260> its<00:03:41.470> lock<00:03:41.920> lock

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
locking mechanism in fact its lock lock

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.610 
locking mechanism in fact its lock lock
now<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.450> tool<00:03:44.519> has<00:03:45.519> an<00:03:45.730> internal<00:03:46.120> piece

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
now so the tool has an internal piece

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.910 
now so the tool has an internal piece
which<00:03:47.620> pushes<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.489> lock<00:03:48.640> mechanism<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.329> which

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
which pushes the lock mechanism in which

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.910 
which pushes the lock mechanism in which
allows<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.250> wheel<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> lock<00:03:52.930> nut<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.620> spin

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
allows the wheel to a lock nut to spin

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.069 
allows the wheel to a lock nut to spin
and<00:03:54.519> tighten<00:03:54.970> against<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.360> wheel<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.870> achieve

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
and tighten against the wheel to achieve

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.660 
and tighten against the wheel to achieve
its<00:03:56.230> torque<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:57.010> once<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.340> torque<00:03:57.549> is

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
its torque and once the torque is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.000 
its torque and once the torque is
achieved<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.900> make<00:03:59.049> sure<00:03:59.230> this<00:03:59.379> is<00:03:59.590> this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
achieved and to make sure this is this

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.890 
achieved and to make sure this is this
comes<00:04:00.280> out<00:04:00.459> this<00:04:00.940> kind<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.299> gets<00:04:01.420> stuck<00:04:01.750> in

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
comes out this kind of gets stuck in

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.620 
comes out this kind of gets stuck in
there<00:04:02.190> not<00:04:03.190> very<00:04:03.220> easily<00:04:03.549> but<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.970> can<00:04:04.150> kind<00:04:04.600> of

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
there not very easily but it can kind of

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.620 
there not very easily but it can kind of
come<00:04:04.889> flush<00:04:05.889> with<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.190> surface<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:07.600> is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
come flush with the surface what is

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:17.060 
come flush with the surface what is
properly<00:04:08.019> engaged<00:04:11.370> lock<00:04:14.340> I'm<00:04:15.340> light

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
properly engaged lock I'm light

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.490 
properly engaged lock I'm light
ah

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.090 

100<00:04:22.500> foot<00:04:22.680> pounds<00:04:22.910> 450<00:04:23.910> good
