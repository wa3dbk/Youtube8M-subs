plugs and stuff at that office I've

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
plugs and stuff at that office I've
cleaned<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> before<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.009> them<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.250> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
cleaned it before I put them here but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.160 
cleaned it before I put them here but
yeah<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.470> quite<00:01:52.680> thin<00:01:52.979> hoop<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.659> looks

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
yeah it's quite thin hoop but it looks

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.030 
yeah it's quite thin hoop but it looks
like<00:01:56.960> some<00:01:57.960> people's<00:01:58.229> tastes<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.649> lower<00:01:58.829> than

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
like some people's tastes and lower than

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
like some people's tastes and lower than
that<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.850> quite<00:02:00.030> high<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that my was quite high up because my

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.649 
that my was quite high up because my
ears<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.899> quite<00:02:00.960> small<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.799> tell<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
ears are quite small as you can tell so

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.969 
ears are quite small as you can tell so
it's<00:02:03.659> quite<00:02:03.780> hidden<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it's quite hidden but I kind of like it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's quite hidden but I kind of like it
like<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> few

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like that and I think it was a few

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.249 
like that and I think it was a few
people<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.750> obvious<00:02:07.140> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
people it was a bit about obvious so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.389 
people it was a bit about obvious so
that's<00:02:07.380> why<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> changed<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> hoop<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.220> did

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that's why I changed to a hoop I did

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
that's why I changed to a hoop I did
have<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.610> curved<00:02:09.300> barbell<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.989> before<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
have a curved barbell in it before this

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.330 
have a curved barbell in it before this
is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.369 
is
well<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.300> pierced<00:02:12.660> women<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.019> it's<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
well I got pierced women and it's a

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.020 
well I got pierced women and it's a
little<00:02:13.620> bit<00:02:13.860> thicker<00:02:14.129> than<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.580> ring<00:02:14.910> I've

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
little bit thicker than the ring I've

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
little bit thicker than the ring I've
got<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.269> now<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> little<00:02:16.200> bit<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:17.190> I'm

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
got in now just a little bit so I'm

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.530 
got in now just a little bit so I'm
hoping<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.700> gonna<00:02:17.910> shrink<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.269> too

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
hoping it's not gonna shrink down too

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
hoping it's not gonna shrink down too
much<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> does<00:02:20.280> some<00:02:20.580> pretty<00:02:20.849> sharp

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
much but if it does some pretty sharp

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.880 
much but if it does some pretty sharp
points<00:02:21.450> still<00:02:21.629> be<00:02:21.720> able<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> get<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.230> back

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
points still be able to get this back

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
points still be able to get this back
even<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.400> wanted<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> bar<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> got<00:02:24.239> pierce

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
even if I wanted to bar I got pierce

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.449 
even if I wanted to bar I got pierce
with<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:26.090> titanium<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.069> I've<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.310> at

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
with is titanium and the one I've got at

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.550 
with is titanium and the one I've got at
the<00:02:29.489> moment<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:30.030> surgical<00:02:30.750> steel<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.349> just

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the moment is surgical steel so just

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.110 
the moment is surgical steel so just
make<00:02:31.680> sure<00:02:31.799> you're<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:31.920> allergic<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.940> any<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
make sure you're not allergic to any of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.690 
make sure you're not allergic to any of
the<00:02:33.330> metal<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.200> put<00:02:34.500> into<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.799> oh<00:02:35.220> I've

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the metal that you put into it oh I've

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.789 
the metal that you put into it oh I've
had<00:02:35.879> my<00:02:36.120> days<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> piercing<00:02:36.989> around<00:02:37.379> five

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
had my days of piercing around five

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.619 
had my days of piercing around five
months<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.280> kind<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> fully<00:02:39.299> healed<00:02:39.510> I

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
months now I kind of fully healed I

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.030 
months now I kind of fully healed I
think<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.080> probably<00:02:40.170> needs<00:02:40.470> more<00:02:40.530> moments

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
think it probably needs more moments

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.619 
think it probably needs more moments
fully<00:02:41.430> fully<00:02:41.580> healed<00:02:41.879> because<00:02:42.120> when<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.269> press

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
fully fully healed because when I press

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.640 
fully fully healed because when I press
on<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:44.060> still<00:02:45.060> feels<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.390> little<00:02:45.599> bit<00:02:45.900> little

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
on it it still feels a little bit little

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.440 
on it it still feels a little bit little
bit<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.069> tiny<00:02:47.700> little<00:02:47.880> bit<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.180> I've<00:02:48.299> changed

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
bit and tiny little bit but I've changed

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.100 
bit and tiny little bit but I've changed
obviously<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.200> not<00:02:50.780> losing<00:02:51.780> or<00:02:51.989> anything

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
obviously so it's not losing or anything

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.460 
obviously so it's not losing or anything
like<00:02:52.260> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
like that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.339 
like that
performance<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.579> was<00:02:54.299> okay<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.569> change<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
performance it was okay to change the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.630 
performance it was okay to change the
piercing<00:02:55.680> usually<00:02:55.799> says<00:02:56.040> two<00:02:56.220> months<00:02:56.489> after

with my tragus piercing of changing it

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.509 
with my tragus piercing of changing it
too<00:03:05.940> early<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.480> do<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:07.470> really<00:03:07.980> hurts

was<00:04:52.280> worse<00:04:52.580> than<00:04:52.910> getting<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.330> piercing<00:04:53.660> done

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
wasn't that bad really really wasn't

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.100

about washed it with a salt water
solution<00:05:09.320> I<00:05:10.010> only<00:05:10.190> did<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.430> once<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.570> day<00:05:11.600> the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
solution I only did it once a day the

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.010 
solution I only did it once a day the
person<00:05:12.200> who<00:05:12.500> says<00:05:12.680> twice<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:12.950> day<00:05:13.280> but<00:05:14.210> for<00:05:14.600> me<00:05:14.780> I

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
person who says twice a day but for me I

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.050 
person who says twice a day but for me I
don't<00:05:15.289> think<00:05:15.500> it's<00:05:15.889> really<00:05:16.370> necessary<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.940> do

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
don't think it's really necessary to do

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.700 
don't think it's really necessary to do
it<00:05:17.150> -<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.330> stayed<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.870> think<00:05:18.200> Carter's<00:05:18.530> pair

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
it - I stayed I think Carter's pair

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.830 
it - I stayed I think Carter's pair
things<00:05:18.950> can<00:05:19.130> get<00:05:19.250> more<00:05:19.430> irritant<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.150> swollen

yes<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:37.100> don't<00:05:37.220> know<00:05:37.280> else<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.550> say<00:05:37.729> out<00:05:37.849> the

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
yes I don't know else to say out the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.700 
yes I don't know else to say out the
piercing<00:05:43.450> left<00:05:44.450> for<00:05:44.599> quite<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.870> long<00:05:45.110> time<00:05:45.380> I

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
piercing left for quite a long time I

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.010 
piercing left for quite a long time I
think<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.729> due<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.180> fact<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.389> my<00:05:47.840> the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
think it was due to the fact that my the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.050 
think it was due to the fact that my the
bar<00:05:48.380> came<00:05:48.620> out<00:05:48.740> like<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:48.919> said<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.729> was

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
bar came out like I said and it was

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.909 
bar came out like I said and it was
plasma<00:05:50.750> for<00:05:50.990> quite<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:51.169> long<00:05:51.229> time<00:05:51.289> as<00:05:51.530> well<00:05:51.680> but

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
plasma for quite a long time as well but

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.290 
plasma for quite a long time as well but
and<00:05:52.130> that's<00:05:52.310> totally<00:05:52.580> normal<00:05:52.700> for<00:05:52.910> it<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.090> use

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
and that's totally normal for it to use

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.510 
and that's totally normal for it to use
plasma<00:05:53.660> babies<00:05:54.139> you<00:05:54.380> know<00:05:54.470> gunky<00:05:55.070> obviously

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
plasma babies you know gunky obviously

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.279 
plasma babies you know gunky obviously
it<00:05:55.580> might<00:05:55.700> be<00:05:55.789> effective<00:05:56.210> but<00:05:56.360> mine

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
it might be effective but mine
