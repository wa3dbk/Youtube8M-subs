00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.930
 two-thirds of our planet's surface are covered by water 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.650
 an abundant resource in its three fundamental states 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 gazolla 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 there are 97% of that water is salty 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.520
 one of the three groups of protesters who now 12 only a small part 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 a man who passed through the place is the very person of the human condition 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.470
 the mota-engil fun the company explains that all this 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.780
 the few learned to use water 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 for the progressive 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 the precipitations 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.940
 approximately 16% of all fresh water on the planet is in Brazil 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.300
 the pocket video team not only as a health recording source 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 but also as a source of program wealth 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.600
 the edital water for our existence because the human body could not resist 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 30 days without moisturizing 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.870
 all this is understandable 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.870
 our body is made up of 70% water 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.180
 thinking that the United chose the decade of 2005 to 2015 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 with an international water decade 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 adopting the motto of water for dictation 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.299
 the water cycle has its beginning in the evaporation of the wires 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.480
 lakes and oceans 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 the factor forms clouds 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.940
 rain water 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 formal paulo in the form of rain 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.429
 when reaching the ground 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.429
 part of the rain is missing for the rivers lakes and oceans 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 and another infiltrates the land to the Camaçari to the external reserves 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 this water contributes to keep victor 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.849
 Click here for Biology 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.339
 while the water accumulated by the infiltration effect 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.859
 returns to the surface in the form of springs 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.529
 I had accepted to be a little bit 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.529
 stays behind in your magical gift from the depths 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.609
 The mineral water 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.609
 the unstable nature 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.939
 the original beyond the depths of the earth while remaining underground 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.420
 its physico-chemical properties change through the absorption of 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.449
 essential minerals 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:46.749
 during its path in the ground until near the bridges it crosses red 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.009
 full of mineral substances 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.380
 having as main elements of the plateau 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.469
 once of a 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.569
 the sodium 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.519
 case but stay out 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.559
 in Brazil there are records of fossils from 1540 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:06.029
 brazil was the first country in latin america to bottle water 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.479
 mineral in 1890 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.479
 the mark of degradation the redd 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.179
 are lourenço and the main hydromineral resort of the country 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.709
 situated in the south of minas gerais' at the foot of the mountain range of mantiqueira 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.569
 lourenço is at an altitude of 167 meters 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.140
 in a region of velocity 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.629
 They were waiting. 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.790
 mineral water from São Lourenço changing a valley surrounded by 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.489
 year 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.959
 near the confluence of three children 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.659
 the creek is lourenço the green river and occurred ipi 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.639
 the power of the waters of the strong of its effects 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.959
 made the city of são lourenço an important 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.509
 tourist center 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.579
 a charge 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.019
 eliane was inaugurated yesterday 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.359
 near the spring 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.930
 and from that moment on 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.930
 the flow of visitors more whole 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.179
 the main attraction of the city I did part of the afternoon 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.610
 within the park the value to this is the physical health center are 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.199
 offered various treatments based on the properties that would have given up 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.199
 of travelling 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.090
 water collection is only done so as to conserve all 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.719
 hydromineral properties of water 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.939
 pumping storage are designed to prevent any 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.939
 changes in product characteristics 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.930
 the mineral water is lourenço the bottled in the next ford itself is 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.129
 within an environment and to sterilize 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.470
 The facilities strictly follow all the rules of the legislation in order to preserve 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.049
 protect your integrity against possible incidents of impurities 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:16.430
 in the water are lourenço is of course must be only the characteristics 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:19.869
 which confer digestive properties 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.000
 is the water that prepares and purifies the palate for an intense experience 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.749
 gastronomic 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.580
 the consumption of mineral water 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.110
 It's a party for the 5 senses. 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.210
 see the luster of the crystalline water 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.210
 or the risk of butterflies 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.939
 visit the delicacy of the year 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.120
 I hoped the bubble burst in the roof of my mouth 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.120
 and the complexity of the ores I speak 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.069
 Rob the miner are lourenço 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.069
 is the fruit of the earth's patient work 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.710
 and the world's leading bottled water market I have a commitment 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.710
 with the responsible use of this natural resource 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:12.229
 present in this segment since 1969 created in 2002 the nestlé waters is present 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.319
 in 130 countries 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.889
 with about 70 different brands of high quality mineral water with 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.080
 featured in brazil 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 for the traditional are now two 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.639
 They are lourenço the water of the good table
