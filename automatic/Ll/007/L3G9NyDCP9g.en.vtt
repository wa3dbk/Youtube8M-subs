00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
go through qualifying I tend to think

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.850 
go through qualifying I tend to think
that<00:03:09.600> he<00:03:09.720> needs<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.020> find<00:03:10.350> some<00:03:10.680> consistency

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that he needs to find some consistency

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.640 
that he needs to find some consistency
especially<00:03:11.850> on<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.090> back<00:03:12.300> line<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.020> despite

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
especially on that back line so despite

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.860 
especially on that back line so despite
a<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.760> down<00:03:14.880> performance<00:03:15.450> certainly<00:03:15.750> from

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
a up and down performance certainly from

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.479 
a up and down performance certainly from
Timmy<00:03:16.110> Chandler<00:03:16.500> down<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.800> Honduras<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.340> think

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
Timmy Chandler down on Honduras I think

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.800
