00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.960
 marcela mate to a poet margin of favoritism as he said he shrugged 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.719
 always the cup everything can pass well 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.720
 It is a very open end interpretation and vala carla querétaro querétaro qro 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.740
 level 20s very high hobby because I like the shock before the spirou level 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.739
 very strong craft not Panesso are not two teams that are playing the 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.919
 semifinals and the final will be the one that went down until now I'm going to 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.909
 defend as stem another cup more 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.140
 Ford has been 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.920
 it's like a match 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 in moderation a strong 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 let's play strong you know we have other game options and it's going to be going to be a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.560
 difficult match as and has raised them a difficult match this before to the 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.820
 mornings what 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.880
 we have nothing to lose and sauce and you have to give everything is going to be difficult 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 I think the key is going to be the defense 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.399
 nothing else 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.180
 is to try to live with that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.910
 at some point you are hurt by others and in others it is not a matter of 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.560
 to be sitting us what we have to be that is in 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.830
 in maintaining concentration right now one more percent day and good and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.740
 to analyze the river the rival we have for tomorrow and try to start the team 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.950
 the best way and especially play with a lot of desire not these tone at the end 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.980
 they take the one who has the desire to win the one who has many 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.340
 much desire to win for it alerted also that rakocevic 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 that's why there must be a great team playing very well 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.860
 we must as a set gives a very big trade power with many players 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.680
 that we have to focus better but in everything that is on the court that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.170
 summit moment of the party 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
 it is about giving the 8 more than nothing because 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.060
 I had two games played breaking games 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.880
 i 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.730
 and took advantage and not in the unicaja should have 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.580
 He has a great team to follow them 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.990
 but it is a national combat 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.119
 who deserves a few months the teams and says cession
