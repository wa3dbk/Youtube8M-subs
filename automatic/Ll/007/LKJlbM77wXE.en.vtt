00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
really should consider insulating them

their great aesthetic feature of this

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.330 
their great aesthetic feature of this
plant<00:01:28.090> okay<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.080> now<00:01:29.410> we're<00:01:29.560> gonna<00:01:29.650> go<00:01:30.160> over

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
plant okay so now we're gonna go over

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.850 
plant okay so now we're gonna go over
here<00:01:30.730> and<00:01:31.530> Glynn<00:01:32.530> has<00:01:32.560> some<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
here and Glynn has some of the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.500 
here and Glynn has some of the
insulation<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:36.790> that's<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.120> first<00:01:37.390> thing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
insulation and so that's the first thing

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.870 
insulation and so that's the first thing
but<00:01:38.350> feel<00:01:38.770> like<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:39.070> don't<00:01:39.190> have<00:01:39.310> insulation

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
but feel like we don't have insulation

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.250 
but feel like we don't have insulation
could<00:01:40.270> we<00:01:40.360> use<00:01:40.480> something<00:01:40.750> else

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
could we use something else

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.590 
could we use something else
yeah<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.620> certainly<00:01:41.980> could<00:01:42.340> use<00:01:42.550> bubble<00:01:43.390> wrap

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
yeah you certainly could use bubble wrap

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.030 
yeah you certainly could use bubble wrap
or<00:01:44.490> cardboard<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:46.440> maybe<00:01:47.440> build<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.830> cage

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
or cardboard or maybe build a cage

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.620 
or cardboard or maybe build a cage
around<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.670> fill<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.940> with<00:01:49.060> hay<00:01:49.240> or<00:01:49.540> straw

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
around it and fill it with hay or straw

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.720 
around it and fill it with hay or straw
or<00:01:50.230> something<00:01:50.260> like<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.770> if<00:01:51.280> you're<00:01:51.640> going

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
or something like that if you're going

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.040 
or something like that if you're going
to<00:01:51.820> use<00:01:51.940> hay<00:01:52.090> or<00:01:52.150> straw<00:01:52.330> make<00:01:52.660> sure<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.930> you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
to use hay or straw make sure that you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.200 
to use hay or straw make sure that you
get<00:01:53.260> something<00:01:53.890> isn't<00:01:54.280> full<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.580> weed<00:01:54.850> seeds

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
and it's a good idea to go ahead and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.470 
and it's a good idea to go ahead and
start<00:02:01.930> 8<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:03.160> 10<00:02:03.370> inches<00:02:03.670> above<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.090> ground

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
start 8 to 10 inches above the ground

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.420 
start 8 to 10 inches above the ground
because<00:02:04.780> you're<00:02:04.900> gonna<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.200> mulching<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.950> to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
because you're gonna be mulching that to

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.130 
because you're gonna be mulching that to
help<00:02:06.550> protect<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.210> root<00:02:07.420> stock<00:02:07.750> there

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
help protect the root stock there

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.410 
help protect the root stock there
alright<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.160> how<00:02:09.340> far<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.879> we<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.270> go

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
alright and how far do we have to go

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.240 
alright and how far do we have to go
well<00:02:10.869> that's<00:02:11.019> kind<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.920> usually

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
well that's kind of up to you we usually

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.150 
well that's kind of up to you we usually
go<00:02:12.370> about<00:02:12.489> 4<00:02:12.910> wraps<00:02:13.239> with<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> insulation<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
go about 4 wraps with the insulation and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.309 
go about 4 wraps with the insulation and
that's<00:02:15.489> far<00:02:15.760> enough<00:02:15.879> up<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:17.050> ensure

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
that's far enough up that we can ensure

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.960 
that's far enough up that we can ensure
that<00:02:17.349> even<00:02:17.800> if<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> begins<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.550> melt<00:02:18.700> down

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that even if it begins to melt down

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.970 
that even if it begins to melt down
below<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.810> insulation<00:02:20.410> we're<00:02:20.590> still<00:02:20.830> going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
below the insulation we're still going

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
below the insulation we're still going
to<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.190> plenty<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.940> left<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.870> actively<00:02:23.260> grow

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
to have plenty of left to actively grow

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680 
to have plenty of left to actively grow
once<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> season<00:02:24.310> begins<00:02:24.550> again<00:02:24.850> alright<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
once the season begins again alright and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.080 
once the season begins again alright and
then<00:02:25.810> during<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.230> winter<00:02:26.470> time<00:02:26.680> if

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
then during the winter time if

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.400 
then during the winter time if
lose<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> leaves<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.200> not<00:02:28.379> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
lose some of the leaves it's not a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.350 
lose some of the leaves it's not a
problem<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.069> no<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.269> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
problem is it no it's not we kind of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240 
problem is it no it's not we kind of
leave<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> leaves<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.080> there<00:02:31.349> for<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:32.190> as

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
leave the leaves on there for for as

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.369 
leave the leaves on there for for as
long<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.690> then<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.319> start

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
long as we can and then as they start

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.990 
long as we can and then as they start
melting<00:02:34.709> back<00:02:35.010> we'll<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.489> cut<00:02:35.700> them<00:02:35.790> back

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
melting back we'll just cut them back

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.449 
melting back we'll just cut them back
until<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.530> starts<00:02:37.950> melting<00:02:38.129> down

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
until if it really starts melting down

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.009 
until if it really starts melting down
we'll<00:02:38.640> cut<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> about<00:02:38.940> six<00:02:39.330> inches<00:02:39.660> above<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
we'll cut it about six inches above the

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.559 
we'll cut it about six inches above the
wrap<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.310> bananas<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.000> know<00:02:42.060> before

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
wrap because the bananas I know before

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.610 
wrap because the bananas I know before
they<00:02:42.690> used<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> say<00:02:43.050> well<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.379> have<00:02:43.410> any

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
they used to say well if you have any

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.229 
they used to say well if you have any
damage<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> study<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.970> take<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
damage on the study we have to take it

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.789 
damage on the study we have to take it
all<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.420> way<00:02:45.540> down<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.200> could<00:02:46.379> just<00:02:46.530> cut

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
all the way down but you could just cut

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.520 
all the way down but you could just cut
below<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.580> rotting<00:02:48.209> part<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.720> it'll<00:02:49.290> start

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
below that rotting part and it'll start

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.839 
below that rotting part and it'll start
to<00:02:49.620> sprout<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.700> it

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
to sprout right there I'm on it

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.089 
to sprout right there I'm on it
absolutely<00:02:51.599> it'll<00:02:51.840> it'll<00:02:51.989> unfurl<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.860> begin

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
absolutely it'll it'll unfurl and begin

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.339 
absolutely it'll it'll unfurl and begin
growing<00:02:53.459> again<00:02:53.730> right<00:02:54.180> from<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.420> point<00:02:54.780> so

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
growing again right from that point so

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.289 
growing again right from that point so
we're<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.250> garden<00:02:56.370> could<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.849> plant<00:02:57.150> they

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
we're in the garden could we plant they

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.940 
we're in the garden could we plant they
say<00:02:57.510> we're<00:02:57.660> gonna<00:02:57.750> start<00:02:58.080> next<00:02:58.230> year<00:02:58.470> what

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
say we're gonna start next year what

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.770 
say we're gonna start next year what
kind<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.280> needs<00:02:59.519> would<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> banana<00:03:00.299> mate<00:03:00.569> well

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
kind of needs would the banana mate well

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
kind of needs would the banana mate well
they<00:03:00.870> certainly<00:03:01.110> like<00:03:01.440> full<00:03:01.709> Sun<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.220> want

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
they certainly like full Sun they want

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.339 
they certainly like full Sun they want
to<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.000> full<00:03:03.150> Sun<00:03:03.390> location<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.140> can

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
to be in a full Sun location if you can

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.140 
to be in a full Sun location if you can
find<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> location<00:03:05.130> that's<00:03:05.220> sheltered<00:03:05.670> from

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
find a location that's sheltered from

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.600 
find a location that's sheltered from
the<00:03:06.239> wind<00:03:06.590> your<00:03:07.590> foliage<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.099> last<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.459> lot

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the wind your foliage will last a lot

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
the wind your foliage will last a lot
longer<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.510> those<00:03:09.660> are<00:03:09.690> your<00:03:09.930> two<00:03:10.410> main

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
soil compost in the soil drainage that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
soil compost in the soil drainage that
absolutely<00:03:17.129> yeah<00:03:17.430> they<00:03:17.610> like<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> little
