00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 fucking little message of violetta hi 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.150
 kery I would like to have your opinion of this 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 theme on this text that I got on 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.620
 facebook in the beach in English from 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.929
 nothing if you want so this text I 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 tell you in a few months it's yohan 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 heck way we were acidic that's at 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 to say you are not or not too fat 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.100
 you are too passive so I have 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 a lot talked about in the videos I you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.019
 have said many times it turns out that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 when we actually have this text defends 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.849
 something to which I abound I adhere 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.180
 totally since I am convinced and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.500
 it's physiologically quite 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.579
 pack down that principle on the agent am 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.149
 at the level of bios or it starts to be 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 long it starts to be long so we go 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.520
 we will be short on this one so this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.289
 text defends the idea that we are not 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 is not too big you're too acidic and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.930
 there it is that it is the obvious same I 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.520
 am convinced that the body when one is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.469
 a strong technique you know that the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.699
 body is obliged these toxins can not 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 keep them as is because she would 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 too aggressive for tissues and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.110
 organs surrounding them with a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.939
 lipid layer for to protect themselves 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 of these toxins and he stores them 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 and it's stored in a corner and so the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.500
 formation and retention of fatty acids 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 by the organism it is favored by 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 the presence of toxins 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.930
 she is all the more favored I 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.040
 would even say that our palatability 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 food certainly his idea of ​​where 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.500
 the idea unconsciously by our 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.060
 need to protect our body against 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.729
 the acid attacks so to bring to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 body enough fat and store enough 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 of fat to protect against 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 these acid attacks of toxins and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.049
 the organism you are going to see you are going 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.880
 lose weight you will lose the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.220
 fat on everything and that's a 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 beautiful cock it is obvious we are 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 not too big, we are too acidic 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 Above all we are too passive we 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.509
 undress ds means early as 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 room-canne diniz and we will see melt 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.960
 theirs and that's where the wonder of this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.329
 approach that is to say we do not have 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.700
 need to reduce his caloric intake 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.440
 we do not need to eat less we have 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.750
 need to eat better and better 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.170
 to be my acids and less acid for 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.420
 allow to evacuate all this all 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.330
 these toxins and at that moment the mass 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 greasy that we had in excess will have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.190
 no more utility and it will disappear 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 itself 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.680
 so here is yes violetta I am 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.700
 absolutely agree with that I did not 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 mentioned in several videos
