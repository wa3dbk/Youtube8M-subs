00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.490
 and we are back with the 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 delicious cookies with sparks 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.259
 chocolate perfect and ideal for 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.230
 little girls 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.020
 cookies and know that to give away 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.239
 because then it happens not for 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.149
 mike that we are going to send you are here and 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:30.110
 in each one we are going to put a candle with 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:32.660
 a dedication that say chicharr贸n 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.730
 in the form of lionfish from 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.730
 tigers and yellow flowers 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.690
 well this recipe is very simple and 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.090
 I have all my ingredients carry a 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.850
 little butter also some 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.949
 sugar muscovado eggs essence 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.219
 vanilla powder to bake flour and 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:55.270
 also real chocolate sprinkles 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.030
 and it's very simple to do so is that 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.280
 I will put before I start doing my 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.220
 first batidillo will put the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.500
 butter that is at temperature 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.370
 environment if you are taking out the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.120
 fridge 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.400
 so I invite you to never melt it 10 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.370
 seconds in the microwave or look I'm going to 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.430
 put the muscovado sugar 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.700
 Now we are going to put the little stick and I'm going to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.820
 whipping cream this type of recipes is 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.410
 great for children then good yo 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 also because he 's a brother and I'm 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.150
 thinking not so is that if you invite the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.460
 little friends of the kids and then it's 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.560
 father to put them like they already ate 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.560
 and the whole show and they get hungry out there 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.420
 of the four or five p.m. them 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.390
 can put cookies if not so good 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.870
 for the night they are so pitar mom 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.480
 put him quietly 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.560
 no account is given and they will put fiber 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.020
 in the street super well saved the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.450
 saved do not know adhered to the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.330
 flour is extraordinary nothing more than 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.850
 before putting it the flax seeds do not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
 you have to crush them and then 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.240
 incorporate it is important that they are 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
 crushed because otherwise the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.960
 nutrients to the intestine but they pass 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.370
 intact and then took the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.560
 fiber or anything the lines there are that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.630
 Feel them a little bit and put them on 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 Bavosi are worth putting but I have 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.540
 to the chia or know not good 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.540
 We are going to put the eggs waiting for you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 in God 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.500
 this is a little egg 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.030
 here weird that it detonated really I 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.609
 agreement that makes experiments in the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 science class and it was very rare that 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.540
 they thundered an egg 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.160
 three little eggs and we're going to beat it 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.060
 Now put the vanilla 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.640
 and we are going to put the baking powder 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.610
 with the flour 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.010
 and now we are going to make a mix and 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.970
 just with a spoon you front what 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.980
 I achieved 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.980
 then because I feel that it is delicate 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.330
 I do not know why I feel that what 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.360
 We feel the same thing is not and notice that no 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.820
 It is a roll of confidence and it is rambito 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.320
 a roll that really is in four 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.690
 legs to do everything you have 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:38.260
 flour where it has four legs 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.260
 the goal is not to be stained 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.020
 nobody but here just in cello towards the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.580
 giant 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.480
 Well, no 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.480
 where to know where 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.030
 if the man asks to see your money that 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.530
 forgive the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.530
 and now 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:14.410
 good the chocolate district 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.750
 and she started claiming the money 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.040
 good to my taste and it seems like everything 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.040
 well mixed then 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:30.289
 let's start making some balls 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:35.199
 pretty look a little bit smaller 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.199
 more so then chiquitas 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.310

 another little bit like that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.720
 and I think he exaggerates xavi like that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.370
 A) Yes 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.639

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.940
 if not 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.439
 we regret the good trope we are going to put 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.119
 you're ok and we're going to put them in a 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.949
 little plate and we will give them a place 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:20.899

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:26.700

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.460
 they stay 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.420
 then it says to me that without crushing 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.420
 let's get out of the balls 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.580
 if it is a little ball in an imaginary world 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.819

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:41.480
 minutes to be baked 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:44.650
