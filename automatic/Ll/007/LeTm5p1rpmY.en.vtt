00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello in this video I come to answer a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.150
 question that each time they make me more 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.000
 often and is which is the best custom rom 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.250
 for my samsung galaxy 6 well many 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 people arrive new to my channel to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 daily and they say this guy is great 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 has videos on how to root the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 galaxy is like installing a custom rom and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 have a lot of videos on these 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 but which is the best which is the one that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.760
 allows to have better performance better 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.710
 stability gives me longer duration of 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 battery in my phone in short 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.250
 which is the best custom rom so with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 I'm going to answer this video from a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.399
 very simple way good to imagine that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 I have cyanogenmod installed today 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 7.2 and I have done an analysis in my 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 channel and left the name of that rom that is 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 which I consider today the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.210
 better for my phone 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.879
 well tomorrow it turns out that I try a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.270
 rom that is much better and I do a 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.489
 analysis to this it is worth because I consider 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.559
 from that moment that has happened to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.480
 be the best custom rom as well me 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.850
 I would take this video and institute the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 name of the previous custom rom for this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.670
 that would be for me the best custom rom 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 of the moment 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 and also we would stick the link of this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.689
 video in the description for you to go 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 to see it and if you are interested and if you like 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.860
 then install it in this way what 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.649
 I would avoid would be the same questions 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.690
 always also that you can 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.850
 have your phone always with what 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.740
 better because it's true that this is my 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.350
 that is to say, it is the best 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 custom rom for me there is no custom 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 rom best for the galaxy eyes that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.170
 It depends on the needs and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 tastes of each one but you also have to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.330
 keep in mind that I have already tried 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.520
 very many and I can tell you that if it's the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.220
 that I have chosen as the best one is because 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 I would have chosen many before and it will be 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 the one that I like the most and the one that most 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.190
 recommend so this video will be 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.470
 always very updated you are going to have 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.690
 always the description the best custom 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.950
 rom for this phone and in case you 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.140
 you want to take a look from time to time 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
 when for example a custom rom 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 that has a lot of stability so 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
 that has been all in this video see you 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.090
 and a greeting to another
