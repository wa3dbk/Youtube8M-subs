 we arrive at bkf tv vehicle test 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.519
 This time we have one yes 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.219
 inexpensive but nevertheless solid 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.990
 vehicle selected which one can 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.170
 already see a bit but let 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.170
 surprise you 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.920
 Welcome to bkf tv vehicle test 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.300
 This time we let us come 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 the dacia loose and that the combination of the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.380
 dollars so why do we do that made 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.200
 simply we were just 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.610
 Look it is a cheap one 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.870
 inexpensive vehicle with one 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.580
 certain equipment now we want 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.410
 but just look , he dives something 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.140
 he dived for families 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 Airplanes Airport shuttle for taxi 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 or just for smaller hotels what 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.600
 out groups always accurate 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.600
 on 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.659
 first category exterior view again 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.900
 pretty sleek from the roofline 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.280
 roof railing on top he has 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.830
 Alloy wheels in this version 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.630
 In doing so, you get an appealing design 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.100
 From the outside, it's time to put pressure on it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.810
 yes and here is the heart that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.009
 has loose kombis 90 ps 1400 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.530
 cubic centimeter 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.320
 yes and I would not say just one 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.810
 Racehorse but he comes so wonderfully 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.940
 rightly and especially favorable in the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.190
 fuel consumption because we line between 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 four and a half and five and a half liters and 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.000
 that is already an announcement or 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.670
 not equipped is ours 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.550
 test vehicle of the dacia dokr kombi with 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 two normal front left front doors 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.140
 right and two sliding doors too 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.330
 once right and once left and us 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.130
 then have two rear doors the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 asymmetrical are so that is the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.720
 left door is wider than the right one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.269
 door with the left door first 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.250
 rises when we from the bka ftv with the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.140
 Zollstock look or songs scale 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.299
 or according to how you measure it 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.810
 Everyone wants to know what's going on 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.000
 namely measuring the door opening and that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 Very important for the taxi area 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.239
 and I honestly do not have to say that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.590
 only for the taxi area special airport 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.760
 and immediately so we have 70 cm of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.880
 Measured from left to right 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.790
 then have a height of one meter and 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.730
 11 the legroom is at 18 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.890
 centimeter at a set 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.410
 position of the driver's seat and then have 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.340
 we still total 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.840
 with the 18 cm a seat 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.840
 Legroom of 68 cm 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.970
 hmm 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.900
 basic price a little over 14,000 you have to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
 say is a good reason price and you 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.060
 but gets a lot for the money 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.220
 because this vehicle costs over 16,000 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.300
 euro in this test at the equipment and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.040
 there must be honestly say that 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.470
 dashboard with display 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.170
 navigation system and there it is 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.130
 with in there and there I have to say for the 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.620
 price is it an alternative so of the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.770
 driving sense the steering is so 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.290
 that's really nice , that's me 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.950
 can wonderful the vehicle in the curve 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.350
 bring in 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.300
 So it's nothing where you say my god 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.840
 that's kind of woody or it is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.650
 is somehow how should I say not 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.060
 according to the price I am amazed 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.130
 and just have to say I feel 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.669
 also probably the steering wheel has a good one 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.590
 handle the fittings are in grip mountain 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.190
 reach and took the air conditioning 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.570
 have up here 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.640
 the navigation system with touchscreen 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.980
 we have everything we need directly 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.290
 in front of the nose 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.430
 What surprised me is that 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.890
 luggage compartment volume 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.230
 that means we have 800 liters here 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.060
 luggage space volume and when I move forward 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.919
 would the house the tilt back bench yet 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.750
 I come up to 3300 liters what I'm in 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.729
 trunk has available so 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.870
 that's me, I'll say damn 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.729
 big trunk 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.010
 if you take so completely looks on 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.780
 the vehicle length and if you put that on 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.010
 The vehicle itself looks like I have now 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.720
 Just put it in zollstock 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.530
 and there we are already at one 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.550
 Loading length of one meter and pull 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.870
 so passengers 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:44.930
 yes luggage indeed well that is possible in the 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.130
 German mastiff combinatorial series four cylinder 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.900
 1400 public his there I have yes 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.740
 already said 90 ps 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.100
 and in the eco mode is a bit sluggish 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.110
 but eco-mode means consumption 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.910
 much less and there you have to 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.759
 decide whether you are now the 90th 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.930
 ps wants to use or if you want more in the eco 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.160
 driving mode would like to drive the itself 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.590
 fink at the steering wheel on I have one 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.880
 good grip so what is very nice 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.419
 handy also niki I hold firmly direct 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.070
 steering 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.650
 So that means I can do it right 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.470
 beautiful here with the curves purely aim 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.560
 and so can also be wonderful with 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.750
 So is also a steering you as 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.810
 Otherwise, steering can mean otherwise 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.860
 everything under control area that means so 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.570
 navigation system with touchscreen even 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.669
 that I need only here on the 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.770
 single buttons to go and have already 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:42.720
 I all my function right on the spot 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.330
 on-board computer tachometer 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.210
 all I need to drive is in 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.120
 German printer combination available 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.150

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.419
 it does not shine the sun and 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.250
 Immediately this is not wonderful 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.990
