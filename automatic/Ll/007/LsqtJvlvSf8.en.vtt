how everything exactly affected with the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.110 
well now it's perf la dot draw PS space
true<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:25.490> comes<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:25.820> pretty<00:01:25.910> handy

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
true this comes in pretty handy

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.060 
true this comes in pretty handy

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
figure out what kind of frame rates

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.690 
figure out what kind of frame rates
you're<00:01:29.480> getting<00:01:30.070> which<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.280> don't<00:01:31.430> know<00:01:31.490> by<00:01:31.640> you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
getting curious um what the effect is of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.400 
getting curious um what the effect is of
going<00:02:01.010> from<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.400> alterus<00:02:01.850> below<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.410> didn't

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.230 
going from like alterus below I didn't
really<00:02:03.620> think<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:04.070> was<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.280> age<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.120> in

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240

see<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.890> big<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.160> difference<00:02:16.310> off<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.760> bat

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
but at the ticket point map I didn't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.250 
but at the ticket point map I didn't
think<00:02:19.580> there<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.000> lot<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.270> render<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
think there was a lot to render so you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.290 
think there was a lot to render so you
see<00:02:21.410> me<00:02:21.530> hop<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> chopper<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.489> I'm

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
see me hop in the chopper and I'm

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.300 
see me hop in the chopper and I'm
actually<00:02:23.510> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.530> little<00:02:24.709> flying<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
actually going to do a little flying and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:55.500 
actually going to do a little flying and
see<00:02:25.430> how<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.640> affects<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.360> dips

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.300 

now<00:02:56.510> I've<00:02:56.660> got<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.930> go<00:02:57.050> for<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.290> little<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.500> fly

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
now I've got to go for a little a fly

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.830 
now I've got to go for a little a fly
correction<00:02:58.850> right<00:02:58.970> there<00:02:59.210> so<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> don't<00:02:59.600> hit<00:02:59.810> a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
correction right there so I don't hit a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360 
correction right there so I don't hit a
wall<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.260> middle<00:03:00.290> my<00:03:00.560> test<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.010> I'm<00:03:01.100> going

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
wall in the middle my test but I'm going

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.950 
wall in the middle my test but I'm going
to<00:03:01.400> go<00:03:01.550> ahead<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.790> bump<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.150> back<00:03:02.330> down<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.720> low

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
to go ahead and bump it back down to low

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.630 
to go ahead and bump it back down to low
and<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:04.340> will<00:03:04.880> see<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> slight<00:03:05.720> difference<00:03:06.230> but

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and I will see a slight difference but

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.560 
and I will see a slight difference but
you<00:03:07.640> know<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.210> think<00:03:08.390> it's<00:03:08.480> going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
you know really what I think it's going

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.390 
you know really what I think it's going
to<00:03:08.660> make<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> big<00:03:09.140> difference<00:03:09.500> as<00:03:09.710> a<00:03:09.740> driver

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
to make the big difference as a driver

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.250 
to make the big difference as a driver
optimization<00:03:11.150> like<00:03:11.390> beta<00:03:11.660> drivers<00:03:12.080> from

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
optimization like beta drivers from

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.290 
optimization like beta drivers from
Nvidia<00:03:12.320> practically<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.430> came<00:03:13.730> out<00:03:14.000> and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
Nvidia practically just came out and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.790 
Nvidia practically just came out and
that<00:03:14.360> actually<00:03:14.690> helped<00:03:14.900> my<00:03:15.020> set<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.380> lot<00:03:15.560> I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
that actually helped my set up a lot I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.570 
that actually helped my set up a lot I
have<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.030> 4770k<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.180> GTX<00:03:17.900> 780<00:03:18.350> which<00:03:19.340> should

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
have a 4770k a GTX 780 which should

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.880 
have a 4770k a GTX 780 which should
normally<00:03:20.000> destroy<00:03:20.510> most<00:03:21.230> video<00:03:21.590> games

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
normally destroy most video games

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:32.130 
normally destroy most video games
regardless<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:23.240> settings

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.179 

ultimately<00:03:33.140> what<00:03:33.290> I'm<00:03:33.379> noticing<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.069> my

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
ultimately what I'm noticing is that my

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.459 
ultimately what I'm noticing is that my
lows<00:03:34.489> aren't<00:03:34.849> as<00:03:35.000> low<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.510> my<00:03:35.810> eyes<00:03:36.049> are<00:03:36.079> on

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
lows aren't as low and my eyes are on

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.770 
lows aren't as low and my eyes are on
average<00:03:36.859> by<00:03:37.040> about<00:03:37.069> 20<00:03:37.670> frames<00:03:38.000> more<00:03:38.359> like<00:03:38.659> you

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
average by about 20 frames more like you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.390 
average by about 20 frames more like you
see<00:03:38.900> me<00:03:39.019> actually<00:03:39.140> breaking<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.859> 90<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
see me actually breaking like 90 and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.580 
see me actually breaking like 90 and
almost<00:03:40.670> 100<00:03:41.140> I'm<00:03:42.140> going<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.319> go<00:03:42.379> ahead<00:03:42.439> and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
almost 100 I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.920 
almost 100 I'm going to go ahead and
show<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.859> next<00:03:42.920> command<00:03:43.430> was<00:03:43.640> how<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.629> cap

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
show you the next command was how to cap

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.830 
show you the next command was how to cap
your<00:03:44.959> frame<00:03:45.439> rate<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.299> personally<00:03:50.719> think

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
your frame rate and I personally think

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.550 
your frame rate and I personally think
that<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.260> kind<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.769> creates<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.189> weird<00:03:52.430> effect

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that this kind of creates a weird effect

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.440 
that this kind of creates a weird effect
you'll<00:03:54.560> see<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:55.040> my<00:03:55.310> frames<00:03:55.639> do<00:03:55.909> drop<00:03:56.209> down

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
you'll see that my frames do drop down

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.720 
you'll see that my frames do drop down
to<00:03:56.629> 30<00:03:56.900> but<00:03:57.620> they<00:03:57.829> also<00:03:58.040> get<00:03:58.310> down<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.609> like

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
to 30 but they also get down to like

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.069 
to 30 but they also get down to like
around<00:03:58.969> you<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.510> 20<00:04:00.189> 26<00:04:01.189> 27<00:04:01.609> 28<00:04:02.049> which<00:04:03.049> is

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
around you know 20 26 27 28 which is

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.220 
around you know 20 26 27 28 which is
right<00:04:03.980> there<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.250> I'm<00:04:04.489> playable<00:04:04.909> rate<00:04:05.230> it's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
right there that I'm playable rate it's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.589 
right there that I'm playable rate it's
not<00:04:06.349> really<00:04:06.680> something<00:04:06.919> that<00:04:07.879> is<00:04:08.269> going<00:04:08.389> to<00:04:08.450> be

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
not really something that is going to be

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.179 
not really something that is going to be
beneficial<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:09.379> time<00:04:09.530> maybe<00:04:09.739> if<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:09.950> capped

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
beneficial this time maybe if you capped

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.129 
beneficial this time maybe if you capped
around<00:04:10.489> 4045<00:04:11.090> here<00:04:11.689> in<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.810> second<00:04:12.049> you're

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
around 4045 here in a second you're

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:35.700 
around 4045 here in a second you're
going<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.319> see<00:04:12.439> me<00:04:12.560> cap<00:04:12.769> at<00:04:12.950> 60

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.130 

you<00:04:36.370> can<00:04:36.520> still<00:04:36.730> see<00:04:36.910> my<00:04:37.180> frames<00:04:37.570> did<00:04:37.930> pretty

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
you can still see my frames did pretty

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.540 
you can still see my frames did pretty
well<00:04:38.380> they<00:04:38.590> never<00:04:38.740> actually<00:04:38.920> dropped<00:04:39.370> below

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
well they never actually dropped below

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.780 
well they never actually dropped below
30<00:04:40.620> me<00:04:41.620> personally<00:04:42.100> I've<00:04:42.220> never<00:04:42.460> really<00:04:42.670> been

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
30 me personally I've never really been

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.480 
30 me personally I've never really been
a<00:04:42.850> fan<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.200> capping<00:04:44.200> my<00:04:44.380> frame<00:04:44.680> simply<00:04:45.100> because

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
a fan of capping my frame simply because

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.440 
a fan of capping my frame simply because
I<00:04:45.520> have<00:04:45.870> 144<00:04:46.870> Hertz<00:04:47.080> monitor<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:48.450> I've

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
I have 144 Hertz monitor and I've

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.940 
I have 144 Hertz monitor and I've
actually<00:04:49.840> got<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.380> point<00:04:50.560> where<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.830> think

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
actually got to the point where I think

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.260 
actually got to the point where I think
anything<00:04:51.580> blow<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.030> 80<00:04:52.360> 90<00:04:52.810> frames<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:54.270> you

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
anything blow like 80 90 frames is you

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.370 
anything blow like 80 90 frames is you
know<00:04:55.360> just<00:04:55.660> enough<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.020> piss<00:04:56.200> me<00:04:56.350> off

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
know just enough to piss me off

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.520 
know just enough to piss me off
basically<00:04:57.420> but<00:04:58.420> yeah<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.080> know<00:04:59.170> this

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
basically but yeah just so you know this

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.140 
basically but yeah just so you know this
video<00:04:59.710> was<00:04:59.920> mainly<00:05:00.250> about<00:05:00.460> all<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.730> console

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
video was mainly about all the console

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.660 
video was mainly about all the console
commands<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.140> what<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.470> can<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.980> cannot<00:05:03.430> do
