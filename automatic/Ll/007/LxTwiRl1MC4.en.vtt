know that we had five and a half inches

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.420 
know that we had five and a half inches
before<00:03:25.359> we<00:03:25.750> bound<00:03:26.079> off<00:03:26.350> for<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.010> center

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
before we bound off for the center

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.289 
before we bound off for the center
placket<00:03:28.859> there<00:03:29.859> are<00:03:30.160> nine<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:30.880> half<00:03:30.910> inches

we've already done gives us four inches
now<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.620> can<00:03:50.859> do<00:03:50.980> your<00:03:51.010> calculator<00:03:51.730> four

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
now you can do your calculator four

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.050 
now you can do your calculator four
inches<00:03:53.880> times<00:03:54.880> my<00:03:55.269> row<00:03:55.540> gauge<00:03:55.840> which<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.500> six

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
inches times my row gauge which is six

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.289 
inches times my row gauge which is six
point<00:03:58.060> one<00:03:58.569> five<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.319> equal<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.370> twenty<00:04:01.120> four

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
point one five is equal to twenty four

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.990 
point one five is equal to twenty four
point<00:04:01.660> six<00:04:01.930> rows<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.250> need<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.730> work

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000

point six rows so I need to work
twenty-five<00:04:04.959> rows<00:04:05.410> here<00:04:05.970> before<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> stop<00:04:07.480> and

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
twenty-five rows here before I stop and

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.610 
twenty-five rows here before I stop and
work<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.799> crewneck<00:04:09.370> shaping<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.410> go

to<00:04:14.170> work<00:04:14.380> straight<00:04:14.769> before<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.760> to

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
to work straight before you have to

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.750 
to work straight before you have to
start<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.359> front<00:04:16.630> neck<00:04:16.870> shaping<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.760> knit

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
start the front neck shaping and knit

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.060 
start the front neck shaping and knit
straight<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.690> there<00:04:20.019> make<00:04:20.590> sure<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.950> you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
straight to there make sure that you

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.510 
straight to there make sure that you
work<00:04:21.280> both<00:04:21.669> sides<00:04:21.970> at<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.300> same<00:04:22.450> time

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
work both sides at the same time

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.990 
work both sides at the same time
don't<00:04:24.030> forget<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.510> mark<00:04:24.720> your<00:04:24.900> underarms<00:04:25.530> with

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
don't forget to mark your underarms with

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.420 
don't forget to mark your underarms with
thread<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.870> don't<00:04:28.140> have<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.530> do<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.160> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
thread you don't have to do that but it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120 
thread you don't have to do that but it
it<00:04:29.970> saves<00:04:30.180> time<00:04:30.570> later<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.290> also<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:31.860> save

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
it saves time later and it also can save

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.590 
it saves time later and it also can save
you<00:04:32.280> from<00:04:32.490> error<00:04:32.820> because<00:04:33.240> you've<00:04:33.390> already

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
you from error because you've already

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.300 
you from error because you've already
counted<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.230> once<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.710> you'll<00:04:34.800> count<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.220> a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
counted it once and you'll count it a

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.670 
counted it once and you'll count it a
second<00:04:35.700> time<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.200> it's<00:04:37.500> one

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
second time and so it just is it's one

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.300 
second time and so it just is it's one
of<00:04:37.770> those<00:04:38.060> measure<00:04:39.060> twice<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.780> cut<00:04:40.440> once

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
of those measure twice and cut once

want to give you before you go the first

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.630 
want to give you before you go the first
one<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.260> I've<00:04:58.350> already<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.920> went<00:04:59.400> ahead<00:04:59.490> and

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
one is and I've already I went ahead and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.520 
one is and I've already I went ahead and
I<00:04:59.820> did<00:04:59.850> a<00:05:00.060> little<00:05:00.300> bit<00:05:00.480> more<00:05:00.720> knitting<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.170> here

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
I did a little bit more knitting on here

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.550 
I did a little bit more knitting on here
the<00:05:02.100> first<00:05:02.430> one<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.790> is<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.600> when<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.080> join<00:05:04.530> a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
the first one in is is when you join a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.550 
the first one in is is when you join a
new<00:05:04.950> ball<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.220> yarn<00:05:05.780> make<00:05:06.780> sure<00:05:07.050> that<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.320> have

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
new ball of yarn make sure that you have

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980 
new ball of yarn make sure that you have
a<00:05:07.590> good<00:05:07.950> long<00:05:08.280> edge<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.180> weave<00:05:09.450> hanging

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
a good long edge that you weave hanging

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.950 
a good long edge that you weave hanging
there<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:11.130> reason<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.760> when<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.330> go<00:05:12.660> back

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
there and the reason is when you go back

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.070 
there and the reason is when you go back
to<00:05:13.560> work<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.910> can<00:05:15.540> stick<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.810> needle

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
to work this in you can stick a needle

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.110 
to work this in you can stick a needle
in<00:05:16.350> there<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.800> you've<00:05:16.920> got<00:05:16.950> plenty<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.640> wiggle

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
in there and you've got plenty of wiggle

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.360 
in there and you've got plenty of wiggle
room<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:19.020> go<00:05:19.140> back<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.560> forth<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.980> then<00:05:20.100> cut

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
room to go back and forth and then cut

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.490 
room to go back and forth and then cut
it<00:05:20.490> off<00:05:20.640> if<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.210> just<00:05:21.390> leave<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:21.780> short<00:05:22.170> end

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
it off if you just leave a short end

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.650 
it off if you just leave a short end
then<00:05:23.010> when<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.370> try<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.700> put<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.180> tapestry

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
then when you try to put a tapestry

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.110 
then when you try to put a tapestry
needle<00:05:24.870> in<00:05:25.290> there<00:05:25.530> you've<00:05:25.890> got<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.340> take<00:05:26.970> it

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
needle in there you've got to take it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.600 
needle in there you've got to take it
out<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.510> it's<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.500> too<00:05:28.740> short<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.160> work<00:05:29.340> so

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
out and it's it's too short to work so

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.330 
out and it's it's too short to work so
give<00:05:29.910> yourself<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.390> generous<00:05:30.870> thing<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:32.040> other

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
I on a knit row so this tip is always go

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.040 
I on a knit row so this tip is always go
all<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.280> way<00:05:56.400> across<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:57.090> row<00:05:57.300> before<00:05:57.870> you

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
all the way across the row before you

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.340 
all the way across the row before you
stop<00:05:58.490> do<00:05:59.490> not<00:05:59.760> stop<00:06:00.180> in<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.540> middle<00:06:00.810> because

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350

you can count your rows however it's

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.510 
you can count your rows however it's
easier<00:06:06.570> if<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.140> just<00:06:07.169> finish<00:06:07.950> on<00:06:08.220> a<00:06:08.280> row

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
easier if you just finish on a row

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.290 
easier if you just finish on a row
unless<00:06:08.730> unless<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:09.900> get<00:06:10.640> interrupted<00:06:11.640> and
