00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.299
 ah 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.930
 hello welcome to my channel today I am going to 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.300
 present some super rich cookies 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.090
 walnut take note of the ingredients are 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.340
 250 grams of butter without salt 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.860
 room temperature 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.950
 also 375 grams of sifted flour 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.989
 100 sugar glas another 100 walnuts 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.780
 optionally ground whole walnuts as os 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.350
 I say that is optional and grated 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.350
 the stone 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:02.960
 we will put the butter 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.960
 together with the icing sugar in a blender 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 it can also be used by the tÃºrmix or 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.060
 hand will cost us a little bit more but it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060
 can do perfectly 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.549
 to me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.630
 once he has bleached the sugar with the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.649
 butter let's add the nut 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.649
 grated or ground 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 also the grated orange 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.880
 we will continue to beat a little 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 we keep adding the flour and what 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 we will do little by little 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.150
 we will know that the dough is ready when 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.460
 it does not get stuck in our hands or 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.550
 neither on the board or the base where the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.420
 we are moving forward now I have prepared a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.599
 Baking dish with paper 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.010
 of oven to go placing our 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.950
 cookies 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.170
 let's make some little balls not too 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.580
 big enough that they fit us in the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.270
 little hand 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.130
 a little circle we will crush a little 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.200
 here 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.870
 and we will put it in the tray paisa and the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.180
 Next we will put some 5 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.460
 centimeters because these tend to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.900
 expand so we'll have that 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.930
 caution if we will not all 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.480
 together we keep doing our 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.450
 balls and as I tell you we also have 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.880
 another option in this little ball we can 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.450
 put it optionally no longer needed 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.490
 because as you can see this is almost everything is not 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.450
 but to make it look prettier you can 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.600
 put it on there and that would be another 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.860
 option as I also say to 5 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.220
 we'll put 65 centimeters centimeters 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.220
 away 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.870
 we continue because here I have for a 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.909
 I'm going to put the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.450
 180 degree oven so you can go 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.450
 preheating 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.690
 and here I have the cookies already cold now 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.680
 with the sugar I have here we are going to 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.569
 reboar 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.569
 once in all the voted 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.130
 We will have some I hope you have 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.730

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.300
