an implement the won't fix the tractor
you<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.800> fixed<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.580> make<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.910> fit<00:03:10.150> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
you just fixed you make it fit and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.910 
you just fixed you make it fit and
that's<00:03:10.690> pretty<00:03:10.930> much<00:03:11.019> where<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.350> fabrication

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
that's pretty much where the fabrication

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.660 
that's pretty much where the fabrication
came<00:03:12.100> from

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.530 

well<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.270> may<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:18.440> no<00:03:18.590> more<00:03:18.770> than<00:03:18.920> necessary

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
well I may but no more than necessary

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.910 
well I may but no more than necessary
sure<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.720> must<00:03:20.810> have<00:03:20.959> been<00:03:21.050> some<00:03:21.620> unnecessary

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
sure it must have been some unnecessary

got to take there's no such thing as an
unnecessary<00:03:23.900> cup<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.170> tea<00:03:24.260> they<00:03:25.250> have

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.320 

it's<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.510> taste

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.620 

really<00:03:37.330> make<00:03:37.510> really<00:03:38.230> any<00:03:38.550> question<00:03:39.630> well

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
really make really any question well

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.650 
really make really any question well
make<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.410> short<00:03:41.830> answer<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.100> no<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:43.450> long

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
make the short answer is no the long

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:53.250 
make the short answer is no the long
answer<00:03:43.840> involves<00:03:48.660> working<00:03:49.660> out<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:52.260> first

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
answer involves working out so first

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.840 
answer involves working out so first
thing<00:03:53.380> we<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.590> find<00:03:53.770> out<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.490> volume

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
thing we have to find out is the volume

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.709 
thing we have to find out is the volume
of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> Pacific<00:03:55.390> Ocean

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.929 

1.12<00:04:01.719> million<00:04:02.439> times<00:04:02.769> more<00:04:03.189> molecules<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.819> h2o

1.12 million times more molecules of h2o

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.330 
1.12 million times more molecules of h2o
than<00:04:04.629> there<00:04:04.780> are<00:04:04.859> teaspoons<00:04:05.859> of<00:04:05.950> water<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.179 
than there are teaspoons of water in the
Pacific<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.349> have<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.859> act

hi<00:04:16.019> Rachel<00:04:16.229> good<00:04:16.470> question<00:04:16.829> yes<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> dip

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
hi Rachel good question yes a dip

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.189 
hi Rachel good question yes a dip
consider<00:04:18.060> either<00:04:18.239> blasting<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.810> or<00:04:18.989> dipping

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
consider either blasting it or dipping

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.020 
consider either blasting it or dipping
it<00:04:19.380> before<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.709> started<00:04:20.100> but<00:04:20.729> when<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.970> actually

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
it before we started but when I actually

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.730 
it before we started but when I actually
saw<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.359> state<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.019> bear<00:04:22.169> shell<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.620> was

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
saw the state of the bear shell it was

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.200 
saw the state of the bear shell it was
that<00:04:22.949> bad<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.250> realized<00:04:23.729> they<00:04:23.850> wouldn't

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
that bad I realized they wouldn't

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.610 
that bad I realized they wouldn't
actually<00:04:24.389> be<00:04:24.600> enough<00:04:24.840> original<00:04:25.199> metal<00:04:25.470> left

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
actually be enough original metal left

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.820 
actually be enough original metal left
to<00:04:25.740> warrant<00:04:26.040> it

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.339 

well<00:04:32.789> I<00:04:32.819> said<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.330> suppose<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> depends<00:04:34.169> on<00:04:34.229> what

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
well I said I suppose it depends on what

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.749 
well I said I suppose it depends on what
you're<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.590> with<00:04:35.360> if<00:04:36.360> you're<00:04:36.509> unarmed<00:04:36.960> then<00:04:37.349> I

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
you're on with if you're unarmed then I

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.119 
you're on with if you're unarmed then I
wouldn't<00:04:38.759> want<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.030> face<00:04:39.150> either<00:04:39.919> mm-hmm<00:04:40.919> I

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
wouldn't want to face either mm-hmm I

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.790 
wouldn't want to face either mm-hmm I
