everything<00:00:36.870> after<00:00:37.290> YP<00:00:37.920> mobile<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.579> added<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
everything after YP mobile we added a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
everything after YP mobile we added a
few<00:00:39.090> benchmark<00:00:39.780> apps<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> some<00:00:40.980> games<00:00:41.219> that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
few benchmark apps and some games that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
few benchmark apps and some games that
we've<00:00:41.790> demoed<00:00:42.059> separately<00:00:42.629> otherwise

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we've demoed separately otherwise

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
we've demoed separately otherwise
everything<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.340> comes<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> device

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
everything on here comes with the device

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
everything on here comes with the device
so<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.140> extremely<00:00:46.350> large<00:00:46.739> amount<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so there's an extremely large amount of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.840 
so there's an extremely large amount of
apps<00:00:47.730> coming<00:00:48.149> straight<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.600> AT&amp;T<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
apps coming straight from AT&amp;T and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
apps coming straight from AT&amp;T and
google<00:00:50.850> apps<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.449> well<00:00:51.480> comes<00:00:52.289> right

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
google apps on there as well comes right

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.619 
google apps on there as well comes right
with<00:00:52.590> chrome<00:00:53.120> also<00:00:54.120> comes<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.420> browser

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with chrome also comes with a browser

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
with chrome also comes with a browser
eventually<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.350> expecting<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> chrome

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
eventually we're expecting that chrome

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.299 
eventually we're expecting that chrome
will<00:00:56.370> only<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.969> devices<00:00:57.530> with<00:00:58.530> no<00:00:58.829> regular

them do whatever you need to do we have
one<00:01:32.310> sitting<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.350> that's<00:01:34.350> already<00:01:34.860> set

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
one sitting over here that's already set

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.819 
one sitting over here that's already set
up<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> work<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.030> sort<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.900> office<00:01:37.470> setting

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
up to work with a sort of office setting

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.300 
up to work with a sort of office setting
so<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:40.100> don't<00:01:41.100> poops

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so if we put this on top don't poops

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
so if we put this on top don't poops
it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> good<00:01:42.329> opportunity<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.930> show<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> what

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
the time of course and that's

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.899 
the time of course and that's
essentially<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.579> now<00:03:36.579> we're<00:03:36.669> going<00:03:36.759> to<00:03:36.819> look

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
essentially it now we're going to look

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.939 
essentially it now we're going to look
at<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.060> couple<00:03:37.239> other<00:03:37.540> features<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.709> separate

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
at a couple other features in a separate

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.559 
at a couple other features in a separate
video<00:03:39.159> but<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.639> is<00:03:39.759> the<00:03:39.879> basic<00:03:40.090> build<00:03:40.449> a

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
video but this is the basic build a

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.170 
video but this is the basic build a
device<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.889> it's<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.489> nice<00:03:42.669> device<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
device it's a it's a nice device that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.670 
device it's a it's a nice device that
sits<00:03:43.389> your<00:03:43.629> hand<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:43.989> it's<00:03:44.439> a<00:03:44.470> little<00:03:44.560> bit

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
sits your hand like so it's a little bit

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.469 
sits your hand like so it's a little bit
big<00:03:44.979> it's<00:03:45.549> almost<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.909> little<00:03:46.000> bit<00:03:46.180> slippery

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
big it's almost a little bit slippery

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.629 
big it's almost a little bit slippery
because<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.989> back<00:03:47.169> has<00:03:47.500> another<00:03:47.919> plastic

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
because the back has another plastic

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.939 
because the back has another plastic
panel<00:03:49.180> that's<00:03:49.329> really<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.829> doesn't

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
panel that's really you know it doesn't

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.740 
panel that's really you know it doesn't
have<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.159> grip<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:52.150> has<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.329> little<00:03:52.509> bit

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
have to grip to it it has a little bit

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.140 
have to grip to it it has a little bit
of<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.870> shiny<00:03:53.169> bit<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:54.129> ubl<00:03:54.519> see<00:03:54.699> them<00:03:54.790> close<00:03:54.970> up

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
of a shiny bit to ubl see them close up

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.999 
of a shiny bit to ubl see them close up
photos<00:03:55.509> the<00:03:55.959> little<00:03:56.229> the<00:03:56.379> triangles<00:03:56.889> there

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
photos the little the triangles there

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.929 
photos the little the triangles there
are<00:03:57.250> not<00:03:57.430> triangles<00:03:57.819> but<00:03:57.969> diamonds<00:03:58.599> in<00:03:58.930> there

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
are not triangles but diamonds in there

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.770 
are not triangles but diamonds in there
diamond<00:04:00.939> shape<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.419> can<00:04:01.569> see<00:04:01.689> different

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
diamond shape so you can see different

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.080 
diamond shape so you can see different
angles<00:04:02.319> here<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.009> have<00:04:03.159> a<00:04:03.189> single<00:04:03.430> LED<00:04:03.849> flash

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
angles here you have a single LED flash
