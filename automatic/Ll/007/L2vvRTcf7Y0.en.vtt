00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.910
 again I'm making this video 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.369
 tutorial because yesterday sports changed 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 the design of the page and for the new ones 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.039
 people who want to download the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 content to the consoles is very difficult 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.380
 know exactly where are the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 options in the creation center option 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.410
 to begin we enter the page 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.200
 which you can observe here 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.060
 when we enter we can change the 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.590
 I'm going to put it into language 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.920
 in Spanish from Spain we start session 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.990
 It is very important to know the mail 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.660

 they need to place to be able to enter 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.770
 the isport page do not have to create 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 a new account or register 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.840
 again since if you play 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.020
 online on their consoles already have a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.260

 you know it is necessary to go to our fifa to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.300
 main menu 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 already within the fifa menu we can 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710
 know that email can 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.430
 use for 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.040
 to the sport page we go to what 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.760

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.979
 that we need to place for 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.350
 be able to log in to the page and so 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.350
 to be able to enter the creation center 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 we started session and he shows us here 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.250
 content that brings the new design of the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.250
 page we go to what is fc 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.430
 we give you again to login 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.319
 now 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.220
 because if we go down here is just 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 as if we run session if they have played 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.130

 the center of creation if you change them 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.810
 again the language is necessary 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 to put it back in Spanish either 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.660
 if you like it or in the language that you 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.370

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.370
 let's wait for it to load 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.920
