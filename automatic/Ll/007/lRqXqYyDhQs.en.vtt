00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
well I really like it I do look a little

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.180

pale<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.420> lighting<00:02:29.750> currently<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
pale and this lighting currently but I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.339 
pale and this lighting currently but I
don't<00:02:31.579> look<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.150> way<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.690> person<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.290> I'm

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
don't look that way in person so I'm

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.740 
don't look that way in person so I'm
wondering<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:33.799> it's<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> zinc<00:02:35.420> or

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
wondering if it's because of the zinc or

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.460 
wondering if it's because of the zinc or
not<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.200> zinc<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.920> UM<00:02:38.319> titanium<00:02:39.319> dioxide

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
not the zinc but the UM titanium dioxide

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.890 
not the zinc but the UM titanium dioxide
in<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.310> that's<00:02:40.640> making<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.269> little

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
in it that's making it a little

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.710 
in it that's making it a little
flashback<00:02:42.680> II<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.280> that's<00:02:43.459> an<00:02:43.640> easy<00:02:43.760> fix<00:02:44.239> just

if you're incredibly oily you will

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.230 
if you're incredibly oily you will
probably<00:05:24.440> need<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.889> few<00:05:25.159> more<00:05:25.310> touch-ups<00:05:26.060> and

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
probably need a few more touch-ups and

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.360 
probably need a few more touch-ups and
blotting<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.750> you'll<00:05:26.930> probably<00:05:27.139> want<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.860> do

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
blotting and you'll probably want to do

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.110 
blotting and you'll probably want to do
some<00:05:28.639> sort<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.909> a<00:05:29.470> really<00:05:30.470> good<00:05:30.830> oil<00:05:31.310> absorbing

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120

some sort of a really good oil absorbing
primer<00:05:32.570> but<00:05:33.289> I<00:05:33.320> don't<00:05:33.650> think<00:05:33.919> this<00:05:34.220> would<00:05:34.520> be<00:05:34.699> a

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
primer but I don't think this would be a

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.120 
primer but I don't think this would be a
huge<00:05:35.090> problem<00:05:35.330> for<00:05:35.599> you<00:05:35.870> if<00:05:36.169> you're<00:05:36.320> super<00:05:36.710> dry
