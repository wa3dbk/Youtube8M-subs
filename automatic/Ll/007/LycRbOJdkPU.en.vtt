00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
really awkward even when you curl it I'm

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.170 
really awkward even when you curl it I'm
just<00:01:01.739> gonna<00:01:01.829> fix<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.190> few<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.489> pieces<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:03.000> well

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
and then I'm gonna proceed to curl it

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.760 
and then I'm gonna proceed to curl it
the<00:01:06.390> reason<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.020> such<00:01:07.290> layered<00:01:07.560> bangs

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the reason why I like such layered bangs

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
the reason why I like such layered bangs
is<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.579> winged<00:01:08.850> effect<00:01:09.149> when

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is so they have that winged effect when

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
is so they have that winged effect when
I<00:01:09.420> curl<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.870> and<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.800> going<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.130> again<00:01:11.310> with

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
I curl them and I'm going in again with

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.360 
I curl them and I'm going in again with
the<00:01:11.550> scissors<00:01:11.880> snip<00:01:12.840> snip<00:01:13.530> snip<00:01:13.560> snip<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:14.159> kind

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
the scissors snip snip snip snip I kind

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.620 
the scissors snip snip snip snip I kind
of<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.550> cutting<00:01:14.729> them<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.000> triangles<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
of like cutting them in triangles just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
of like cutting them in triangles just
so<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.020> don't<00:01:16.050> have<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> chop<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.130> look

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so they don't have that chop to look

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
so they don't have that chop to look
that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.610> talking<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.030> earlier<00:01:18.320> and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
like to stick together so you just got

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.210 
like to stick together so you just got
to<00:01:51.990> tell<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.260> what<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:52.830> they<00:01:53.010> will

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to tell them what to do when they will

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.920 
to tell them what to do when they will
do<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.840> one

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
do what you want them to so that one

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.330 
do what you want them to so that one
with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> wrong<00:01:58.260> way<00:01:58.409> flip<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.010> right<00:01:59.159> way

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
with the wrong way flip it the right way

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
with the wrong way flip it the right way
and<00:01:59.700> after<00:02:00.090> you'll<00:02:00.510> run<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:00.780> fingers

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and after you'll run your fingers

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.330 
and after you'll run your fingers
through<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.650> will<00:02:01.770> stay<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> way

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
through it and they will stay that way

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.600 
through it and they will stay that way
so<00:02:02.400> don't<00:02:02.700> worry<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:04.369> then<00:02:05.369> I'm<00:02:05.460> doing

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so don't worry about it then I'm doing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.789 
so don't worry about it then I'm doing
the<00:02:05.759> last<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> bottom<00:02:06.740> curling<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the last one on the bottom curling it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.710 
the last one on the bottom curling it
outwards<00:02:08.959> there<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.200> is

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
outwards there it is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.970 
outwards there it is
it's<00:02:12.080> starting<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.770> kind<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
it's starting to have that kind of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.350 
it's starting to have that kind of
winged<00:02:13.250> effect<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.820> was<00:02:13.970> talking<00:02:14.300> about

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
winged effect that I was talking about

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.330 
winged effect that I was talking about
even<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.200> bottom<00:02:15.470> layer<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> have<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:16.010> lot<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
even in the bottom layer I have a lot of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.400 
even in the bottom layer I have a lot of
hair<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.030> mine<00:02:17.480> are<00:02:17.510> typically<00:02:17.960> more<00:02:18.110> winged

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
hair so mine are typically more winged

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.610 
hair so mine are typically more winged
than<00:02:18.740> other<00:02:19.340> people's<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.090> try<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.620> but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
than other people's when they try it but

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
than other people's when they try it but
it<00:02:21.710> still<00:02:21.770> looks<00:02:21.980> good<00:02:22.100> nonetheless

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
it still looks good nonetheless

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.330 
it still looks good nonetheless
so<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:22.790> taking<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.180> next<00:02:23.390> layer<00:02:23.540> down<00:02:24.340> I'm

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so I'm taking the next layer down I'm

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
so I'm taking the next layer down I'm
gonna<00:02:25.520> pin<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> top<00:02:26.180> layer<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.810> I'm<00:02:27.140> just

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
gonna pin the top layer and I'm just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.390 
gonna pin the top layer and I'm just
going<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.410> work<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.710> middle<00:02:27.920> layer<00:02:28.070> which

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
going to work on the middle layer which

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.360 
going to work on the middle layer which
is<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.790> small<00:02:29.720> layer<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.770> an<00:02:30.860> important<00:02:31.220> one

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
is a small layer but an important one

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.510 
is a small layer but an important one
because<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.570> layers<00:02:32.990> here<00:02:33.410> I'm<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.460> to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
because we like layers here I'm going to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.600 
because we like layers here I'm going to
take<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.030> fix<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:36.080> stray<00:02:36.530> hair<00:02:36.830> that's<00:02:37.370> been

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
take that fix a stray hair that's been

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.930 
take that fix a stray hair that's been
annoying<00:02:37.850> me<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.180> whole<00:02:38.360> video<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.870> then

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
annoying me to this whole video and then

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
annoying me to this whole video and then
curl<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.060> outwards<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.660> did<00:02:41.780> before

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.120 

there<00:02:44.960> goes<00:02:45.200> went<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.530> wrong<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:45.890> make

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
there goes went the wrong way you make

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.420 
there goes went the wrong way you make
you<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> right<00:02:46.520> way<00:02:46.580> tell<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.280> go

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you go the right way tell it there we go

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.830 
you go the right way tell it there we go
that<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.240> winged<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:52.400> then<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.060> take<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.570> top

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
that is winged and then you take the top

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.280 
that is winged and then you take the top
layer<00:02:54.080> down<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.300> do<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> same<00:02:56.810> thing

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
layer down and you do the same thing

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.900 
layer down and you do the same thing
with<00:02:57.470> first<00:02:57.830> two<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:58.580> do<00:02:58.670> something

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
with first two and then you do something

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.250 
with first two and then you do something
a<00:02:59.060> little<00:02:59.240> bit<00:02:59.510> different<00:02:59.900> with<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.230> one

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
a little bit different with the one

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.730 
a little bit different with the one
that's<00:03:00.620> right<00:03:00.890> above<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:01.310> forehead<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> I'm

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
that's right above your forehead so I'm

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.410 
that's right above your forehead so I'm
curling<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.040> outwards<00:03:04.520> I'm<00:03:04.850> pulling<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.270> up

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
curling that outwards I'm pulling it up

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.330 
curling that outwards I'm pulling it up
and<00:03:05.570> away<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.290> gives<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.860> roots<00:03:07.070> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and away because it gives the roots and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.870 
and away because it gives the roots and
everything<00:03:08.090> volume<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.080> really<00:03:09.440> like

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
everything volume I really like

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.830 
everything volume I really like
voluminous<00:03:10.880> bangs<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.780> hate<00:03:12.050> flat<00:03:12.320> bangs<00:03:13.840> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
voluminous bangs I hate flat bangs and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.340 
voluminous bangs I hate flat bangs and
I'm<00:03:15.320> doing<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.680> again<00:03:16.330> there<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.570> make<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.290> go

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
I'm doing it again there is make it go

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.640 
I'm doing it again there is make it go
the<00:03:18.470> right<00:03:18.620> way<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:20.260> then<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.350> take<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
the right way and then you take this

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.010 
the right way and then you take this
first<00:03:21.860> little<00:03:22.400> piece<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.510> pull<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.780> up

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
first little piece and you pull it up

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.060 
first little piece and you pull it up
and<00:03:24.230> down<00:03:25.600> rather<00:03:26.600> than<00:03:26.750> sideways<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.980> then

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
and down rather than sideways and then

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.650 
and down rather than sideways and then
you<00:03:28.190> get<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.520> flip<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.239> ugly

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
you get this little flip this ugly

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.699 
you get this little flip this ugly
little<00:03:29.750> flip<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.230> work<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.650> little

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
little flip I work with this little

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.890 
little flip I work with this little
thing<00:03:31.100> every<00:03:31.489> single<00:03:31.610> day<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.630> kinda<00:03:32.810> look

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
thing every single day you kinda look

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.780 
thing every single day you kinda look
like<00:03:32.930> Cruella<00:03:33.230> de<00:03:33.440> Vil<00:03:33.560> for<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> second<00:03:34.340> but<00:03:34.610> you

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
like Cruella de Vil for a second but you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.340 
like Cruella de Vil for a second but you
just<00:03:34.970> pull<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.660> way<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.810> want<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> go

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
just pull it the way you want it to go

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.210 
just pull it the way you want it to go
while<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:36.800> still<00:03:37.010> hot<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.700> will<00:03:37.910> stay<00:03:39.220> so

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
while it's still hot and it will stay so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.650 
while it's still hot and it will stay so
there<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.730> there's<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.120> finished<00:03:41.450> look
