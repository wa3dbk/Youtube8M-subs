 with 4 times 3 4 ghz 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 he has a great day of 3.8 ghz 84 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.699
 watt tdp an integrated graphics unit 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.170
 the intel hd 4600 is handy for that

 ddr3 1600 and count nine is right 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.549
 fast and eight gigabytes are enough for 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 gamer loose from there still play games 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649

 maximum 2 gb ram 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.280
 and as ssd a 250gb samsung 840 euro 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.460
 it is one of the fastest on the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 ssds available on the market and 250 gb 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.509

 It is above average 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.150
 fast hard disk and 2 terabytes 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 should be thick for most of you 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.640
 suffice 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.580
 as graphics card the 2 gb gb geforce gtx 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.890
 770 ossi she is gigabit typical 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 overclocked and has the big windforce 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.570
 3x cooler of up to 450 watts of heat 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
 can dissipate 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.290
 then almost all games should open 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.020
 the highest settings with 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.840

 cell is free and as well 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.390
 power supply 1 480 watts be quite straight 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.230
 power e9 with 480 watts has a bit 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.330
 air upward 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.650
 it is modular that means you can do that 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
 You do not lose the cables anymore 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.060
 so they do not need to be unnecessary 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.490
 in the housing around and 80 plus gold is 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.070
 very energy saving then a dvd 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.950
 burner from samsung and as housing 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.810
 wreck part the faina four midi-tower it 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.970
 is a slightly worse elegant 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 housing but of course was allowed itself 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.780
 decide which want to take housing 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.310
