00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.099
 for the horse and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
 I remember there when I had some 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.870
 12 years I bought a mare that in the year 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.549
 30 thousand pesos was a lot of money I never 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.549
 I thought I was going to pay yesterday 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.569
 and from there we went to the horses 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.610
 of ldl my brother also had his 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.610
 mare that my mom bought in a round 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.490
 when violence is no longer there in the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.090
 town and everything and we were leaving 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:50.490
 there and I started in Medellin with a gift 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.550

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.610

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.610

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.210
 I started to take care of early morning a lot 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.180
 look after the kind horses of three of the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.710
 three and a half morning I got up for 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.300

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.230
 helped to get ahead with the rope 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.150
 and then the boy got out of the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.909
 rope and they left that charge to me 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 and led him to become the lamb 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.640
 of fame and the lamb of the time when 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.950
 I remember those times of a failure 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.780

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.390

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.970
