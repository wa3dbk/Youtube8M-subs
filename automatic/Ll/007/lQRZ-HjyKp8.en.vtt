of the collection is frozen blueberry

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
of the collection is frozen blueberry
and<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.680> didn't<00:03:29.010> expect<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.240> would<00:03:30.360> like

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and I didn't expect that I would like

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
and I didn't expect that I would like
the<00:03:30.930> more<00:03:31.200> metallic<00:03:31.590> finishes<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.580> best<00:03:32.850> but

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
the more metallic finishes the best but

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.970 
the more metallic finishes the best but
I've<00:03:33.480> never<00:03:33.660> had<00:03:33.990> anything<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.620> before

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160 
I've never had anything like this before
so<00:03:35.459> maybe<00:03:35.610> that's<00:03:35.970> why<00:03:36.240> I<00:03:36.270> really<00:03:36.600> love<00:03:36.930> these

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
