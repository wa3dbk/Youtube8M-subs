00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.860
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.670
 It is no opponent Kedomo is so I lyrics is was strong 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.450
 a squad'm struck with a place that could be called from the front 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.450
 Is it done 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:23.230
 Bover was overturned and it was easy 4 ps arro 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:29.150
 It can be done before even if you are a little bit 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:36.069
 Campaign toast bread Perth Wacky al. 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.069
 I wanted to notice just by writing 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:59.610
 Boo Boo s Shih Noon Noon 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.730
 I want to really go the placement it is a place that can be seen painted 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.140
 Speaking of the next Niigata Sendai 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.799
 Well may I somehow it's a bad house flow that there not be the win if 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.850
 Because there is a nature of intervening , if you are not a little bit, ask 3 staff members 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.030
 but 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:21.060
 After all, if you want to put aside about Atsushi, the documents and the Bible , this exercise and a long time 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 I had to spend some time , but I think it was painful here 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.550
 8 The first half was defeated 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.250
 Iketeeee to very aggressive 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.270
 Though I was in a good flow What if there is such a place where eating from the middle to the update path 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.670
 It is I thought Na's Kachotto and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:47.950
 Two curve the way from the middle that get in the right place where the other party has become in Kashima's referee 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:52.630
 There was there, but it came to me there, but I felt it was the middle and I felt it 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.569
 It may be located in the place that say well no longer go from the front where momentum is severe 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.040
 A little give up a good thing I'm not even from the front 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:07.400
 Also I had to or shift to the dog hobby does Mase Tarawakari was forced to shift 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:11.720
 It is done well from there, and the end is the number top which is meaningless again and there is not everything. 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:16.340
 It is strong and Dema tea to produce a place called Exit 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:22.610
 Mr. Higuchi has always been wondering what to do when it is met 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.350
 The place where you can't see how you can't see what you do is a bit radical 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.600
 I need to know someone 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.710
 Square to the next because I did not think that losing streak in such severe kana and No way this timing 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.910
 There is also a partner who is easy to discuss 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.780
 I just want to avoid that three consecutive defeats somehow 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.780
 I will go to Niigata too 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.520
 It was a stunning defeat 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.550
 that 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.860
 First of all, m 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:55.820
 Well if I say where I was concerned about judgment 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:05:00.710
 For play that raised the leg to the height of the opponent's head 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.360
 Steak or a wish I want you to neatly N Byun because I do not blow a turn dangerous 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.730
 If you really care , it is there 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.020
 8 out twice or three times it does not have standing was'm out of foul I was not from 2 game 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:16.520
 I bought it, though 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:22.110
 I thought that I thought that the game without influence would be diuretic and that the cold storage director was wonderful 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.470
 I really think you say after all is my first half of the Kobayashi of the card was heard last 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:45.490
 It 's about asking if you want to give a range etc. 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:51.910
 Oh wildebeest 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:58.900
 When was true or rather superimposed intraoperative brilliantly runs I Hama of child actually to say oh if me 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:06:01.639
 After all I wanted to lower Nakamachi quickly and buy it there, but put this one in that case 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.630
 Nde was not enough one at the end 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.580
 There was no time to change 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.280
 I really regret it 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:18.350
 It is already a wonderful toast yeah yeah 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.350
 I think that I want you to do it one more time in Aim E-mail mediocre 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.350
 Hmm
