00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
storyline of the world that you're in so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.580 
storyline of the world that you're in so
for<00:01:46.270> example<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.260> Alice<00:01:47.530> in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
for example this this is Alice in

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590 
for example this this is Alice in
Wonderland<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.280> we're<00:01:48.460> solving<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.450> puzzle

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
Wonderland so we're solving a puzzle

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.740 
Wonderland so we're solving a puzzle
that<00:01:49.900> has<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.170> do<00:01:50.290> with<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:51.430> card<00:01:51.700> pieces<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
that has to do with the card pieces the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:10.100 
that has to do with the card pieces the
symbols

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.550 

so<00:02:10.619> now<00:02:10.770> we've<00:02:10.950> opened<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.110> other<00:02:13.110> area

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so now we've opened up the other area

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
so now we've opened up the other area
here<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.900> maze<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:21.270> level<00:02:21.660> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
here and this is the maze this level is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.400 
here and this is the maze this level is
really<00:02:21.870> cool

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
really cool

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.620 
really cool
this<00:02:22.890> level<00:02:23.130> adapts<00:02:23.700> itself<00:02:24.000> according<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
this level adapts itself according to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.780 
this level adapts itself according to
however<00:02:24.960> many<00:02:25.170> players<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.580> I'm

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
however many players you have so I'm

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.450 
however many players you have so I'm
playing<00:02:27.060> by<00:02:27.210> myself<00:02:27.390> right<00:02:27.780> now

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
playing by myself right now

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.050 
playing by myself right now
so<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.260> puzzle<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.980> only<00:02:32.280> set<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:34.790> work<00:02:35.790> for

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
so the puzzle is only set up to work for

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:48.630 
so the puzzle is only set up to work for
one<00:02:36.240> person

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.550 

so<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.820> switches<00:02:50.330> are<00:02:50.360> are<00:02:50.870> timed<00:02:51.290> right

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
so these switches are are timed right

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.500 
so these switches are are timed right
now<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.190> was<00:02:52.370> playing<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:52.700> more

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
now and if I was playing with more

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.290 
now and if I was playing with more
players<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:55.100> would<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.460> such<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.940> one

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
players then it would be such that one

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.730 
players then it would be such that one
person<00:02:56.660> would<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.990> stand<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.500> switch

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
person would have to stand on the switch

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.940 
person would have to stand on the switch
and<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.160> other<00:02:58.280> players<00:02:58.850> would<00:02:59.150> have<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and the other players would have to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:16.380 
and the other players would have to
negotiate

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.010 

so<00:03:17.050> as<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.260> mentioned<00:03:17.680> there<00:03:18.420> starts<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.600> 40

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so as I mentioned there starts with 40

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.660 
so as I mentioned there starts with 40
plus<00:03:20.290> costumes<00:03:20.860> but<00:03:21.070> there's<00:03:21.280> going<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.490> be<00:03:21.580> a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
plus costumes but there's going to be a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.090 
plus costumes but there's going to be a
robust<00:03:22.150> downloadable<00:03:22.960> content<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.890> going

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
robust downloadable content that's going

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.620 
robust downloadable content that's going
to<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.280> available<00:03:24.490> for<00:03:24.730> purchase<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.480> that's

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
to be available for purchase and that's

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.990 
to be available for purchase and that's
going<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.900> be<00:03:26.020> released<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:27.340> monthly

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
going to be released on monthly

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:50.640 
going to be released on monthly
intervals

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.369 

as<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.489> see<00:03:51.700> I'm<00:03:51.819> using<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.180> bomb<00:03:52.510> there

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
as you can see I'm using the bomb there

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.080 
as you can see I'm using the bomb there
are<00:03:53.560> destructible<00:03:54.370> pieces<00:03:54.819> of<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
are destructible pieces of the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
are destructible pieces of the
environment

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.570 

and<00:04:08.610> as<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> enemies<00:04:09.900> will

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
and as you can see the enemies will

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.030 
and as you can see the enemies will
rebuild<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:12.240> puzzle<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.050> obstacle<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.830> if

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
rebuild the puzzle the obstacle so if

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.280 
rebuild the puzzle the obstacle so if
you've<00:04:14.220> cleared<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:14.730> if<00:04:14.910> it's<00:04:15.780> probably<00:04:16.200> not

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
you've cleared it if it's probably not

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.580 
you've cleared it if it's probably not
good<00:04:16.530> enough<00:04:16.770> because<00:04:16.950> they'll<00:04:17.310> rebuild<00:04:17.550> it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
good enough because they'll rebuild it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.810 
good enough because they'll rebuild it
so<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.680> might<00:04:19.830> have<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.160> some<00:04:20.340> things<00:04:20.580> over

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
so you might have to do some things over

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.280 
so you might have to do some things over
again<00:04:21.710> adds<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.070> challenge<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.050> need<00:04:25.200> to

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
again adds to the challenge so I need to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:41.820 
again adds to the challenge so I need to
go<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> way<00:04:25.650> back<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:26.040> here

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.980 

and<00:04:42.310> then<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:42.759> have<00:04:42.940> one<00:04:43.090> left<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.870> get

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
and then I just have one left to get

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:55.740 
and then I just have one left to get
this<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.530> Spade

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.940 

again<00:04:56.350> we're<00:04:56.500> going<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.710> use<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.980> bomb<00:04:57.190> to

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
again we're going to use the bomb to

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.950 
again we're going to use the bomb to
move<00:04:59.950> one<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.910> destructible<00:05:01.510> pieces<00:05:01.840> of

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
move one of the destructible pieces of

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.810 
move one of the destructible pieces of
the<00:05:02.020> environment

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.870 

so<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.390> just<00:05:08.720> went<00:05:09.620> across<00:05:09.950> one<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.670> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
so I just went across one of the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.730 
so I just went across one of the
power-ups<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:12.050> they're<00:05:12.290> all<00:05:12.500> pretty

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
power-ups and they're all pretty

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.140 
power-ups and they're all pretty
irreverent<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.690> they<00:05:14.890> vary<00:05:15.890> greatly<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.670> just

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
irreverent and they vary greatly I just

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:32.380 
irreverent and they vary greatly I just
was<00:05:17.330> turned<00:05:17.570> into<00:05:17.720> a<00:05:17.840> jackhammer

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.760 

so<00:05:33.390> that<00:05:33.630> completes<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.230> Alice<00:05:34.710> in

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
so that completes the Alice in

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.950 
so that completes the Alice in
Wonderland<00:05:34.830> level<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.960> the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
Wonderland level and that is the

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.320 
Wonderland level and that is the
conclusion<00:05:40.350> of<00:05:40.590> this<00:05:40.770> part<00:05:41.040> so<00:05:41.400> thanks<00:05:42.240> for

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
conclusion of this part so thanks for
