 species of islets with each type of 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.509
 biome around here we see this they have for 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.909
 here pumpkins of the jungle that here 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.119

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.090
 everything all everything here we can see what 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.459
 are the passive mods in this kind of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.920
 Cay that are the champ and cow 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.129

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.989
 ocelots that are here and if we come 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.930
 On this side we can see that there is 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.510
 portal very well the portal and here are 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.250
 these the offspring of the different 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.860
 trees here how would it look like 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.870
 supports the lens 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.800
 and what they are they turned the yards of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.660
 would be these 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.830
 and if we come down here this too 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.850
 I loved it, it's kind of like 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.890
 gallery here we can see the zombies 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.930

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.840
 over here what is the archer here 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.230
 we have the spider 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.290
 here we have the zombie big man for this 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.080
 side continues what is the review of 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.300
 the mods the most hostile here we have 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.870
 to the lenderman out there we see it is like 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.090
 that got there so it does not escape 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.310
 here that we have more matthew than not 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.340

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 the slide also disappeared but good 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.910
 this is where they would be here we have in 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.819
 what is the silver fish and here what 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.769
 that is the place and nothing the truth that 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.829
 this system, I liked it a lot 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.459
 Much is very complete is for the 0.12 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.459
 Of course 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.700
 and I do not know from the craters because in 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.099
 I really like the download 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.989
 as always is in the description that 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.970
 this map is in the universe itself and 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.379
 it does not stop raining for god but good 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.030
 also even the particles of the 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.500
 rain are of the texture so it's 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.300
 who will carry this texture that is 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.920
 like medieval style 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.570
 the video of the download is in the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.730
 description so I do not expect anything 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.590
 have liked and see you in a following 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.200

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.709
 little chick hanging around endlessly 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.709
 publicized goodbye
