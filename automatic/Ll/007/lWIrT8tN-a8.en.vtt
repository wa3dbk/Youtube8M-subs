you how to use this to diagnose your car
and<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> problems<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.740> might<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.980> having<00:00:14.160> so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and the problems you might be having so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.279 
and the problems you might be having so
all<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> put<00:00:15.750> your<00:00:15.839> key<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
all we have to do is put your key in the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.070 
all we have to do is put your key in the
ignition<00:00:16.880> turn<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> run<00:00:18.420> position<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
ignition turn it to the run position and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
ignition turn it to the run position and
if<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> problem<00:00:20.330> it'll<00:00:21.330> let<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.600> know

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
if you have a problem it'll let you know

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.200 
if you have a problem it'll let you know
this<00:00:22.080> will<00:00:22.289> start<00:00:22.529> flashing<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this will start flashing so you have to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
this will start flashing so you have to
give<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> couple<00:00:24.630> seconds<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.289> also

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
give it a couple seconds you can also

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
give it a couple seconds you can also
start<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.890> car<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> run<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.519> car<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
start your car and run your car and this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.169 
start your car and run your car and this
will<00:00:27.539> start<00:00:27.689> flashing<00:00:27.869> faster<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> can

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
will start flashing faster but you can

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
will start flashing faster but you can
see<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.019> started<00:00:31.380> flashing<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.550> what

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
see that started flashing so now what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.700 
see that started flashing so now what
you<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> hold<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> fan<00:00:34.110> buttons<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you do is you hold the fan buttons the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
you do is you hold the fan buttons the
up<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.160> fan<00:00:35.399> buttons<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.780> five

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
up and down fan buttons down for five

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
up and down fan buttons down for five
seconds<00:00:37.520> three<00:00:38.540> four<00:00:39.540> five<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.040> pops<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.550> on

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
seconds three four five that pops up on

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
seconds three four five that pops up on
the<00:00:41.700> screen<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.140> hit<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the screen and then you just hit the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.430 
the screen and then you just hit the
auto<00:00:43.559> button<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.280> auto<00:00:44.489> fan<00:00:44.700> button<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
auto button the auto fan button and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
auto button the auto fan button and
that'll<00:00:46.440> give<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> code<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that'll give you the code of what is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020 
that'll give you the code of what is
wrong<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.250> I'm<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> go<00:00:50.670> show<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> what

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
wrong and I'm going to go show you what

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
wrong and I'm going to go show you what
the<00:00:51.300> codes<00:00:51.510> mean<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.649> basically

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the codes mean right now so basically

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
the codes mean right now so basically
what<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> check<00:00:54.300> engine

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
what this is is like a check engine

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
what this is is like a check engine
light<00:00:54.660> except<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.500> air<00:00:55.620> conditioning

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
light except for your air conditioning

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
light except for your air conditioning
system<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.570> codes<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
system so here are the different codes I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
system so here are the different codes I
have<00:00:58.890> three<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.210> outside<00:01:00.750> air

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
have three which is the outside air

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
have three which is the outside air
temperature<00:01:01.469> sensor<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.210> says<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
temperature sensor so it says the the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
temperature sensor so it says the the
circuit<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> open<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
circuit is open so that means the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.020 
circuit is open so that means the
connector<00:01:07.020> probably<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.439> disconnected<00:01:08.030> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
connector probably got disconnected so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.530 
connector probably got disconnected so
let's<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.780> fix<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:14.540> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
let's go see if we can fix that now so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
let's go see if we can fix that now so
the<00:01:15.869> connection<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:19.159> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the connection is going to be on this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.130 
the connection is going to be on this
side<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:21.600> looking<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
side so what we're looking for is the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
side so what we're looking for is the
air<00:01:22.290> temperature<00:01:22.740> sensor<00:01:22.909> if<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.150> under

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
air temperature sensor if we go under

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.960 
air temperature sensor if we go under
the<00:01:24.509> car<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.820> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the car and look in here you see this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.440 
the car and look in here you see this
right<00:01:27.180> here

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
right here

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
right here
that<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> air<00:01:29.100> temperature<00:01:29.490> sensor

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that that's the air temperature sensor

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.980 
that that's the air temperature sensor
and<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.060> does<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.869> you're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and what it does is it when you're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
and what it does is it when you're
moving<00:01:31.110> forward<00:01:31.549> it'll<00:01:32.549> calculate<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
moving forward it'll calculate the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
moving forward it'll calculate the
temperature<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> air<00:01:34.200> based<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
temperature of the air based on a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.789 
temperature of the air based on a
resistor<00:01:35.909> that's<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.439> sensor

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
resistor that's in here that sensor

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.620 
resistor that's in here that sensor
could<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.040> bad<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.759> think<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
could be bad but I just think it it's a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.010 
could be bad but I just think it it's a
connector<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> came<00:01:40.320> loose<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.780> here's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
connector that came loose and so here's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
connector that came loose and so here's
the<00:01:43.110> connector<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.220> oh<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the connector right back here oh and as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.179 
the connector right back here oh and as
you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.369> connector<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> loose<00:01:48.060> which

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
you can see the connector is loose which

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.609 
you can see the connector is loose which
nice<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> simple<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:51.149> connect<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.200> we'll

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
nice and simple will connect it so we'll

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.080 
nice and simple will connect it so we'll
just<00:01:52.649> snap<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:54.930> clicks<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:56.090> that's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
just snap that in it clicks good that's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
just snap that in it clicks good that's
in<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:58.799> we'll<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.460> fix

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in there so now we'll go see if that fix

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
in there so now we'll go see if that fix
the<00:01:59.790> problem<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> say<00:02:01.469> there's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the problem so it's going to say there's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.499 
the problem so it's going to say there's
still<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.979> problem<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.119> has<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.420> be

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
still a problem because it has to be

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
still a problem because it has to be
cycled<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.649> way<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> gets<00:02:05.130> cycled<00:02:05.369> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
cycled and the way this gets cycled is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
cycled and the way this gets cycled is
when<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> car<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> running<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.170> it's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
when the car is running I think it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.130 
when the car is running I think it's
about<00:02:07.799> 15<00:02:08.340> miles<00:02:08.580> per<00:02:08.700> hour<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.959> thirty

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
about 15 miles per hour for for thirty

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.710 
about 15 miles per hour for for thirty
seconds<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.739> it'll<00:02:11.670> try<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> air

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
seconds and it'll try to get the air

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
seconds and it'll try to get the air
temperature<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
temperature so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.960 
temperature so
I'm<00:02:13.950> gonna<00:02:14.070> do<00:02:14.220> right<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.790> I'm<00:02:14.880> gonna

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I'm gonna do right now and I'm gonna

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.380 
I'm gonna do right now and I'm gonna
come<00:02:15.210> back<00:02:22.130> okay<00:02:23.130> well<00:02:23.460> we're<00:02:23.790> moving<00:02:23.910> forward

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
come back okay well we're moving forward

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.970 
come back okay well we're moving forward
for<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.630> think<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:24.930> 10<00:02:25.230> seconds<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.740> wasn't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
for I think it was 10 seconds it wasn't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.390 
for I think it was 10 seconds it wasn't
even<00:02:26.040> 15<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.450> shut<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.750> off<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.980> problem

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
even 15 and it shut right off so problem

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.750 
even 15 and it shut right off so problem
solved

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 

so<00:02:33.360> some<00:02:33.659> of<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.870> might<00:02:34.019> know<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.379> do<00:02:34.680> that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so some of you might know how to do that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.290 
so some of you might know how to do that
there's<00:02:35.129> also<00:02:35.310> another<00:02:35.519> trick<00:02:35.849> that's<00:02:36.090> pretty

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
there's also another trick that's pretty

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.250 
there's also another trick that's pretty
cool<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.659> you're<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.110> same

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
cool and you're going to do the same

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
cool and you're going to do the same
thing<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.799> hold<00:02:38.010> down<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.430> up-and-down<00:02:38.940> fan

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
thing you hold down the up-and-down fan

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.839 
thing you hold down the up-and-down fan
buttons<00:02:39.989> for<00:02:40.500> five<00:02:40.650> seconds<00:02:41.129> till<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> screen

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
buttons for five seconds till the screen

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.300 
buttons for five seconds till the screen
changes<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.720> double<00:02:42.989> O's<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.379> now<00:02:44.250> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
changes to the double O's and now you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.920 
changes to the double O's and now you
could<00:02:44.549> go<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> change<00:02:45.060> through<00:02:45.540> different

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
could go and change through different

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.470 
could go and change through different
parameters<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> table<00:02:48.090> here

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
parameters so I have a table here

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.320 
parameters so I have a table here
there's<00:02:48.840> different<00:02:49.049> parameters<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.760> for

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
there's different parameters here so for

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.490 
there's different parameters here so for
example<00:02:52.040> let's<00:02:53.040> look<00:02:53.129> at<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> cool<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:54.500> vehicle

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
example let's look at a cool one vehicle

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.550 
example let's look at a cool one vehicle
speed<00:02:55.799> number<00:02:56.489> seven<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:58.230> go

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
speed number seven so now we just go

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.130 
speed number seven so now we just go
here<00:03:02.000> number<00:03:03.000> seven<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:03.629> we<00:03:03.720> hit<00:03:03.870> Auto

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
here number seven and then we hit Auto

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.190 
here number seven and then we hit Auto
fan<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.120> then<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> vehicle<00:03:06.690> speed<00:03:06.930> will<00:03:07.019> show

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
fan and then a vehicle speed will show

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:18.199 
fan and then a vehicle speed will show
up<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.530> I'll<00:03:07.590> show<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.860> right<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:17.209> so

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
up and I'll show you that right now so

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.300 
up and I'll show you that right now so
you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.629> you<00:03:19.049> can<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.319> your<00:03:19.530> speedometer

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you can see you can get your speedometer

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.430 
you can see you can get your speedometer
on<00:03:20.400> there<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:21.180> says<00:03:21.329> I'm<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.599> 15<00:03:22.079> miles<00:03:22.290> an

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
on there it says I'm going 15 miles an

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.699 
on there it says I'm going 15 miles an
hour<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.359> out<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.840> parameter<00:03:25.170> such<00:03:25.560> as

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
hour to get out of a parameter such as

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.830 
hour to get out of a parameter such as
the<00:03:25.799> vehicle<00:03:26.099> speed<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:27.000> hit<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.329> auto<00:03:27.599> fan

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
the vehicle speed just hit the auto fan

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
the vehicle speed just hit the auto fan
button<00:03:28.140> again<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.500> let's<00:03:29.459> check<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.849> another

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
button again and let's check out another

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.099 
button again and let's check out another
one<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.660> cool<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.220> coolant<00:03:32.819> temp<00:03:33.109> but

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
one a cool one here is coolant temp but

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.140 
one a cool one here is coolant temp but
this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.560> degrees<00:03:34.890> Celsius<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.970> we're

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
this is in degrees Celsius so we're

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.550 
this is in degrees Celsius so we're
going<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> go<00:03:36.480> look<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:36.959> number<00:03:37.169> 16<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:40.530> going

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
going to go look for number 16 I'm going

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.610 
going to go look for number 16 I'm going
to<00:03:40.709> hit<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.040> fan<00:03:41.310> button<00:03:42.260> 101<00:03:43.260> degrees

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
to hit the fan button 101 degrees

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.379 
to hit the fan button 101 degrees
Celsius<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:44.819> I'm<00:03:44.910> going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> look<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.299> my

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
Celsius now I'm going to look at my

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.370 
Celsius now I'm going to look at my
gauges<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.250> that's<00:03:47.250> oil<00:03:47.579> temperature

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
gauges here that's oil temperature

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.339 
gauges here that's oil temperature
coolant<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.859> 15<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:51.299> Fahrenheit<00:03:51.840> 212

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
coolant to 15 that's Fahrenheit 212

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.370 
coolant to 15 that's Fahrenheit 212
Fahrenheit<00:03:52.470> boiling<00:03:53.190> 100<00:03:54.180> Celsius<00:03:55.169> is

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
Fahrenheit boiling 100 Celsius is

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.349 
Fahrenheit boiling 100 Celsius is
boiling<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.269> 215<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.799> 102<00:03:58.799> degrees<00:03:59.370> Celsius<00:03:59.849> so

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
boiling so 215 is 102 degrees Celsius so

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.270 
boiling so 215 is 102 degrees Celsius so
that's<00:04:00.540> that's<00:04:00.959> pretty<00:04:01.139> cool<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.709> there's<00:04:02.220> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
that's that's pretty cool and there's a
