magic for Wow almost 18 years now and my
it<00:00:42.810> sort<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> shifted<00:00:43.560> so<00:00:43.830> when<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> turned<00:00:44.310> 18

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it sort of shifted so when I turned 18

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.460 
it sort of shifted so when I turned 18
my<00:00:44.970> dad<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.540> hypnotized<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> quit

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470

smoking<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.580> me

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
smoking and to me

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
smoking and to me
that<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.660> almost<00:00:48.780> real<00:00:49.170> magic<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:49.740> thought<00:00:49.950> if

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that was almost real magic I thought if

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
that was almost real magic I thought if
you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.700> change<00:00:50.940> someone's<00:00:51.240> life<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.810> mean

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you can change someone's life I mean

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.450 
you can change someone's life I mean
that's<00:00:52.350> wow<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that's wow that's something and so I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.680 
that's wow that's something and so I
started<00:00:53.790> studying<00:00:53.910> body<00:00:54.330> language

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
started studying body language

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
started studying body language
psychology<00:00:55.230> suggestion<00:00:55.770> hypnosis<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
psychology suggestion hypnosis and it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
psychology suggestion hypnosis and it
really<00:00:57.060> changed<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> direction<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.380> my

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really changed the direction that my

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.930 
really changed the direction that my
performances<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.220> go<00:00:59.310> for<00:00:59.490> the<00:00:59.550> next<00:00:59.700> 12

and then right I did and I thought very
much<00:02:57.989> about<00:02:58.140> staying<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.220> hand<00:02:59.640> but<00:02:59.849> I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
much about staying with one hand but I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.979 
much about staying with one hand but I
thought<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.150> was<00:03:00.330> too<00:03:00.450> predictable

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
thought that was too predictable

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.720 
thought that was too predictable
so<00:03:01.170> I'm<00:03:01.380> predictable<00:03:02.099> that's<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.370> funny<00:03:02.549> word

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
so I'm predictable that's a funny word

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.280 
so I'm predictable that's a funny word
you<00:03:03.030> know<00:03:03.150> cuz<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.630> money's<00:03:03.870> been<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
you know cuz the money's been out the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.390 
you know cuz the money's been out the
whole<00:03:04.410> time<00:03:04.590> an<00:03:04.769> interesting<00:03:05.069> thing<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.310> on

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
whole time an interesting thing is on

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.320 
whole time an interesting thing is on
the<00:03:05.489> back<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.640> wrote<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.910> little<00:03:06.060> note

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the back I wrote a little note

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.880 
the back I wrote a little note
no<00:03:06.840> one<00:03:06.930> should<00:03:07.049> actually<00:03:07.200> read<00:03:07.470> out<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.799> it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
no one should actually read out what it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.240 
no one should actually read out what it
says<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.580> will<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.819> right<00:03:09.090> left<00:03:09.420> right<00:03:09.599> ah

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.880 

that's<00:03:16.560> what<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.100> did<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:19.140> those<00:03:19.290> choices<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
that's what it did so those choices that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.890 
that's what it did so those choices that
we<00:03:20.040> make<00:03:20.310> right<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.209> question<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.870> know

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
we make right the question is you know

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.300 
we make right the question is you know
can<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.260> really<00:03:22.500> read<00:03:22.799> minds<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.250> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
can you really read minds can you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.830 
can you really read minds can you
predict<00:03:23.609> actions<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.750> know

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
predict actions the thing is you know

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.150 
predict actions the thing is you know
people<00:03:25.109> say<00:03:25.260> oh<00:03:25.290> why<00:03:25.560> don't<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.769> play<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.069 
people say oh why don't you play the
lottery<00:03:26.190> right<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.209> can't<00:03:27.750> predict<00:03:28.019> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
lottery right I can't predict the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.110 
lottery right I can't predict the
actions<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.440> machines<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.370> people

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
actions of machines you know people

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.759 
actions of machines you know people
that's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.600> very<00:03:30.870> different<00:03:31.200> thing<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.680> way

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
that's a very different thing the way

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.080 
that's a very different thing the way
that<00:03:31.920> we're<00:03:32.010> wired<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.370> way<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:32.700> respond

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that we're wired the way that we respond

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.360 
that we're wired the way that we respond
to<00:03:33.420> very<00:03:33.600> simple<00:03:33.930> verbal<00:03:34.260> cues<00:03:34.530> these<00:03:35.040> kinds

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
to very simple verbal cues these kinds

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.500 
to very simple verbal cues these kinds
of<00:03:35.430> things<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.180> explored
