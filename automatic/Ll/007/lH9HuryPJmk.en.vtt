00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 in bars or parties you should never miss 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.660
 the snack the problem is that they are 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 too industrialized and they are very 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.849
 bad for your health stay to see this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.650
 video so that you learn to make a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.340
 inexpensive and natural rich botanita 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.250
 Y 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.220
 If you buy a package of fried foods and see 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.730
 all the ingredients that contain you 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.920
 you will surprise everything you see all 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.770
 these are the ingredients that have most 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 called my attention in a few toritos and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.600
 basically they are food additives 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.140
 canned that cause you the sensation 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.650
 of wanting to eat more and more and so you 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.080
 they generate a problem of overweight without 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.110
 forget to consume glutamate 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.829
 monosodium has side effects that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 can change in each individual as 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.829
 burning in the arms headache 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.989
 pressures on the face among many others 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.070
 tartrazine which is a yellow dye 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.570
 that causes hyperactivity in children 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.390
 drowsiness allergies and of course 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.149
 Obesity and in adults causes allergies 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.060
 as urticaria asthma rhinitis among others 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.580
 one more reason not to consume this type 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.530
 of chips is the price since it has been 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.340
 very high costing 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 approximately 19 pesos for only 155 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.180
 grams 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 the good news starts as you 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.690
 you can prepare your own snacks just 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.900
 We need 2 to 3 corn tortillas 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 40 grams of oil and 50 grams of chili 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.610
 piquin let's cut the tortilla in 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.520
 triangles and then we're going to heat the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.710
 oil and when it is very hot 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.320
 we submerged tortillas in it until 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.050
 they are golden, we put them in a 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 paper that absorbs fat and while 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.280
 we hope we sprinkle the chili and ready 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.410
 for 155 grams of doritos 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.259
 industrialized the paid 19 pesos and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.960
 for 150 grams of my homemade doritos 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.960
 natural pay 4 pesos 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.290
 the most notorious differences is that 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.380
 two industrial rites have a slight 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.790
 smell the sock while the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.220
 natural doritos smell like chile los 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.330
 industrials have a red color 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 intense almost radioactive and the landlords 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.470
 a dark coffee 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.630
 we will start with doritos 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 industrial 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.159
 they're supposed to be too spicy and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.290
 they do not sting so if it comes it's a flavor 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:02.930
 strong to lemon at another point they do not know to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:08.170
 tortilla and they are a little crispy 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.170
 now we go with our beautiful landlords 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.260
 these doritos pica itches a lot for me 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.080
 and another point is that they leave you the flavor 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.380
 rich tortilla in the mouth and they are more 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.670
 crunchy than the others 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.420
 I hope you try to make your own 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.070
 botana since it is richer and more natural and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.280
 tell me in the comments 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.560
