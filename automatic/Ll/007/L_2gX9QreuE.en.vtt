00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
space because we tend to use these sites

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.889 
space because we tend to use these sites
so<00:00:48.920> much<00:00:49.070> more<00:00:49.280> than<00:00:49.579> that's<00:00:50.269> right<00:00:50.570> i<00:00:50.629> mean

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
so much more than that's right i mean

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.950 
so much more than that's right i mean
you<00:00:51.230> know<00:00:51.879> Kim<00:00:52.879> didn't<00:00:53.120> say<00:00:53.269> how<00:00:53.449> old<00:00:53.660> she<00:00:53.929> is

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
you know Kim didn't say how old she is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.569 
you know Kim didn't say how old she is
not<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:54.469> expect<00:00:54.829> her<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.100> women<00:00:55.429> don't

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
not that we expect her to women don't

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.189 
not that we expect her to women don't
like<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.789> reveal<00:00:56.090> their<00:00:56.239> age<00:00:56.420> but<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:56.780> mean<00:00:56.989> it

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
like to reveal their age but I mean it

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.959 
like to reveal their age but I mean it
does<00:00:57.440> seem<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.010> younger<00:00:58.250> generation

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
does seem that the younger generation

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.240 
does seem that the younger generation
and<00:00:59.239> those<00:00:59.449> younger<00:00:59.839> business<00:01:00.379> owners<00:01:00.920> are

and those younger business owners are

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.540 
and those younger business owners are
more<00:01:01.609> apt<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.059> know<00:01:02.300> how<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.660> use<00:01:02.870> online<00:01:03.620> so

it<00:01:13.610> even<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.910> good<00:01:14.060> move<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.570> think<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.140> really

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
it even a good move I think it really

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 
it even a good move I think it really
can<00:01:15.800> be<00:01:15.830> good<00:01:16.010> for<00:01:16.220> any<00:01:16.430> company<00:01:16.790> there's<00:01:17.180> so

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
can be good for any company there's so

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.000 
can be good for any company there's so
much<00:01:17.480> opportunity<00:01:17.660> there<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.740> thing<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:18.980> keep

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
much opportunity there the thing to keep

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.280 
much opportunity there the thing to keep
in<00:01:19.220> mind<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:20.420> new<00:01:20.630> social<00:01:20.990> media

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
in mind is that this new social media

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.900 
in mind is that this new social media
and<00:01:21.470> social<00:01:21.590> networks<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.190> very<00:01:22.490> different<00:01:22.700> to

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
and social networks is very different to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.270 
and social networks is very different to
traditional<00:01:23.600> media<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.530> therefore<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.130> need

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
traditional media so therefore you need

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.520 
traditional media so therefore you need
some<00:01:25.520> very<00:01:25.610> different<00:01:26.030> approaches<00:01:26.500> well<00:01:27.500> I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
some very different approaches well I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.870 
some very different approaches well I
think<00:01:27.920> there's<00:01:28.160> something<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.460> seventy

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
think there's something like seventy

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.940 
think there's something like seventy
percent<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.300> us<00:01:29.810> teens<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.530> social<00:01:30.890> networks

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
percent of us teens in social networks

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.300 
percent of us teens in social networks
now<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:31.760> not<00:01:32.180> only<00:01:32.390> teamed<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.170> all<00:01:33.350> people

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
now it's not only teamed it's all people

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.770 
now it's not only teamed it's all people
all<00:01:34.430> across<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.820> US<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.480> world<00:01:35.600> of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
all across the US and the world of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.840 
all across the US and the world of
course<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:36.310> who<00:01:37.310> are<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:37.520> these<00:01:37.640> communities

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
course I who are in these communities

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.330 
course I who are in these communities
and<00:01:38.750> then<00:01:38.930> put<00:01:39.080> together<00:01:39.350> by<00:01:39.530> common<00:01:39.950> interest

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and then put together by common interest

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.920 
and then put together by common interest
so<00:01:40.790> rather<00:01:41.180> than<00:01:41.270> age<00:01:41.540> rather<00:01:41.840> than

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
so rather than age rather than

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.420 
so rather than age rather than
demographics<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:42.770> really<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.010> world<00:01:43.280> of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
demographics it's really a world of

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.400
