00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.670
 ok in a previous video we talked a little 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.160
 of what Faraday's law was and it 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.339
 established that Faraday's law has 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 helped calculate an induced sen and 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.410
 this was equal to the negative of the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.760
 derivative 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.500
 of the magnetic flux with respect to time 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 so we calculate the induced and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 we said that this less that is here 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.480
 it depends on what is known as the law 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.239
 of links 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.430
 we will explain where it originates 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.510
 this - that is here several examples 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.360
 practical 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.600
 then let's talk about the law of lentz 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.079
 suppose that these two turns 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.320
 vein and are circular wires 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.839
 both cases there is a magnetic field 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.469
 variable then is this going to be in 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.469
 the time t 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:01.330
 and this is going to be in time 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.230
 future you more of the tate after a 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.850
 time interval 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.030
 let's assume that the magnetic field 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.940
 entity is coming out of the plane of the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.659
 graphic therefore it is coming out it 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.390
 represented by points 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.409
 there is a magnetic field coming out there 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.690
 four lines of magnetic field 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.850
 coming out 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.980
 and then a tate time interval 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 the magnetic field is also coming out 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.030
 but it's not coming out in order of four 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 lines but it's coming out in order 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.280
 of two as we see there 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 what 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 that explains the law of links the law of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.110
 links the only thing that does is to oppose 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.180
 that change to see here I have to be 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 coming out four lines here are 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.250
 leaving two lines means that the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.390
 magnetic field is decreasing its 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 magnetic field lines are 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 decreasing 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.509
 lentz is opposed to that in this case 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.049
 decline then as opposed to that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.280
 decrease here should by leds 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 two lines of fields appear so that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.540
 it's the same as what we had here once 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.570
 that you determine that direction of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.179
 field you already know by applying the rule the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.400
 right hand in which direction to go and to the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.670
 induced current then here 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.310
 would be the field coming out of the plan the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.360
 induced current should be in this 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.920
 address 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 so the current should be in the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.300
 breasts and so we're going to explain several 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.910
 more examples then let's put here 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.910
 let's apply the lens law first 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.310
 what is the situation of the spiral in a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.310
 time t and what is the situation of the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.380
 expires as soon as a 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.780
 then tate time interval 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.810
 let's suppose now that the field 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.470
 is coming out of the plane should they 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.470
 be points 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.410
 the plan is coming out 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.090
 let's put three lines coming out the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.410
 plan is well heading towards towards 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.800
 we 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.460
 and after a time interval 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:11.640
 there are no longer three lines but there are now 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.230
 1 2 3 4 and 5 lines there are 5 field lines 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.540
 means that the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.290
 field lines but lynch that 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.080
 established established that he should 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.380
 oppose the change of lines then 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.260
 here I am seeing from 3 to 5 I should try 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.970
 to return to what I had here for 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.580
 try to return what I had here I must 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.560
 eliminate two lines two lines of fields 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 and I want to eliminate they are coming out I should 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.790
 send two lines but now entering 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.799
 so I'm going to eliminate this one here 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 and it 's here 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.340
 adding these two field lines 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.260
 entering would mean that I'm 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.569
 trying to behave like this in 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.939
 the previous case is treated 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.250
 express yourself in that way and according to 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:59.079
 this the field or the induced current of 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 it would be given in a clockwise direction 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.920
 applying the rule of the right hand 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.930
 those are the explanations in mind the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.990
 current is a function of that of the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.850
 red lines let's go now 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.550
 talk about a magnetic field that is 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.400
 entering the explanation is basically 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.800
 the same this is the sphere the inspires 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.140
 that is in a time t and this 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.670
 spiral is in time the 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.620
 same spiral after an interval of 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.180
 tate time 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.710
 let's now talk about magnetic fields 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:35.100
 entering let's say that at this moment 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.100
 we have a field line that is 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.810
 entering two field lines and three 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.009
 field lines that are entering the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.930
 flat so let's look at crosses 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.580
 and then a time interval there is no 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.639
 three but there are only two one and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.149
 two that says the law of the law entity of 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.349
 index I should avoid what happens 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.749
 is happening in this case is 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.149
 occurring a decrease of lines 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:04.540
 to avoid that decrease in lines 

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:06.490
 here we should put a cross 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.140
 with a magnetic field entering to 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.450
 try to match what we had 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.970
 here is already trying to match what 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.430
 we had here if we apply the rule of the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.280
 right hand the magnetic field that is 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.650
 here would generate a current 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.080
 in that direction an induced current 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.509
 and let's now explain the last the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.180
 last condition the last last 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.670
 variable of this physical phenomenon and 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.169
 we have the tea time we have 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.779
 aspires at a time themes of the tate 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:44.330
 then let's see again with lines of 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:47.710
 field entering here I have 1 2 and 3 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.710
 field lines entering 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.810
 is in time you then d 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.630
 a tate time interval 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.480
 the field lines increase a field 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.880
 magnetic zero then I do not have three 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:08.850
 but I have two three four and five 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.520
 that says leds the index must be treated 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.630
 to go back to what I was initially 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.370
 to try to go back to what was 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.330
 initially here I have three here I have 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.290
 five I must eliminate two as he eliminated two 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.580
 sending fields in the opposite direction 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.700
 what we are here and here are 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.590
 entering to make the delete 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.150
 these two the field of view in the direction 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.770
 contrary to them then here should 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.070
 put a point 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.170
 and here I should put a point 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.520
 so how do I have points means that 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.710
 the magnetic field that is coming out 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.240
 generated by them is coming out 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.000
 then the current should be in 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.240
 sense 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.910
 in this case in anti - clockwise direction of 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.170
 according to the rule of the right hand 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.170
 that's all for today thanks
