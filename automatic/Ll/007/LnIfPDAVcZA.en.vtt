00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
game before the idea is to sling

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
game before the idea is to sling
yourself<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.490> planet<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> next

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
yourself from one planet to the next

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
yourself from one planet to the next
collecting<00:01:15.750> gems<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.439> being<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.189> greedy

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
collecting gems and being really greedy

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
so in this case I'm just holding down to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.850 
so in this case I'm just holding down to
connect<00:01:20.460> myself<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.090> planet<00:01:21.860> using

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
connect myself to this planet using

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
magnet powers and I'm throwing myself to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
magnet powers and I'm throwing myself to
the<00:01:25.110> next<00:01:25.409> planet<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.189> case<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> can't<00:01:26.729> tell

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the next planet in case you can't tell

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.399 
the next planet in case you can't tell
I'm<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.180> super<00:01:27.450> engaged<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm not super engaged by this game it
feels<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.860> dull<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.540> they're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
feels a little dull to me they're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.670 
feels a little dull to me they're
definitely<00:01:30.810> been<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> bunch<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> games<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
definitely been a bunch of games that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
definitely been a bunch of games that
have<00:01:31.829> used<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.220> magnet<00:01:33.210> gravity<00:01:34.110> mechanic

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
have used this magnet gravity mechanic

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
have used this magnet gravity mechanic
to<00:01:35.100> move<00:01:35.280> yourself<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.880> world<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.270> world<00:01:36.299> in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to move yourself from world to world in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
to move yourself from world to world in
this<00:01:37.110> case<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.650> whatever<00:01:37.890> reason<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.340> feels<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this case for whatever reason it feels a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
this case for whatever reason it feels a
lot<00:01:39.150> slower<00:01:39.390> than<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.869> should<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.070> sort

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
lot slower than it should and just sort

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
lot slower than it should and just sort
of<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.850> bland<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:44.009> find

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
of like bland and like I I don't find

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469
