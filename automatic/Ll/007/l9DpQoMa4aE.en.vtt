00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:21.390

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.130
 days because we drew short 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.600
 about half an hour a day but of course 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.450
 sometimes it took more when you get carried away 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.620
 the process of setting yourself is not worth it 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.850
