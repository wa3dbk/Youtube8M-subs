 Hello Dan, this is a review of games on 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.220
 explay surfer 801 tablet today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 Will be on review two games strata and agent 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.070
 pi and 1 game which we cover it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070
 will strata 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.840
 this is a very interesting puzzle which 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.510
 draws know its minimalism here 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.179
 most levels from simple to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.899
 challenging let's get started this you're not on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:43.820
 perfectly choose the level 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:43.820
 The first wave in general is the goal of the game for rubles 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 In general, the goal of the game we will need such 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.950
 squares here there are first two for two 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 then three by three will be and more and more 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:02.340
 more and we will need to cover everything 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:07.190
 her color with what ribbons she is very 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 Interesting let's first look at 2 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.140
 start inside under the third wave 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 even 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.420
 In general, look, so here we have three 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.090
 square 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.100
 2 blue and one of these 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.050
 purple we need to cover first 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.340
 purple square mob and then 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.840
 top to top top 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.180
 ribbon that goes in front of the bottom 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.040
 it should be the same color as 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.470
 quadral now choose families look and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.760
 all levels spend very addictive you 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:59.140
 generally interesting to see 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:05.930
 so it turns out generally two types of tracks 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:10.810
 so it turns out 2 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:20.120
 I am collecting something went wrong 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:23.840
 so then we do then so then here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.130
 purple ribbon they're not here again 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 not being released 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:37.270
 then here we do here and not here violet 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.270
 this violet is not then if done 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.020
 generally enough such a difficult game 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.300
 there is something to think about not okay next 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.380
 the game will be this from the runner genre 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.380
 new runner agent pi till you sit some 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.140
 Disney games quite an interesting novel 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.410
 oh so far raw as if there is little 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.930
 the characters and the game itself, and that is to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.610
 A lot of bugs and thinks about defects 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.830
 developers and already get through 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 week you are a good update order and 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.290
 so much else just come by the river 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.770
 there is a need to generally run as you can 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 farther 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.230
 the usual target of the radar and we need 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:25.680
 destroy the doctor here did not remember one 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.510
 learns so here you look standard 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.380
 runner 3-way 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.830
 here we collect the coins we pass 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.670
 different obstacles hell are we now 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.900
 lost say bogdanovich toy 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:47.790
 sometimes it doesn't work at all 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:50.420
 generally interesting enough so let's 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.420
 play again 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.739
 ok i slept for sewage retainer 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.819
 once again in general there are different missions and 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.599
 that's the doctor we need shorter 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.700
 will destroy 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.250
 I have until I can destruction nauseous 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.540
 the gadget is purchased twice in the store 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:21.340
 they all cost over 10,000 of these coins 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.800
 quite expensive just escaped yet 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.880
 What does annoy when I turn 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.970
 what is he before running to the other is it not 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.290
 such a track but generally enough 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:42.360
 interesting to play, you can continue 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.360
 tired so 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.920
 then I will shoot it somewhere five 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.720
 releases or four a week but they 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.210
 will not be very big there will be somewhere 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.530
 two games maximum 3 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.940
 write in the comments as saying 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.360
 in the last issue shoot or review 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.040
 of programs 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.380
 here is the actual shop here is different 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.570
 bonus improvements here are actually those 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.260
 the gadgets that spoke all three here 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.880
 while I think it will add more store 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.890
 the steps in which these are bought there 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.290
 hats which helps to skip there and 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:20.510
 much more and coins here until one 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:25.310
