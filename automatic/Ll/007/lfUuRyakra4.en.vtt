showed<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.380> rushed<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.710> power<00:01:08.010> 6<00:01:08.400> he

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
showed up I rushed into power 6 he

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
showed up I rushed into power 6 he
wasn't<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> resin<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
wasn't in the resin I don't think I it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
wasn't in the resin I don't think I it
has<00:01:11.490> been<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> while<00:01:11.939> since<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.360> read<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> other

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
has been a while since I read the other

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
has been a while since I read the other
three<00:01:13.290> books<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.010> guess<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:15.060> wasn't<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
three books and I guess it wasn't that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
three books and I guess it wasn't that
hard<00:01:15.869> reading<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.619> qualifier<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.250> took<00:01:17.400> me

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
hard reading the qualifier which took me

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
hard reading the qualifier which took me
about<00:01:17.670> our<00:01:17.939> drinks<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.780> weird<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.710> kind

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
about our drinks but weird it was kind

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.740 
about our drinks but weird it was kind
of<00:01:19.950> hard<00:01:20.130> reading<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> forgive<00:01:21.390> me<00:01:21.509> much

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of hard reading it and forgive me much

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
of hard reading it and forgive me much
come<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.409> things<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
come on things but a lot of it I do

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
come on things but a lot of it I do
remember<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> guess<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.200> could<00:01:25.259> reread<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
remember so I guess I could reread the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
remember so I guess I could reread the
books<00:01:26.220> before<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.850> might<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.119> slightly

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
books before and it might be slightly

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420 
books before and it might be slightly
better<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> does<00:01:28.890> start<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
better but it does start off in

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
better but it does start off in
sentiment<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.240> quite<00:01:30.540> nice

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
sentiment of you which is quite nice

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
sentiment of you which is quite nice
because<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> feel<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.369> Sam<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because you know I feel like Sam you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
because you know I feel like Sam you
missed<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.420> alone<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.950> know

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
missed them alone and about I don't know

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.179 
missed them alone and about I don't know
about<00:01:35.520> halfway<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.689> per<00:01:36.869> week<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.470> third<00:01:37.890> into

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
about halfway no per week a third into

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
about halfway no per week a third into
the<00:01:38.280> book<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.640> eat<00:01:38.790> five<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.990> guess<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the book you eat five and I guess it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.510 
the book you eat five and I guess it
could<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> spoiler<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
could be a spoiler but it's kind of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
could be a spoiler but it's kind of
obvious<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> book<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> called<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
obvious because the book is called the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.160 
obvious because the book is called the
qualifier<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.149> bound<00:01:45.450> me<00:01:45.659> five

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
qualifier and it was you bound me five

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
qualifier and it was you bound me five
sometime<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.790> mean<00:01:47.939> five<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.390> person

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
sometime and so you mean five in person

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
sometime and so you mean five in person
take<00:01:49.470> five<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.799> kind<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> funny<00:01:50.729> cool<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
take five I was kind of funny cool but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
take five I was kind of funny cool but
I've<00:01:52.409> discovered<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.430> five<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I've discovered I do not like five the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.440 
I've discovered I do not like five the
reason<00:01:54.630> why<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.470> guess<00:01:55.770> five<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.640> okay<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
reason why is I guess five was okay I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.249 
reason why is I guess five was okay I
just<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.619> five<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:00.259> there's

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
just don't really like five and there's

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.940 
just don't really like five and there's
a<00:02:01.350> reason<00:02:01.740> why<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.750> basically<00:02:03.750> skim<00:02:04.200> read<00:02:04.500> most

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a reason why I basically skim read most

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.270 
a reason why I basically skim read most
the<00:02:05.250> book<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.930> didn't<00:02:07.439> seem<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the book because it didn't seem as if it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.930 
the book because it didn't seem as if it
was<00:02:08.369> written<00:02:08.660> by<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:10.039> authors<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
was written by the same authors so it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.100 
was written by the same authors so it
felt<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.270> there<00:02:12.510> was<00:02:12.660> another

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
felt like there was another

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.770 
felt like there was another
person<00:02:13.470> writing<00:02:13.710> or<00:02:14.400> alternatively<00:02:15.360> because

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
person writing or alternatively because

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
person writing or alternatively because
I<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> authors<00:02:17.040> has<00:02:17.340> had<00:02:17.580> some

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I know one of the authors has had some

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.890 
I know one of the authors has had some
problems<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> past

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
problems in the past

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
problems in the past
I'm<00:02:19.020> not<00:02:19.320> exactly<00:02:19.560> sure<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.040> true<00:02:20.340> but

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
I'm not exactly sure if that is true but

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.940 
I'm not exactly sure if that is true but
it<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:20.910> read<00:02:21.120> online<00:02:21.270> maybe<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.830> of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it was what I read online maybe one of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.860 
it was what I read online maybe one of
the<00:02:23.040> authors<00:02:23.490> was<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.450> through<00:02:24.660> something

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the authors was going through something

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.350 
the authors was going through something
and<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.620> other<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.950> wrote<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> lot<00:02:26.610> more<00:02:26.820> than

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and the other one wrote a lot more than

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.550 
and the other one wrote a lot more than
normal<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.800> was<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.430> hard<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.970> tell

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
normal and it was kind of hard to tell

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560 
normal and it was kind of hard to tell
whose<00:02:31.560> perspective<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.520> wasn't<00:02:32.730> through<00:02:33.330> most

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
whose perspective it wasn't through most

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.050 
whose perspective it wasn't through most
of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> book<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.830> I'm<00:02:35.040> guessing<00:02:35.370> maybe<00:02:35.850> on

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
of the book but I'm guessing maybe on

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.510 
of the book but I'm guessing maybe on
Kindle<00:02:36.540> books<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.560> font<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.370> each

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
Kindle books that the font for each

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.520 
Kindle books that the font for each
chapter<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.090> each<00:02:39.330> person<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:40.020> different

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
chapter of each person is not different

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.730 
chapter of each person is not different
where<00:02:41.040> than<00:02:41.280> their<00:02:41.430> actual<00:02:41.640> physical<00:02:42.180> copies

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
where than their actual physical copies

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.620 
where than their actual physical copies
the<00:02:43.740> font<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.130> different<00:02:44.520> for<00:02:44.760> personal<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the font is different for personal it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.660 
the font is different for personal it
just<00:02:45.870> seemed<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.410> different<00:02:47.160> from<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
just seemed a very different from the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.340 
just seemed a very different from the
other<00:02:47.850> books<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> was<00:02:48.959> kind<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
other books and I was kind of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.050 
other books and I was kind of
disappointed<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.220> had<00:02:50.490> been<00:02:50.730> warned

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
disappointed and I had been warned

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
disappointed and I had been warned
before<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:51.870> very<00:02:52.050> different

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
before that it was very different

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920 
before that it was very different
so<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.280> until<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.730> knew<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.480> was<00:02:54.690> gonna

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so going until I knew that it was gonna

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
so going until I knew that it was gonna
be<00:02:55.140> slightly<00:02:55.410> different<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:56.250> written

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
be slightly different like written

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.910 
be slightly different like written
differently<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.900> did<00:02:58.050> seem<00:02:58.260> very<00:02:58.470> thick<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
differently but it did seem very thick a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.729 
differently but it did seem very thick a
small<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.820> guess<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.230> really

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
small like I guess it just is really

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.120 
small like I guess it just is really
boring<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.640> stupid<00:03:02.910> up<00:03:03.300> until<00:03:03.660> about<00:03:03.920> 75%<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
boring and stupid up until about 75% and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.090 
boring and stupid up until about 75% and
and<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> little<00:03:06.330> spoiler<00:03:06.810> all<00:03:07.350> those<00:03:07.560> last<00:03:07.830> four

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and a little spoiler all those last four

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.520 
and a little spoiler all those last four
looks<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:09.270> gets<00:03:09.540> good<00:03:09.870> when<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:10.380> go<00:03:10.500> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
looks but it gets good when they go to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.490 
looks but it gets good when they go to
Florida<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.610> once<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.630> hear<00:03:12.930> about<00:03:13.200> them<00:03:13.350> go

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
Florida so once you hear about them go

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.410 
Florida so once you hear about them go
to<00:03:13.560> Florida<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.130> gets<00:03:14.670> better<00:03:14.910> from<00:03:15.030> there<00:03:15.120> on

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
to Florida it gets better from there on

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.600 
to Florida it gets better from there on
and<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.780> then<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.890> goes<00:03:17.130> down<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.580> a

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
and and then all the goes down as a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.330 
and and then all the goes down as a
major<00:03:17.910> plot<00:03:18.209> twist<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.810> oh<00:03:18.900> my<00:03:19.170> god<00:03:19.440> my<00:03:19.709> fields

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.940 

and<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:29.820> made<00:03:30.060> me<00:03:30.240> really<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.750> sad<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
and it made me really really sad and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.560 
and it made me really really sad and
when<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.460> up<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> fetch<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.450> I'm
