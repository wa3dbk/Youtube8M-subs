the<00:00:45.050> subject<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:45.769> moving<00:00:46.780> every<00:00:47.780> time<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.350> try

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
the subject is moving every time you try

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.790 
the subject is moving every time you try
to<00:00:48.920> focus<00:00:49.219> you'll<00:00:49.699> have<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.120> compose<00:00:50.800> magnify

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
to focus you'll have to compose magnify

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.509 
to focus you'll have to compose magnify
and<00:00:52.780> just<00:00:53.780> hope<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.260> don't<00:00:54.410> adjust<00:00:55.339> the

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
and just hope that you don't adjust the

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.189 
and just hope that you don't adjust the
camera<00:00:56.000> because<00:00:56.359> otherwise<00:00:56.750> you'll<00:00:57.019> have<00:00:57.050> to

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
camera because otherwise you'll have to

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.919 
camera because otherwise you'll have to
zoom<00:00:57.500> out<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.859> recompose<00:00:58.339> once<00:00:58.609> again<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
zoom out and recompose once again the

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.599 
zoom out and recompose once again the
problem<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.499> even<00:01:00.530> harder<00:01:01.219> when<00:01:01.429> you're

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
problem is even harder when you're

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.180 
problem is even harder when you're
trying<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.059> focus<00:01:02.629> on<00:01:02.989> something<00:01:03.050> four<00:01:03.859> and
