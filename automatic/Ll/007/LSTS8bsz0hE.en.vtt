00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
recorded quite some time ago this is the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.980 
recorded quite some time ago this is the

last of the pre-recorded games I have so
the<00:01:09.140> next<00:01:09.380> video<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.250> will<00:01:10.280> see<00:01:10.460> will<00:01:10.850> be

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
the next video you will see will be

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.300 
the next video you will see will be
quite<00:01:11.240> recent<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.200> don't<00:01:12.650> think<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.070> should

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
quite recent but I don't think it should

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.540 
quite recent but I don't think it should
matter<00:01:13.520> too<00:01:13.820> much<00:01:14.320> anyways<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.040> are<00:01:16.070> on<00:01:16.370> an

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
matter too much anyways we are on an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.420 
matter too much anyways we are on an
extremely<00:01:17.090> easy<00:01:17.450> map<00:01:17.870> and<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:18.650> decided<00:01:19.220> to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
extremely easy map and so I decided to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.610 
extremely easy map and so I decided to
just<00:01:19.760> fool<00:01:20.120> around<00:01:20.150> with<00:01:20.900> this<00:01:21.020> sense<00:01:21.380> you

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
just fool around with this sense you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.860 
just fool around with this sense you
guys<00:01:21.890> will<00:01:22.280> probably<00:01:22.310> get<00:01:23.030> bored<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.600> seeing

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
guys will probably get bored of seeing

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.370 
guys will probably get bored of seeing
the<00:01:24.170> ninja<00:01:24.620> bomb<00:01:25.100> arctic<00:01:25.940> wind<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.570> 2/3

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
the ninja bomb arctic wind and 2/3

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.520 
the ninja bomb arctic wind and 2/3
village<00:01:27.740> combo<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.240> did<00:01:29.630> use<00:01:29.840> ninjas<00:01:30.320> for

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
village combo but I did use ninjas for

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.980 
village combo but I did use ninjas for
this<00:01:30.740> since<00:01:31.490> they<00:01:31.730> are<00:01:31.820> simply<00:01:32.330> too<00:01:32.540> good<00:01:32.780> to

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
this since they are simply too good to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.700 
this since they are simply too good to
pass<00:01:33.170> up<00:01:33.410> on<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.860> also<00:01:34.670> got<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.150> 0/0<00:01:36.110> cannon<00:01:36.560> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
pass up on I also got a 0/0 cannon to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
pass up on I also got a 0/0 cannon to
pop<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.190> LEDs<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:38.510> yeah<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:40.040> can<00:01:40.220> see<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.490> am

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
pop the LEDs so yeah as you can see I am

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.810 
pop the LEDs so yeah as you can see I am
also<00:01:41.000> going<00:01:41.450> farms<00:01:42.140> because<00:01:42.950> why<00:01:43.220> they'll<00:01:43.550> not

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
also going farms because why they'll not

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.750 
also going farms because why they'll not
you<00:01:44.720> really<00:01:44.960> don't<00:01:45.380> need<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.860> use<00:01:46.070> forms<00:01:46.520> for

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
you really don't need to use forms for

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.940 
you really don't need to use forms for
any<00:01:46.910> tile<00:01:47.240> at<00:01:47.510> all<00:01:47.660> but<00:01:48.260> I<00:01:48.290> guess<00:01:48.620> it's<00:01:48.860> just

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
any tile at all but I guess it's just

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.460 
any tile at all but I guess it's just
fun<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.490> accumulate<00:01:50.360> hundreds<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.960> thousands

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
fun to accumulate hundreds of thousands

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.310 
fun to accumulate hundreds of thousands
of<00:01:51.560> cash<00:01:51.830> by<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.100> end<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.730> game<00:01:53.320> speaking

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
of cash by the end of the game speaking

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.650 
of cash by the end of the game speaking
of<00:01:54.470> cash<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.980> just<00:01:55.610> got<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> temple<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.510> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
of cash I just got the temple of the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.290 
of cash I just got the temple of the
monkey<00:01:57.080> god<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.620> could<00:01:58.430> probably<00:01:58.700> show<00:01:59.270> you
