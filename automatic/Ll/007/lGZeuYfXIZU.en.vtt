00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.979
 is the one for zero one for zero and there will be 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.580
 to make the balance if it was left 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.589
 short to blue cross or to america today 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.599
 it also fell short what it is that 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:17.250
 the first question is who was better 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.690
 on the pitch, gentlemen, all 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.030
 gentlemen sir tomorrow 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.510
 I do believe that America looked flat 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.060
 the attack lacks variants he listened 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.059
 a few minutes ago arbitration agent 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.100
 criticize today's arbitration of the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.809
 Central language I think they are wrong 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.359
 today the referee has nothing to do with the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.730
 result in america did not know how to open 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.219
 the blue cross defense had arrival and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.230
 he found a very important one that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.230
 jesús corona ended up taking out gómez 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:57.989
 of what we saw we saw and not heard 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.390
 they were telling us but out there I do not know 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.930
 when 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:10.050
 and the market plays of goal or penalties 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.850
 the truth that I to the particular I do not 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.490
 I can criticize or think that the new 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.550
 goalkeeper was because of arbitration not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.800
 for details as normally in all 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.680
 the parties but think that in this 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.090
 scoreboard or this result is at fault 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 of arbitration not for that mixed with 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 how bad the party was 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330
 terrible that was the match 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.979
 I am the one who was there 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.110
 they had paid by applying the pumps 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 pinch us in the elbows let's say to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 hits for a ticket for this is to ask 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.229
 something paying 1,500 babies or 27 thousand like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 they are watching over the internet they should not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.830
 of having repented and many do not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.229
 it seems that people did not leave happy 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.270
 with the show they stayed very much 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.530
 to see and they had surprising for evil 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 these teams because what they came for 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
 towards a line painted for a series 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.190
 of yowl not going to review what was 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 the party the blue cross team went down 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 a good downpour receiving the america 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.500
 the first blue cross minutes have 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.330
 of played has a pair played this 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.970
 middle distance chaco shot 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.940
 where I think the goalkeepers went 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.520
 well crowns that went well 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.690
 goalkeepers but also not very anomalous 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.690
 in goal if one analyzes it 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.560
 so the handling of the cards today 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.600
 as it was and we discussed it in the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.130
 first on the first play where he 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.390
 ok this is the first card 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.880
 yellow that they take out but existing 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.940
 a 90-minute global review by 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.940
 of 100 decisions he has but for me 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.780
 I did not dislike your job possibly 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.850
 in that feeling you can have there that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 remember some guy who has barely 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.290
 take two parts out of pocket 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.290
 America 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.430
 Layún is attached to the Chaco Layún 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.980
 forget about the brand because not even 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.230
 see the ball again and when they continue 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.420
 looking for man and man this one does 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.489
 it's going to sting and you take the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.640
 logically paints the ball you'll 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.500
 relax is a mistake of there is a portal of 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.700
 awareness of the aquivald journey towards 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.709
 in front to try to silence a 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.810
 Thursday arrival never arrives that this 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.810
 auction that ends in the Chaco 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.730
 in the frame of the tone salon of the bride 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.730
 but the same 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.990
 and I remind him of the head chaco 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.720
 any that makes me saints with the 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.220
 three peso defense that had saints 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.770
 leaving everything for the concachampions to 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.510
 that only 10 and how was the goal was equal 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.490
 in a corner shot of the chaco it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.560
 find a ball in the bad ball 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.670
 criminal half time was here we are 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.770
 watching the theophilus cover about who 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.220
 that changes the game there is no 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.800
 to reproach America with the blue cross 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.320
 purple engineers but the second 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.680
 america time tried the second half 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.680
 it's more you 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:29.250
 It's one thing to have the ball 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.250
 [Applause] 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.660
 ball art 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.610
 to really have variants to have idea 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.410
 have a difference in the ball in the 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.539
 start the second time blue cross no 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.680
 he knew how to leave his area because he did not know 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.680
 got all blue far behind 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.130
 they already gave you the land they gave you 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.810
 the ball now your thing is to know what 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.400
 do with it in america 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.560
 rarely new by the marker in the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.560
 tournament because he did not know what to do 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.979
 there is a card they are causing more 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.979
 stay in contact 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.220
 yes I here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:41.380
 there is more 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.380
 orozco the latter is lifting the face 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.290
 we go
