00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.010
 very good hello people how are you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.889
 sorry we are boyfriends for the east channel 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.320
 from a pc tutorial I will go fast to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.119
 grain will see that I did not put out finished 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.029
 because I do not have editing programs 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.970
 videos showing how I was caching is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.500
 because we do not have qantas and the pc noomas 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.050
 install it an error appears here 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.330
 Remove black edges stripes bars 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.369
 as you want to say that they appear to the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.810
 sides in the games that a lot of people 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.380
 think that this error of 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.020
 of how is the role of your graphics card 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.980
 this video only works if you have 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.040
 intel card if you have you or the other 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 so look for an activity video that does not 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 have only serves for intel what to do in 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.650
 windows 8 also serves other windows 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.910
 good very easy right click resolution 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.810
 of screen 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.150
 here we lower it all apply keep 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.089
 changes to the retail will surely in that the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.860
 video shrugged quietly because you guys 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.830
 the bars will appear to the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.260
 sides now let's go to the plan of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.510
 Fuck control they hope that emits another 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.590
 thing 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.040
 and this is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.470
 what is this 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.160
 I dont know 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 with the mathematical input panel I do not know 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.790
 what characters 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 freedom to leave 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 who are going to where it says graphics or 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.960
 they have it in categories what do you change it to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.159
 with great graphics and multimedia people 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.159
 you open it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.149
 spray in second 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.909
 good people forgive for the pause in order 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.580
 we are opened this we leave this in mode 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:58.090
 basic accept we hope there will be 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.330
 here is all this from intel 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.460
 let's go here on the scale says keep 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.890
 format or sometimes it appears to center the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.730
 image let's put scale to screen 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.680
 full we apply accept to accept 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.319
 everyone is going to be big and ugly 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.209
 maybe in the video you do not notice it 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.360
 but everything is getting great now 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.810
 missing we go to screen resolution and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.379
 this we upload it we apply to conserve 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.260
 changes accept and ready let's take advantage of 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.640
 to explain another mistake there is such 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.310
 time when we are in video games 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.739
 we sink keys and things 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.810
