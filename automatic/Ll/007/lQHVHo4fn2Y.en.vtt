00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.969 

let's<00:00:00.960> think<00:00:01.140> about<00:00:01.290> adding<00:00:01.740> whole<00:00:01.920> numbers

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
let's think about adding whole numbers

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.820 
let's think about adding whole numbers
with<00:00:02.520> fractions<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.080> problem<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.650> have

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
with fractions for this problem I have

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.579 
with fractions for this problem I have
five<00:00:05.130> plus<00:00:05.520> two<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.029> half<00:00:06.240> I'm<00:00:06.569> first<00:00:07.379> going

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
five plus two and a half I'm first going

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.620 
five plus two and a half I'm first going
to<00:00:07.740> add<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.160> fractions<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> five<00:00:09.599> I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
to add my fractions with the five I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870 
to add my fractions with the five I
don't<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> fraction<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.040> just<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.550> one

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
don't have a fraction so I just have one

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
don't have a fraction so I just have one
half<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.710> then<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.769> add<00:00:13.950> my<00:00:14.099> whole<00:00:14.340> numbers<00:00:14.670> 5

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
half and then I add my whole numbers 5

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.800 
half and then I add my whole numbers 5
plus<00:00:15.299> 2<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> 7<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:17.190> answer<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.850> 5<00:00:18.150> plus<00:00:18.570> 2

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
plus 2 which is 7 my answer for 5 plus 2

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.450 
plus 2 which is 7 my answer for 5 plus 2
and<00:00:18.900> 1/2<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.350> 7<00:00:19.710> &amp;<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.949> half

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
and 1/2 is 7 &amp; a half

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200 
and 1/2 is 7 &amp; a half
let's<00:00:21.359> look<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.660> 3<00:00:22.109> &amp;<00:00:22.289> 2<00:00:22.470> sevenths<00:00:22.980> plus<00:00:23.130> 2<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
let's look at 3 &amp; 2 sevenths plus 2 and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.679 
let's look at 3 &amp; 2 sevenths plus 2 and
1/7<00:00:25.130> when<00:00:26.130> adding<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.640> fractions<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.390> need<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
1/7 when adding my fractions I need to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
1/7 when adding my fractions I need to
make<00:00:27.840> sure<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.439> denominators<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
make sure that the denominators are the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.170 
make sure that the denominators are the
same<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.029> 7<00:00:30.810> &amp;<00:00:31.050> 7<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.679> same<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.550> my

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
same and 7 &amp; 7 are the same so my

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
same and 7 &amp; 7 are the same so my
denominator<00:00:33.360> stays<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.200> same<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> add<00:00:35.790> my

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
denominator stays the same then I add my

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
denominator stays the same then I add my
numerators<00:00:36.630> 2<00:00:36.930> plus<00:00:37.410> 1<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.770> 3<00:00:38.780> now<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:39.930> going

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
numerators 2 plus 1 is 3 now I'm going

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
numerators 2 plus 1 is 3 now I'm going
to<00:00:40.200> add<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.559> whole<00:00:40.800> numbers<00:00:41.160> 3<00:00:41.550> plus<00:00:41.850> 2<00:00:42.210> which

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to add my whole numbers 3 plus 2 which

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
to add my whole numbers 3 plus 2 which
is<00:00:42.540> 5<00:00:43.280> 5<00:00:44.280> &amp;<00:00:44.550> 3/7<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.480> answer<00:00:47.000> when<00:00:48.000> I'm

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is 5 5 &amp; 3/7 is your answer when I'm

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
is 5 5 &amp; 3/7 is your answer when I'm
adding<00:00:48.360> fractions<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.410> unlike

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
adding fractions that have unlike

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.270 
adding fractions that have unlike
denominators<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.969> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> change<00:00:51.660> them

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
denominators I need to change them

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.740 
denominators I need to change them
remember<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.399> order<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.820> add<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.300> subtract

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
remember in order to add or subtract

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
remember in order to add or subtract
fractions<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.680> must<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.219> like

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
fractions there must have like

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.689 
fractions there must have like
denominators<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> 4<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
denominators so I have a 4 and I have a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.299 
denominators so I have a 4 and I have a
2<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> need<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> find<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.530> denominators

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
2 so I need to find like denominators

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.189 
2 so I need to find like denominators
I'm<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.690> finding<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I'm going to do that by finding the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280 
I'm going to do that by finding the
least<00:01:04.439> common<00:01:05.360> denominator<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
least common denominator I'm going to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.760 
least common denominator I'm going to
list<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> multiples<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.400> each<00:01:08.549> number<00:01:09.060> 2<00:01:10.220> 4<00:01:11.540> 6

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
list the multiples of each number 2 4 6

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
list the multiples of each number 2 4 6
and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> 4<00:01:14.490> &amp;<00:01:15.030> 8

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and then I have 4 &amp; 8

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then I have 4 &amp; 8
I<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> stop<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> could

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I know that I can stop there I could

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.480 
I know that I can stop there I could
have<00:01:17.790> listed<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.560> stopping<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have listed more but stopping there I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.350 
have listed more but stopping there I
can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.600> 4<00:01:21.960> &amp;<00:01:22.259> 4<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.740> common<00:01:23.360> for

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can see that I have 4 &amp; 4 in common for

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
can see that I have 4 &amp; 4 in common for
3<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.750> 1/4<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> same

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
3 and 1/4 it's going to say the same

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.240 
3 and 1/4 it's going to say the same
however<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.450> 1/2<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> change<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
however for 1/2 I need to change the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.749 
however for 1/2 I need to change the
denominator<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> 4<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.720> did<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.860> by<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.040> 2

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
denominator to a 4 I did that by doing 2

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
denominator to a 4 I did that by doing 2
times<00:01:33.299> 2<00:01:33.689> equals<00:01:33.720> 4<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.340> 1<00:01:35.820> times<00:01:36.329> 2<00:01:36.840> which

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
times 2 equals 4 so I do 1 times 2 which

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
times 2 equals 4 so I do 1 times 2 which
equals<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:38.720> your<00:01:39.720> new<00:01:40.020> fraction<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:41.040> two

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
equals to your new fraction is two

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.020 
equals to your new fraction is two
fourths<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.409> problem<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.979> 2<00:01:44.310> &amp;<00:01:44.579> 2<00:01:44.759> 4

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
fourths so now your problem is 2 &amp; 2 4

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
fourths so now your problem is 2 &amp; 2 4
plus<00:01:45.570> 3<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> 1/4<00:01:46.890> equals<00:01:48.049> again<00:01:49.049> you're<00:01:49.259> going

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
plus 3 and 1/4 equals again you're going

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
plus 3 and 1/4 equals again you're going
to<00:01:49.560> look<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:51.380> putting<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.560> denominator<00:01:53.189> down

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
to look at putting your denominator down

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.569 
to look at putting your denominator down
for<00:01:53.970> your<00:01:54.090> fraction<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> 4<00:01:55.290> 2<00:01:55.979> plus<00:01:56.310> 1<00:01:56.549> is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
for your fraction which is 4 2 plus 1 is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.289 
for your fraction which is 4 2 plus 1 is
3

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
3

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.740 
3
and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.799> 2<00:01:59.130> plus<00:01:59.640> 3<00:02:00.090> which<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.390> going

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and then I have 2 plus 3 which is going

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.219 
and then I have 2 plus 3 which is going
to<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.960> 5<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.680> answer<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.100> 5<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.579> 3/4<00:02:03.229> for

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to be 5 your answer is 5 and 3/4 for

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.800 
to be 5 your answer is 5 and 3/4 for
this<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.710> 2<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> 1/5<00:02:05.820> plus<00:02:06.119> 9<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> 2

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this one I have 2 and 1/5 plus 9 and 2

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
this one I have 2 and 1/5 plus 9 and 2
15<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> denominators<00:02:09.629> are

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
15 I can see that the denominators are

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.770 
15 I can see that the denominators are
not<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> same<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> find<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> LCD<00:02:12.390> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
not the same I need to find the LCD in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.160 
not the same I need to find the LCD in
order<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
order to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.930 
order to
make<00:02:13.380> them<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> same<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.340> least<00:02:14.580> common

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
make them the same the least common

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.790 
make them the same the least common
denominator<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.840> start<00:02:16.170> by<00:02:16.290> listing<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
denominator I start by listing the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
denominator I start by listing the
multiples<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.370> 5<00:02:17.670> 5<00:02:18.660> 10<00:02:19.819> 15<00:02:20.819> I'm<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> stop

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
multiples of 5 5 10 15 I'm going to stop

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.240 
multiples of 5 5 10 15 I'm going to stop
there<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> list<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
there because I know when I list the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.870 
there because I know when I list the
multiples<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.730> 15<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.300> start<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.780> 15<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.880> 15

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
multiples of 15 I start with 15 and 15

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.160 
multiples of 15 I start with 15 and 15
is<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.450> common

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
is what they have in common

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020 
is what they have in common
so<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.739> denominator<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.489> now<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> change

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
so my denominator is now going to change

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.350 
so my denominator is now going to change
the<00:02:30.480> 15<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.860> only<00:02:32.069> need<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.459> change<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.120> top

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the 15 you only need to change the top

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840 
the 15 you only need to change the top
one<00:02:33.660> though<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.130> bottom<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.459> already

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
one though because the bottom is already

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.090 
one though because the bottom is already
15<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.230> 5<00:02:37.590> times<00:02:38.130> 3<00:02:38.910> equals<00:02:39.180> 15<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.470> need<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> do

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
15 so 5 times 3 equals 15 I need to do

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.580 
15 so 5 times 3 equals 15 I need to do
that<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> top<00:02:41.790> 1<00:02:42.300> times<00:02:42.720> 3<00:02:43.200> which<00:02:43.410> would

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that to the top 1 times 3 which would

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.090 
that to the top 1 times 3 which would
equal<00:02:43.920> 3<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.720> new<00:02:46.019> fraction<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.950> going

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
equal 3 so now my new fraction is going

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.770 
equal 3 so now my new fraction is going
to<00:02:47.280> be<00:02:47.430> 2<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.000> 3<00:02:48.420> 15<00:02:48.989> +<00:02:49.470> 9<00:02:49.860> +<00:02:50.130> 2<00:02:50.280> 15<00:02:50.819> my

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
to be 2 and 3 15 + 9 + 2 15 my

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.809 
to be 2 and 3 15 + 9 + 2 15 my
denominator<00:02:52.410> stays<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.860> same<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.220> my<00:02:53.340> answer

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
denominator stays the same in my answer

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.150 
denominator stays the same in my answer
3<00:02:54.810> +<00:02:55.110> 2<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:55.980> 5<00:02:56.400> +<00:02:56.819> 2<00:02:57.690> +<00:02:57.930> 9<00:02:58.049> my<00:02:58.920> whole

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
3 + 2 is going to be 5 + 2 + 9 my whole

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460 
3 + 2 is going to be 5 + 2 + 9 my whole
numbers<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.880> do<00:02:59.940> last<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.840> going<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.260> be

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
numbers I do last which is going to be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.670 
numbers I do last which is going to be
11<00:03:02.030> now<00:03:03.030> looking<00:03:03.330> at<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.989> fraction

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
11 now looking at this this fraction

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.390 
11 now looking at this this fraction
part<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.459> reduced<00:03:06.860> my<00:03:07.860> whole<00:03:08.100> number

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
part can be reduced my whole number

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.330 
part can be reduced my whole number
stays<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.970> same<00:03:09.000> though<00:03:09.600> now<00:03:10.590> reducing<00:03:11.220> I

need to figure out what goes into 5 and

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.610 
need to figure out what goes into 5 and
into<00:03:13.530> 15<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:15.180> figure<00:03:15.390> out<00:03:15.569> by<00:03:16.049> finding<00:03:16.470> the

GCF or the greatest common factor I'm

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.099 
GCF or the greatest common factor I'm
going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.489> list<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.850> factors<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.299> 5<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:21.959> is

times 5 my GCF in this case is 5 so I'm

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.479 
times 5 my GCF in this case is 5 so I'm
going<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.980> divide<00:03:35.340> each<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.570> by<00:03:37.350> 5<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:38.310> order

going to divide each one by 5 in order

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to divide each one by 5 in order

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
to find my new fraction 5 divided by 5

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.610 
to find my new fraction 5 divided by 5
is<00:03:41.670> 1<00:03:41.930> 15<00:03:42.930> divided<00:03:43.350> by<00:03:43.380> 5<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.709> 3<00:03:44.250> my<00:03:45.150> new<00:03:45.620> answer
