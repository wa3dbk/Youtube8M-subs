00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.420
 hello everyone guys 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.430
 it was you we will go 1 to 20 years lizzare our accessories how to open here in front 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.109
 and in the life of dogs and cats congrats on 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.159
 definitely 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 the accessory that supports 2sb 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.739
 we will go have it 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.919
 let's say 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.989
 to see if 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.230
 with hard disk 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.990
 yes self-sustained that I have never invented riddle in the weight of 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.990
 current to be able to turn 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.830
 let's start with 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.010
 simply insert the accessories must 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.290
 to her text 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 don't share adamo inserted 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.300
 and we insert 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.900
 biska 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.570
 we take to insert this a hard disk not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.670
 powered 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.920
 so take all the current for 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 directly from the iped and see what happens 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.660
 and here it appears 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.340
 fb error message I read 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.719
 that accessory 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.259
 not available because the power consumption is the accessory connected 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.340
 excessive 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.090
 so let's see immediately 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.640
 and theme we say that some people asked themselves 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 that up 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.880
 you tend is possible 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.010
 use a hard disk 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.120
 self powered 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 to see also on the files for bed and scruple 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
 Let's check 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.910
 precisely on mnt 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 and it does not appear 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 none and hardisk 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.900
 I must have su instead 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.850
 hard disk 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.350
 I commented and therefore I need 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 d1 power outlet 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.499
 functional grandchild and see what happens 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.090
 here is our dog all sb duel disk 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.739
 powered 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.369
 and see what happens 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.369
 hardisk is running for those who lie 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.819
 eg it took was 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.249
 the power of the potential and from the socket 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.089
 and not how the fed one happens 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.089
 from the scandal sb 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.009
 for now klaipeda or no risk there is no error message instead 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.479
 appears with appennino sb 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.969
 expect another little bit then we become directly on hi-fi 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.589
 i can't the files 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.989
 ccleaner 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 we wait a little longer 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:21.079
 I believe that working 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.079
 is not at least correct for now 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.339
 does not work 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.639
 so we also played these lema instead some I said 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.870
 scout a lie kessler in a self-powered and it works simple 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.599
 this mind would seem not to work 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.709
 above, our Fridays are written by others rather 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.729
 old 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.919
 why now 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.229
 peano 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:51.789
 endwar self-powered disk so I greet you + however it works on 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.479
 computer effect instead of mayors and why it doesn't work 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.029
 I love you that at least in the next version via the files 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.609
 and there is this possibility I have seen that it is not rendered as we have said 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.239
 there 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.409
 the paste, add salt to the electrical outlet 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.169
 should turn 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.169
 through dyslexia told by itself 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.049
 the electric power 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.389
 in the plug in another action you are connected to the local network with 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.669
 that other 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.340
