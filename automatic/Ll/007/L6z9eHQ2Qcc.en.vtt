inside<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> frame<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> will<00:01:06.060> make<00:01:06.689> sure<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the frame so all I'm doing is bending

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
the frame so all I'm doing is bending
the<00:01:11.220> paper<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:11.729> top<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.810> edge<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cardboard that way I can get the basic

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
cardboard that way I can get the basic
shape<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.250> size<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> need<00:01:18.630> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.259 

so<00:02:34.319> this<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.890> basic<00:02:35.040> gist<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.879> what<00:02:36.239> i

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
so this is the basic gist of what i

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.940 
so this is the basic gist of what i
wanted<00:02:36.660> my<00:02:36.930> background<00:02:37.410> feels<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.800> i<00:02:37.920> just

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
wanted my background feels like i just

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.369 
wanted my background feels like i just
want<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.400> sort<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.700> cool<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.239> smudgy<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
want it to be sort of cool and smudgy so

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.080 
want it to be sort of cool and smudgy so
I<00:02:40.410> laid<00:02:40.709> down<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> piece<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> cardboard<00:02:41.550> simply

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
I laid down a piece of cardboard simply

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.600 
I laid down a piece of cardboard simply
because<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> past<00:02:42.720> cell<00:02:43.080> sort<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.980> gets<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
because the past cell sort of gets a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.220 
because the past cell sort of gets a
little<00:02:44.760> messy<00:02:44.879> when<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.480> laying<00:02:45.660> down<00:02:45.930> flat

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
little messy when it's laying down flat

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.650 
little messy when it's laying down flat
on<00:02:46.260> something<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.700> I'm<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
on something and then I'm just going to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
on something and then I'm just going to
take<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.170> cardboard<00:02:49.470> piece<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.280> we

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
take the cardboard piece that we

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.220 
take the cardboard piece that we
originally<00:02:50.910> used<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.209> measure<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
originally used to measure I'm going to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.809 
originally used to measure I'm going to
fold<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> paper<00:02:52.800> back<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:53.310> top<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
fold the paper back over top of it and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.270 
fold the paper back over top of it and
tape<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> down<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.230> way<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.500> paper<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
tape it down that way the paper is the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.460 
tape it down that way the paper is the
exact<00:02:56.610> size<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.659> slip<00:02:57.930> this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
exact size and you can just slip this

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.170 
exact size and you can just slip this
little<00:02:58.769> piece<00:02:58.980> into<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.550> frame<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.970> you're

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
little piece into the frame and you're

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.100 
little piece into the frame and you're
going<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.599> good<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> go

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
going to be good to go

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.700 
going to be good to go
and<00:03:03.270> for<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> top<00:03:04.600> edges<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.110> sort<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.380> folded

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
and for the top edges I sort of folded

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.260 
and for the top edges I sort of folded
in<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.980> corners<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.850> wrapping<00:03:07.210> a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
in the corners like I was wrapping a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.910 
in the corners like I was wrapping a
present<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:07.990> folded<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.470> down<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
present and then folded it down and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.960 
present and then folded it down and
that's<00:03:09.070> how<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:09.400> get<00:03:09.490> sort<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that's how you can get sort of the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.000 
that's how you can get sort of the
tightest<00:03:10.420> fit<00:03:11.080> over<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.440> cardboard<00:03:11.950> you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
tightest fit over the cardboard you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.810 
tightest fit over the cardboard you
really<00:03:12.250> want<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.490> be<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.850> tight<00:03:13.780> Lee<00:03:14.520> down<00:03:15.520> to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
really want to be as tight Lee down to

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.110 
really want to be as tight Lee down to
the<00:03:15.940> cardboard<00:03:16.420> as<00:03:16.660> possible<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.620> then

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the cardboard as possible and then

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.190 
the cardboard as possible and then
you're<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:19.150> going<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.630> start<00:03:19.870> reassembling
