00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
something on the exhaust asked twist and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880 
something on the exhaust asked twist and
we're

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.740 

yeah

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you know I just wanted to banish like

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
you know I just wanted to banish like
it's<00:03:20.840> positive

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.490 

I<00:03:27.410> ain't<00:03:28.410> coming<00:03:28.680> off

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500 

going<00:03:34.010> down<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.490> ground

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
going down the ground

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.910 
going down the ground
followed<00:03:37.049> out<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.530> life

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:50.500 

put<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:40.640> jacked<00:03:40.880> up<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.270> back<00:03:49.330> now<00:03:50.330> where's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
put it jacked up in the back now where's

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.250 
put it jacked up in the back now where's
the<00:03:50.660> part<00:03:50.870> that's<00:03:51.140> broken

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.580 

I<00:03:54.580> can't<00:03:55.580> right<00:03:56.390> here<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:56.750> office<00:03:57.020> JB<00:03:57.290> will

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
I can't right here we're office JB will

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.060 
I can't right here we're office JB will
so<00:04:01.780> that's<00:04:02.780> all<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.230> reason<00:04:03.530> we're<00:04:03.650> taking<00:04:03.950> in

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
so that's all the reason we're taking in

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.380 
so that's all the reason we're taking in
parts<00:04:04.370> because<00:04:04.610> there's<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.910> crack<00:04:05.180> right

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
parts because there's a crack right

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.300 
parts because there's a crack right
there

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.509 

that's<00:04:13.850> a<00:04:14.030> new<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.300> go<00:04:14.540> in

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
that's a new one go in

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.240 
that's a new one go in
bring<00:04:17.120> it

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
bring it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.110 
bring it
in<00:04:18.760> our

heylook<00:04:38.490> gets<00:04:38.729> off<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.090> ground<00:04:39.590> that's<00:04:40.590> where

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
heylook gets off the ground that's where

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.920 
heylook gets off the ground that's where
it's<00:04:41.039> supposed<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.460> eat

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
it's supposed to eat

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.810 
it's supposed to eat
hopefully<00:04:43.650> where<00:04:43.860> it'll<00:04:44.039> say<00:04:44.250> hopefully

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
hopefully where it'll say hopefully

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.070 
hopefully where it'll say hopefully
right

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.110 

pretty<00:04:49.560> cool

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
pretty cool

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.750 
pretty cool
I<00:04:51.440> think<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.500> might<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:52.710> pushed<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.160> down

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
I think I might have pushed it down

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:05.460 
I think I might have pushed it down
fill<00:04:55.450> her<00:04:55.600> up<00:04:55.920> that's<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:56.980> good<00:04:57.160> thing

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:15.159 

is<00:05:06.470> there

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.649 

it's<00:05:15.409> dripping<00:05:15.949> out<00:05:16.039> all<00:05:16.310> right<00:05:16.490> right<00:05:17.389> there

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
it's dripping out all right right there

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.100 
it's dripping out all right right there
I<00:05:18.340> think<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.610> might<00:05:19.789> be<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:20.150> rear<00:05:20.360> seal<00:05:20.749> on<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
I think it might be the rear seal on the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.450 
I think it might be the rear seal on the
transmission<00:05:22.930> Homer

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.810 

we<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.610> force<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.910> job<00:05:30.370> this<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.670> old

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
we can force a job this is the old

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.970 
we can force a job this is the old
transmission<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.260> seal<00:05:33.500> they<00:05:33.710> think

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
transmission that the seal they think

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.740 
transmission that the seal they think
might<00:05:34.250> be<00:05:34.400> bad<00:05:34.610> on<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:34.970> new<00:05:35.090> one<00:05:35.240> because<00:05:35.390> the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
might be bad on the new one because the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.560 
might be bad on the new one because the
transmission<00:05:36.290> set<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:37.010> long<00:05:37.220> no<00:05:38.030> see

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
transmission set so long no see

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.600 
transmission set so long no see
so<00:05:39.140> apparently<00:05:39.530> there's<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.890> sensor<00:05:40.340> that's

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
so apparently there's a sensor that's

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.490 
so apparently there's a sensor that's
supposed<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.970> go<00:05:41.090> through<00:05:41.330> here<00:05:41.690> which

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
supposed to go through here which

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.200 
supposed to go through here which
connects<00:05:42.950> down<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.340> there<00:05:43.460> or<00:05:43.610> something<00:05:43.820> and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
connects down in there or something and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.720 
connects down in there or something and
they<00:05:44.900> forgot<00:05:45.170> to<00:05:45.230> hook<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.590> up<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.520> the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
they forgot to hook that up this is the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.910 
they forgot to hook that up this is the
old<00:05:46.850> transmission<00:05:47.240> that's<00:05:48.020> why<00:05:48.200> we're

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
old transmission that's why we're

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.910 
old transmission that's why we're
thinking<00:05:48.950> why<00:05:49.370> it<00:05:49.490> won't<00:05:49.610> start<00:05:50.410> so<00:05:51.410> they<00:05:51.800> got

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
thinking why it won't start so they got

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
thinking why it won't start so they got
to<00:05:51.980> take<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:52.190> down<00:05:52.280> again<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:52.550> they<00:05:52.730> put<00:05:52.910> that

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
to take it down again so they put that

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.280 
to take it down again so they put that
in<00:05:53.180> one<00:05:53.870> smile<00:05:55.480> they're<00:05:56.480> quitting<00:05:56.810> for<00:05:57.140> the
