00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
hi this is Rick with Gardens by Rick and

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.379 
hi this is Rick with Gardens by Rick and
I'm<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> show<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> plant<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
I'm going to show you how to plant in a

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.160 
I'm going to show you how to plant in a
large<00:00:03.629> container<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.380> save<00:00:04.740> some<00:00:05.040> soil<00:00:09.170> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
large container and save some soil the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.669 
large container and save some soil the
best<00:00:10.590> way<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> have<00:00:10.920> found<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.809> save<00:00:12.809> space<00:00:13.380> in

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
best way I have found to save space in

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.550 
best way I have found to save space in
large<00:00:13.980> containers<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.360> use<00:00:15.750> packing

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
large containers is to use packing

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.630 
large containers is to use packing
peanuts<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.160> any<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> large<00:00:18.359> styrofoam

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
peanuts or any kind of large styrofoam

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.830 
peanuts or any kind of large styrofoam
pieces<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:21.000> sometimes<00:00:21.359> come<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
pieces that sometimes come in the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.230 
pieces that sometimes come in the
packaging<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.100> buy<00:00:23.279> electronic<00:00:23.939> items

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
packaging when you buy electronic items

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.300 
packaging when you buy electronic items
and<00:00:24.570> other<00:00:24.630> items<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.289> shipped<00:00:25.920> across

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and other items that are shipped across

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
and other items that are shipped across
these<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:27.029> big<00:00:27.390> chunks<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.930> styrofoam

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
these and have big chunks of styrofoam

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
these and have big chunks of styrofoam
the<00:00:29.250> reason<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.789> using<00:00:30.029> styrofoam<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the reason I like using styrofoam is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.200 
the reason I like using styrofoam is
because<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.710> styrofoam<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.790> decompose

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
because the styrofoam does not decompose

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200 
because the styrofoam does not decompose
in<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.170> stops<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
in time it stops it from going into the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
in time it stops it from going into the
landfills<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> taking<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.680> space<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.219> other

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
landfills and taking up space and other

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.760 
landfills and taking up space and other
areas<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> aren't<00:00:39.239> good<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.559> really

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
areas that aren't good and it's really

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
areas that aren't good and it's really
useful<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.879> light<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
useful because it's very light and it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.200 
useful because it's very light and it
makes<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> pot<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.920> heavy<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.030> use

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
makes the pot not so heavy too to use

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
makes the pot not so heavy too to use
and<00:00:45.510> work<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.800> works<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.129> I've

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and work with and it works well I've

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.510 
and work with and it works well I've
never<00:00:47.640> had<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> problem<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.129> basically<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
never had a problem and basically you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
never had a problem and basically you
get<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:50.879> pot<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> plant

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
get your pot that you're going to plant

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
get your pot that you're going to plant
in<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> times<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:53.670> large<00:00:53.940> tall

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
in a lot of times they're large tall

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
in a lot of times they're large tall
urns<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.250> soil

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
urns and you don't need that much soil

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.910 
urns and you don't need that much soil
for<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.820> plants<00:00:56.879> roots<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> grow<00:00:57.690> properly<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
for the plants roots to grow properly so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
for the plants roots to grow properly so
fill<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> bottom<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.449> pieces<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.989> broken

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
fill the bottom with pieces of broken

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.729 
fill the bottom with pieces of broken

of the styrofoam nature fill it up to at

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
of the styrofoam nature fill it up to at
least<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.330> level<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:13.020> where<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.590> plants

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

thought<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> plant<00:01:18.750> has<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> low

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
thought about the if the plant has a low

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.240 
thought about the if the plant has a low

level of soil that the plant needs to
properly<00:01:40.170> live<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> add<00:01:42.600> your
