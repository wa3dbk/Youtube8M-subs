00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.350
 a little beetle crawls in one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.069
 big computer and puts the whole system 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.170
 lame 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 the beetle is removed and the system 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.219
 works again or something like that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.769
 The legend saw the first bugfixing 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 but what if he had 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.920
 pines system would have remained and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 thus completely new to the computer 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 would have been awarded as functions 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 feature has been designated 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.510
 in our video special we show you 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.310
 mistakes in computer games the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.140
 gave new directions to the industry and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.859
 partly the way to play perfect 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 have changed 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 the heroine of the tomb raider series lara 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.100
 croft is even known to people who otherwise 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.790
 not much with video games too 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.070
 do have 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 not least because of her special 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 lush decollete there is the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.550
 acrobatic heroes in the mid 90s 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.260
 many people in the memory 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 At the same time, Lager's femininity should be initially 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 seems not so colossally 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 an accidental ends of the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.170
 designers toby gard blew campers 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.059
 bust around 150 percent on what its 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.129
 All male colleagues approve 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.859
 and become the top marketing tool of the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 tomb raider series developed 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.110
 Meanwhile, Lara's breasts were there 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 back to a realistic level 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 shrunk but that by one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.330
 slip up with the mouse 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.960
 Picture will be forever in the mind of any gamer 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 stay in memory are you still there space 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.780
 Invaders is probably one of the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 most influential play of the story 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.710
 but the market does not have the shoot 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.900
 just a completely new genre invented 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 the developer tomohiro uni chicago 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.799
 He broke his head like he did 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 his game is fluid and in reasonable 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 get up and running speed 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 should also be a high end hardware setup 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.180
 brought the alien invasion 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.490
 not to move faster where 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 the game became too simple after all 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 but he noticed one test 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 interesting effect the more opponents of the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.320
 play the less pixel 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 had to be calculated by it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.590
 the remaining fine faster 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.079
 move though not so planned 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 was not there and invented 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.969
 right next to the rising one 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 level of difficulty in games 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.729
 earlier it was not common for that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 developers were named in credits 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.899
 that fit monroe but does not bind 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.439
 and so he hid his name in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.520
 game adventure for the atari 2600 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.050
 through a particular sequence of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.770
 actions, the player could have a room 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.140
 find the lettering 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.760
 Vienna included as atari of it 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.350
 mitbekam the game was already 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.260
 appeared and cabinet already at one 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.790
 other employer the hidden room 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.980
 was the first easter egg of the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.970
 Game history and founded a trend 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.190
 that lasts until today 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.570
 almost every game has since somewhere 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 hid cross references to the 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.610
 Developers or funny gags fogged 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.040
 the first tweet koliska suisa hashimoto 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.470
 he owed that he should play kate 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 radius wn export desperate one 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.610
 test phase but because of the box heavy 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.200
 salt graffin as well as intended for many 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.630
 others could not be overcome 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.520
 So he came up with a code 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.770
 he uses his spaceship with the palette 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.390
 he could start a power- ups 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.220
 forgot the code at the end though 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 again removed from the top thereby 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.270
 the familiar key combination high 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.760
 down down left right left right 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.770
 Bh and state to great celebrity 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.850
 arrived and companies took konami 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.740
 code became known 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.540
 since then this code is not only in 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.130
 implemented countless video games 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.050
 but will also like in websites 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.160
 hidden and in other media 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.160
 you find allusion to it 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.080
 published in 1991 beat'em up street 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.300
 fighter 2 the world borea movies 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 developer naughty takafumi so on that 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.330
 it was possible some kill animation 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.250
 to break off by simply 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.840
 while a new attack began 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.090
 As a result , he has no time for the enemy 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.530
 but to fight back from amis so was 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.390
 also think that it will be for later 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.670
 technically too demanding would be such 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.840
 effectively string together attacks and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.610
 let the mistake in the game 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 these days are fast 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.150
 consecutive attacks quite normal 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.150
 and are called combos 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.490
 in real life , there is probably little 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.080
 sense a rocket launcher on your own 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.850
 feet to set and squeeze 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.740
 in games like doom or quake was 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.180
 But with it a very own kind of 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.460
 invented wayward 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.470
 the rocket jump is from arena shooter 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.840
 no longer indispensable and founded 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.730
 a mistake of a game physics the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.620
 Developers do not make such bugs 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.510
 but even integrated them into the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.690
 Game mechanics which multiplayer games 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.640
 a whole new complexity was also 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.980
 Steve Jobs Barney hopping or ski 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.690
 Formerly based on bugs and become 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.690
 used professionally in sports today 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.830
 Grand Theft Auto is for every player 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.540
 concept originally was the highest 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.950
 successful game series but not at all 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.830
 look like they do today 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.390
 the developers of the first gti worked 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.670
 actually called in a racing game 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.770
 race in chase in which the player of 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.050
 The police stopped and a penalty 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.690
 if he should pay 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.370
 speed limit exceeded 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.169
 the ki of the police, however, fuller 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.060
 mistake which causes them repeatedly in the 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.669
 player powers and thus a huge 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.990
 chaos hosted plays esther 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.640
 did not concentrate anymore 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.780
 that on the original games 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.820
 to play imaginary ways 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.900
 but tried as much harm as 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.700
 possible to do 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.620
 the complete gameplay became 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.240
 then designed for this bug and 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.240
 the rest is grand theft auto history 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.220
 the action-adventure onimusha for the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.030
 Playstation 2 also had some with it 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.560
 fight bugs 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.620
 thus indicates an error in the fight 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.130
 physics possible opponents with fast 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.880
 successive attacks in the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.980
 to keep air 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.600
 this effect appealed to the developers 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.610
 but not because he is not in that 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.010
 realistic onimusha universe fit 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.510
 But fun already does it and so on 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.580
 capcom created a perfect 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.800
 stand alone brand on this 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.430
 former back building devil may cry 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.430
 was born 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.590
 in the development of the well-known team 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.260
 shooter team fortress for the modern 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.630
 Robin Walker John Cook and a colleague 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.490
 a small mistake led to the back 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.260
 to the fact that opposing players participated 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.180
 the color of your own team 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.460
 which made you a member 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.960
 the own team could hold the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.580
 mistake it was fixed but he 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.730
 also serves as inspiration for one 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.410
 completely new classes to the spy 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.850
 his skills are among others 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.890
 as a player of the opposing team 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.090
 to dress and so the enemy 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.280
 to infiltrate rows 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.020
 this principle has been used in many others 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.630
 play copied and set up speak 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.400
 an error in the program code 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.620
 there are a lot of weird and eerie ones 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.540
 annoying grow computer games but only 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.770
 few have managed to create new genres 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.720
 create or basic 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.420
 Game mechanics on today almost all 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.190
 we have to build up games 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.780
 which forget writes us in the 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.730
 comment area which bugs yours 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.330
 opinion after the title feature really 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.330
 earned
