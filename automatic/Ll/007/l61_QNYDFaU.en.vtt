opponent to now Jason Kidd the head
coach<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.160> it's<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.520> interesting

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
coach I think it's a very interesting

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.610 
coach I think it's a very interesting
challenge<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:36.630> mean<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.870> think<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.440> the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
challenge i mean i think that the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.920 
challenge i mean i think that the
players<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.010> older<00:01:38.430> players<00:01:38.670> Garnett<00:01:39.510> Pierce

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
players or older players Garnett Pierce

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
players or older players Garnett Pierce
are<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.550> ton<00:01:41.760> of<00:01:41.790> respect<00:01:42.090> for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
are going to have a ton of respect for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.070 
are going to have a ton of respect for
him<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.600> they're<00:01:42.660> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:43.050> of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
him and I think they're going to kind of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.140 
him and I think they're going to kind of
make<00:01:43.260> sure<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:44.010> respect<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> followed

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
make sure that that respect is followed

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.850 
make sure that that respect is followed
in<00:01:45.210> line<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:46.080> talking<00:01:46.230> about<00:01:46.500> older

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
in line but as we're talking about older

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.110 
in line but as we're talking about older
players<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> Mets<00:01:47.910> fans

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
players and know a lot of Mets fans

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.900 
players and know a lot of Mets fans
their<00:01:48.840> concern<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.410> age<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:50.400> then<00:01:50.550> we<00:01:50.760> also

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
their concern is age and then we also

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.520 
their concern is age and then we also
have<00:01:51.060> injuries<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.080> have<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> older

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
have injuries so we have the older

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.810 
have injuries so we have the older
players<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.100> want<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> keep<00:01:53.490> away<00:01:53.790> from

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
players that you want to keep away from

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
players that you want to keep away from
injuries<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.870> we<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.590> some

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
injuries but we also do have some

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
injuries but we also do have some
players<00:01:56.010> with<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> nets<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.180> coming

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
players with the nets that are coming

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
players with the nets that are coming
back<00:01:57.720> off<00:01:57.960> injuries<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.410> Brook<00:01:58.680> Lopez<00:01:58.920> Deron

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
back off injuries got Brook Lopez Deron

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.010 
back off injuries got Brook Lopez Deron
Williams<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.660> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.900> be<00:02:00.960> very

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
Williams so it's going to be very

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
Williams so it's going to be very
interesting<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.370> works

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
interesting to see how all that works

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
interesting to see how all that works
out<00:02:02.790> how<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.750> factors<00:02:04.230> in<00:02:04.440> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
out how do you think that factors in to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.230 
out how do you think that factors in to
the<00:02:05.010> Brooklyn<00:02:05.310> Nets<00:02:05.430> season<00:02:05.820> worrying<00:02:06.150> about

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the Brooklyn Nets season worrying about

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.930 
the Brooklyn Nets season worrying about
both<00:02:06.570> age<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.170> injury<00:02:07.890> yeah<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.610> certainly

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
both age and injury yeah it's certainly

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
both age and injury yeah it's certainly
a<00:02:09.000> huge<00:02:09.180> factor<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.570> mean<00:02:09.780> especially<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.410> me

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
a huge factor I mean especially to me

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
a huge factor I mean especially to me
Darren<00:02:10.979> Darren<00:02:11.550> Williams<00:02:11.730> ankles<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.480> he

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
said that he's a hundred percent

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870 
said that he's a hundred percent
and<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.590> they<00:02:14.770> had<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> play<00:02:15.220> tomorrow<00:02:15.580> or

and that if they had to play tomorrow or
play<00:02:16.060> tonight<00:02:16.360> he'd<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.930> fine<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.380> he'd<00:02:17.530> be

even joe johnson Johnson said he's
100-percent<00:02:35.230> with<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:35.890> plantar<00:02:36.280> fasciitis

100-percent with this plantar fasciitis

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.850

but you know there are three key guys

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.830 
but you know there are three key guys
from<00:02:39.490> last<00:02:39.520> year's<00:02:39.910> team<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.540> are<00:02:40.660> already

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
from last year's team that are already

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.290 
from last year's team that are already
dealing<00:02:41.320> with<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.160> injury<00:02:42.520> question<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.210> we

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
dealing with the injury question and we

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.720 
dealing with the injury question and we
haven't<00:02:43.480> even<00:02:43.540> started<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.020> season<00:02:44.200> so

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
haven't even started the season so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.880 
haven't even started the season so
certainly<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.850> concern<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:47.290> me<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.470> think<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
certainly a concern to me I think the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.260 
certainly a concern to me I think the
biggest<00:02:48.010> concern<00:02:48.520> though<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.760> Deron<00:02:49.180> Williams

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
biggest concern though is Deron Williams

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.170 
biggest concern though is Deron Williams
ankles<00:02:50.130> thankfully<00:02:51.130> he<00:02:51.280> said<00:02:51.550> he's<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> hundred

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.460 
ankles thankfully he said he's a hundred
percent<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.750> we'll<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.050> take<00:02:53.140> his<00:02:53.260> word

percent and we'll have to take his word
for<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.740> but<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.280> certainly<00:02:54.640> something<00:02:54.880> you

think that's going to be kids job in

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.190 
think that's going to be kids job in
managing<00:03:06.880> those<00:03:07.030> minutes<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.600> making<00:03:08.020> sure

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
managing those minutes and making sure

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.420

that<00:03:08.380> these<00:03:08.500> guys<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.740> healthy<00:03:09.130> down<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that these guys are healthy down the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.370 
that these guys are healthy down the
stretch<00:03:09.640> because<00:03:09.940> sure<00:03:10.810> they're<00:03:11.020> older<00:03:11.350> and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
stretch because sure they're older and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.960 
stretch because sure they're older and
sure<00:03:11.740> they've<00:03:11.920> got<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> ton<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.460> mileage<00:03:12.850> on

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
sure they've got a ton of mileage on

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.670 
sure they've got a ton of mileage on
those<00:03:13.150> knees<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:14.170> was<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.560> up<00:03:14.620> to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
those knees but it was going to be up to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.740 
those knees but it was going to be up to
Jason<00:03:14.890> Kidd<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.610> luckily<00:03:15.970> they<00:03:16.360> do<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.720> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
Jason Kidd and luckily they do have a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.360 
Jason Kidd and luckily they do have a
deep<00:03:16.990> bench<00:03:17.200> they've<00:03:17.530> got<00:03:17.740> guys<00:03:17.890> that<00:03:17.950> come

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
deep bench they've got guys that come

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
deep bench they've got guys that come
off<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.640> bench<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.090> help<00:03:19.480> fill<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.440> I

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
off the bench and help fill in so I

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.020 
off the bench and help fill in so I
think<00:03:20.590> that's<00:03:20.950> going<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.130> be<00:03:21.280> kids<00:03:21.520> proc<00:03:21.820> top

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
think that's going to be kids proc top

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.760 
think that's going to be kids proc top
priority<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.570> managing<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
priority is managing you know the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.110 
priority is managing you know the
minutes<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.190> making<00:03:24.459> sure<00:03:24.580> these<00:03:24.730> guys<00:03:24.910> are

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
minutes and making sure these guys are

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.160 
minutes and making sure these guys are
healthy<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:26.590> know<00:03:27.520> they're<00:03:28.390> aware<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.870> it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
healthy but I know they're aware of it

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.300 
healthy but I know they're aware of it
so<00:03:29.410> as<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.180> going<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.360> be<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> problem<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:33.010> can

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
so as is it going to be a problem it can

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.740 
so as is it going to be a problem it can
be<00:03:33.520> but<00:03:33.730> they're<00:03:33.910> certainly<00:03:34.090> aware<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.690> and

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
be but they're certainly aware of it and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.699 
be but they're certainly aware of it and
it's<00:03:34.810> something<00:03:35.110> they're<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.380> work<00:03:35.470> on

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
it's something they're going to work on

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.650 
it's something they're going to work on
that<00:03:36.010> kid<00:03:36.250> already<00:03:36.400> talked<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.910> Garnett<00:03:37.390> about

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that kid already talked to Garnett about

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.290 
that kid already talked to Garnett about
him<00:03:38.140> not<00:03:38.380> playing<00:03:38.709> back<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.160> backs<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.640> kg

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
him not playing back to backs and kg

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.150 
him not playing back to backs and kg
said<00:03:40.570> that<00:03:41.200> conversation<00:03:41.770> didn't<00:03:41.980> go<00:03:42.010> too

said that conversation didn't go too

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.580 
said that conversation didn't go too
well<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:43.030> can<00:03:43.270> only<00:03:43.420> imagine<00:03:43.600> how<00:03:44.530> that

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
well so I can only imagine how that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
well so I can only imagine how that
exactly<00:03:45.250> when<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:45.820> when<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.330> look<00:03:46.540> at<00:03:46.690> this

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
exactly when but when you look at this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.530 
exactly when but when you look at this
team<00:03:47.170> Tom<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.459> aspirations<00:03:49.060> are<00:03:49.180> obviously

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
Berlin what does his team have to do in

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.699 
Berlin what does his team have to do in
order<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:58.060> successful<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.930> reach<00:03:59.530> that

June<00:04:01.870> yeah<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.440> know<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.590> think<00:04:02.950> chemistry<00:04:03.430> is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
June yeah you know I think chemistry is

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.130 
June yeah you know I think chemistry is
a<00:04:03.760> big<00:04:03.910> key<00:04:04.120> they<00:04:04.480> got<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.750> find<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.020> right

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
a big key they got to find the right

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900 
a big key they got to find the right
chemistry<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.280> think<00:04:06.459> one<00:04:06.640> thing<00:04:06.670> that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
chemistry and I think one thing that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.760 
chemistry and I think one thing that
they<00:04:07.239> need<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.570> be<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:07.930> what<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.230> thing<00:04:08.590> the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
they need to be and what the thing the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.800 
they need to be and what the thing the
fans<00:04:08.950> need<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.280> be<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.489> patient<00:04:09.940> because<00:04:10.630> here

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
fans need to be is patient because here

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.940 
fans need to be is patient because here
you<00:04:10.930> are<00:04:10.959> new<00:04:11.560> coach<00:04:11.860> pretty<00:04:12.610> much<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:13.200> new<00:04:14.200> set

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
you are new coach pretty much a new set

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.090 
you are new coach pretty much a new set
of<00:04:15.070> core<00:04:15.340> players<00:04:15.870> kg<00:04:16.870> Pierce<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:17.440> also<00:04:17.590> Terry

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
of core players kg Pierce but also Terry

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.159 
of core players kg Pierce but also Terry
Caroline<00:04:18.730> go<00:04:18.910> off<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.180> bench<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:19.930> you've<00:04:20.049> got

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
Caroline go off the bench so you've got

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.570 
Caroline go off the bench so you've got
a<00:04:20.200> lot<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.440> new<00:04:20.590> players<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:21.010> have<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.459> be

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
a lot of new players you have to be

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.400 
a lot of new players you have to be
patient<00:04:21.790> with<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:22.270> team<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.080> think<00:04:23.200> as

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
patient with this team so I think as

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.990 
patient with this team so I think as
long<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:23.860> they're<00:04:24.039> patient<00:04:24.460> let<00:04:24.789> themselves

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
long as they're patient let themselves

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.629 
long as they're patient let themselves
work<00:04:25.510> through<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.810> problems<00:04:26.430> find<00:04:27.430> that

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
work through the problems find that

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.999 
work through the problems find that
right<00:04:27.849> chemistry<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.689> of<00:04:29.319> course<00:04:29.560> down<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
right chemistry and of course down the

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.409 
right chemistry and of course down the
stretch<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.520> when<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:30.789> really<00:04:30.999> want<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.300> make

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
stretch is when you really want to make

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.909 
stretch is when you really want to make
sure<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.810> they're<00:04:31.960> bonded<00:04:32.409> they've<00:04:32.620> got<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
sure that they're bonded they've got the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.020 
sure that they're bonded they've got the
chemistry<00:04:33.430> they're<00:04:33.610> hitting<00:04:33.849> their<00:04:33.999> stride

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
chemistry they're hitting their stride

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.959 
chemistry they're hitting their stride
so<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:34.990> think<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.349> key<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:36.279> be<00:04:36.729> patient

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
so I think the key is to be patient

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.850 
so I think the key is to be patient
early<00:04:37.569> and<00:04:37.779> make<00:04:38.110> sure<00:04:38.139> they<00:04:38.379> can<00:04:38.529> find<00:04:38.740> that

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
early and make sure they can find that

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.809 
early and make sure they can find that
chemistry<00:04:39.189> and<00:04:39.310> that's<00:04:39.430> something<00:04:39.639> they've

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
chemistry and that's something they've

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.860 
chemistry and that's something they've
said<00:04:40.029> they're<00:04:40.150> working<00:04:40.509> on<00:04:40.599> and<00:04:40.659> that's

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
said they're working on and that's

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.420 
said they're working on and that's
another<00:04:41.229> reason<00:04:41.349> why<00:04:41.650> they're<00:04:41.949> going<00:04:42.159> to<00:04:42.219> Duke

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
another reason why they're going to Duke

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.309 
another reason why they're going to Duke
this<00:04:42.610> week<00:04:42.849> is<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.389> take<00:04:43.659> the<00:04:43.810> team<00:04:44.020> away<00:04:44.289> from

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
this week is to take the team away from

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.769 
this week is to take the team away from
the<00:04:44.740> media<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.159> New<00:04:45.279> York<00:04:45.430> media<00:04:45.610> put<00:04:46.449> them<00:04:46.569> in

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
the media the New York media put them in

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.899 
the media the New York media put them in
you<00:04:47.139> know<00:04:47.259> a<00:04:47.289> college<00:04:48.129> town<00:04:48.430> where<00:04:48.789> they're

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
you know a college town where they're

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.149 
you know a college town where they're
together<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:50.080> know<00:04:50.199> hotel<00:04:50.620> rooms<00:04:50.860> side<00:04:51.099> by

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
together you know hotel rooms side by

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.100 
together you know hotel rooms side by
side<00:04:51.610> instead<00:04:51.939> of<00:04:52.060> going<00:04:52.330> home<00:04:52.360> back<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.870> their

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
side instead of going home back to their

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.869 
side instead of going home back to their
homes<00:04:53.319> so<00:04:53.979> they're<00:04:54.129> really<00:04:54.310> going<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.580> work<00:04:54.699> on

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
homes so they're really going to work on

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.369 
homes so they're really going to work on
that<00:04:54.999> chemistry<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.779> I<00:04:55.840> think<00:04:56.080> that's<00:04:56.229> going

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
that chemistry and I think that's going

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.600 
that chemistry and I think that's going
to<00:04:56.439> be<00:04:56.560> certainly<00:04:56.889> something<00:04:57.159> that's<00:04:57.279> key<00:04:57.580> for

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
to be certainly something that's key for

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.399 
to be certainly something that's key for
the<00:04:57.819> team<00:04:57.999> heard<00:04:58.629> from<00:04:58.810> Tom<00:04:58.960> Lorenzo

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
the team heard from Tom Lorenzo

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.860 
the team heard from Tom Lorenzo
chemistry<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.189> going<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.550> be<00:05:00.639> key<00:05:00.909> tour<00:05:01.719> de
