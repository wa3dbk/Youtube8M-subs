00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.470
 Halli hello and welcome to the first 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.230
 follow our fifa 15 road to glory 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.610
 We are back and want to see 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.799
 how long is this year by a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 before I decide again 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.350
 sometime to adjust it i hope 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 Of course that will take a long time 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.080
 or that may not be 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.250
 Of course, the big one will happen 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.990
 I hope I thought so anyway 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.619
 for a start in any case again 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.689
 demonstrate 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.650
 and many of you wanted to see it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.199
 that I will do it again 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 therefore definitely influenced 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 not too many against that do not know 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.840
 do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.110
 so you see here the first episode of the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 fifa 15 you did not happen that much 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.379
 and i want to add a few things 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.360
 you definitely see ours 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 get texts because we already played 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.559
 have of course and so on and so on 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 It did not start and it was not like that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.940
 bad my cinema the silly and kramer 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 that can be seen in any case of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 starter pack team and otherwise year 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 Let's see how we got there 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.469
 Building up can be the first consequence 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 of course only make up for it in the web 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 I have to wait until the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 This will be complete next week 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.630
 I have the game early though 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 access to the ps3 i can give you now 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 already say 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.869
 I already played it or runs 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.299
 there in the background but there really 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.240
 no games make ps3 technically old 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 because somehow I'm not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 I want to get used to all the gameplay 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 I'm already swinging the petri 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.360
 accustomed I can already tell us 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 a glaring difference in any case 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 to remember now that's why it is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.240
 In any case so that I stop that we 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 still wait with the gameplay until next 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.329
 week because I do not know if the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 next episode red I think so 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.020
 before Tuesday will be wednesday or 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 thursday if we can still do it 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 a second episode in the web app 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 then he gets the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600
 Of course and yes, first look like it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 even better if it arrives 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.270
 I did not want to see it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.610
 Of course not so often if 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 it will be good for you then we will 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 to do the whole thing regularly, of course 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.969
 that's always the case so that's me then 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.979
 It always decides from video to video like 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.340
 many people still want to watch 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.930
 how many times I do not do that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.390
 we pull our paxton the first 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.580
 strothmann in two packs has it 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.420
 you do not print quite as bad but now 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 also no case of infection in a pack 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.379
 You have to say in there you can open 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.840
 every case has much more luck than 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.150
 I now in the case but my starter 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.790
 packs were not good at all 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.129
 I think I had three accounts exactly 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.870
 on which I had packs and yes they were 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.360
 all pretty modest that actually 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 so we do not have to be around that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.690
 pap beat about the true nix therefore 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.220
 yes, after all, there are but so you can 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.420
 Of course, the first circle 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.489
 put together if you can do it all 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 you can then sell one of them 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.470
 trade a bit or something like that but you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.980
 I 'll see that I'm a bit too 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.260
 not really that is not trading 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 really my case was this year 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.470
 I admit this is not my case was 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.799
 to kick but that also some 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.450
 had some problems and we therefore had 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.090
 here only those who just now the same 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
 unfortunately in the second couple of tg see god 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.180
 was broken with a few directly 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.530
 that is the second part if you 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.569
 look now would be the third 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.940
 already been the complete second 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.829
 part way by seeing how much 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.950
 All my players have sold 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.410
 and so on except for this first 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.090
 start as you see 60 and directly 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.829
 should then everything has sold as 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.500
 everything had taken what I am 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.000
 Unfortunately God needed the second one 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.980
 Patrick the complete second 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.010
 area you see my friend right away 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.930
 was a bit at the next change 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.609
 pity there has broken up against the file 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.709
 every case still thinks of it as 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.660
 tip every day to sign up you see 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.579
 now I have 1200 drives 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.190
 made some little something traded 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.260
 would have seen very, very bitter series 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 but yes that is unfortunately also gone 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.099
 I show you what I do in medical 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.290
 I had time 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.019
 bought me three premier league games 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.409
 they are all about release 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.919
 should go up in the price capella for 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:27.419
 3500 jobs for 1700 and animal for 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.650
 2300, they should all be for 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.690
 piece finds game is outside and then 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.390
 yes, really the first people all 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.890
 play and then really all really 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.180
 Then you want to have your players 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.710
 Favorite player, the prices rise 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.849
 all players every year still 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.349
 pretty tough 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.550
 and that should be this year too 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.140
 that 's my only one 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.169
 Small tip, even if it really 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.880
 Almost too late is that he is still 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.950
 cook put a few of the fast ones 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.380
 premier league player not appropriated 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.900
 and animal inventory or such are 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.820
 all still affordable and should 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.320
 actually to start then high 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.240
 go can I do as a small trailer 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.800
 But I have to say otherwise 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.590
 see if I can do after training 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.639
 from what I killed 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.830
 let's see I can not promise 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.110
 but yes, if you like nothing 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.450
 Of course we are looking forward to hearing about you 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.770
 appreciation of you, of course, look forward to seeing you 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.190
 hopefully at the next video again 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.190
 to 1
