00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.610
 yeah everyone knows today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 one is the king Puglia 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 so I have to talk to you about evil 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 headdress pockets you know the minecraft 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 that you have on your smartphone has 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 maybe you've never seen that yet 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.100
 even shocking because given the number 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.420
 of sales that they made in my opinion has 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.699
 hard to be printed in your 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.840
 head but also on consoles we're going a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.640
 little talk in numbers 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 because frankly it's shocking 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 can be compared a little to gta 5 to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.340
 which is here to show you 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.140
 just like what ya ya anyway 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880
 a great success with minecraft even a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 bigger and although I was five at the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.329
 total 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 of course difficult to compare when 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 has two games that did not come out in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.680
 same time a minecraft came out well 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.700
 before gta 5 comes out so we can not 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.469
 unlike compare but it's 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 just for you m here for you and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.610
 still a little vision of things 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 when you get a little categorized 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 a little bit of that we'll say here a little bit to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.760
 imagine that in your time your 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.250
 brain in your imagination to to 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.140
 just about right if you are to the importance of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 this game there malik west so here it's 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.130
 especially minecraft pocket 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 basically it's minecraft smartphone 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.630
 be it at apple so iguazu that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 for example samsung with style 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 this for example android so these are these 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.600
 two big platforms to which 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.610
 they made a lot of wind and I'm going 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.400
 give you the first number he 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.470
 this is 21 million sales since 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 these two operating systems that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.450
 of course systems 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.579
 operating here based on smartphone 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.159
 so the iphones or this is for example 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.900
 I do not know me I think the galaxy s 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 five chick stuff like that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 phones of this style here that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 in total minecraft were done he says 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.680
 well a little minecraft in a real game 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 say minecraft but sold themselves 21 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.570
 millions of copies and well 2 of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.050
 minecraft pocket how many are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 makes money thanks to its 2 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.720
 to these two different platforms because 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 that attention there are other platforms 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 also they made themselves 147 million 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 dollars of profits wow also knowing 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.650
 that the game so that the application in 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.530
 he himself sells it at $ 7 minecraft 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.540
 pocket weighed yesterday low that are not done 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.730
 badly they did not even 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.370
 bad money to 147 million dollars 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 profits so that's of course it's 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.720
 the developer so these kids with zinc or 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.130
 homogeneous moring that I think it's 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.210
 say like that I know that with my 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.710
 wish of my mouth on youtube of 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.940
 anyway that's always like that 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.920
 but I never really 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.300
 minecraft older but I always 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 seen this logo in orange 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.710
 but never did I tell myself how 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.300
 pronounce me I like I think we're going 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.370
 pronounce it like that I know it's not 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.320
 and so he formalized all of this on 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.870
 twitter the statistics actually 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.850
 so about these two platforms 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.190
 there either on ios or on android 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.700
 so in total 21 million copies 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.710
 sold either a profit of 147 million 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230
 dollars attention it's not 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.690
 finished because if you have to know too 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.810
 is that already the game on mobile has been 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.970
 created in 2011 and in May 2013 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.180
 ie we will say two years after 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.180
 the jean the game has been sold to 10 million 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.430
 of copies that is to say that here if we 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.860
 follows its not really proportional 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.570
 since we are going to say that it goes back 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.950
 faster and faster than two million 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.080
 about copies that is to say it 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 there is a big cadence earth all that same 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.540
 if this is what came out in 2011 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.860
 the app on ios or on android and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.080
 well it still works very well 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.000
 now we will give statistics 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.030
 about other platforms such as 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 pc mac linux the three assemblies because 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.920
 that low and it's the same thing except 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.570
 that this is not the end it's not sure 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.070
 under the same system leaves oite good 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.650
 it's a bit more complicated than that but 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.800
 in any case on the computer we go we go 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.390
 to house it like that it is sold at 14 7 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.480
 millions of copies it's normal 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.940
 it's one of the most 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.280
 sold because basel abbas minecraft is 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.050
 more a computer-based game 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.030
 computer i have a laptop 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.920
 a fixed or portable computer 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.440
 attention to the beautiful and the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.940
 statistics there is more game finally there 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.130
 has been more times sold on 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.460
 smartphones that on pc is shocking that 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.400
 jeans 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.290
 it is basic on pc out of 360 it is 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.520
 sold at 12 million and on ps3 at a 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 million copies 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.380
 if we do the math in total it is 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.650
 sold to 48.7 million copies 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.970
 50 million copies 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.050
 minecraft so if we can do a 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.900
 small magnifying glass for example as I you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.390
 I said pay attention to lightly with GTA 5 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.950
 basically i was worried about vlan at 30 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.960
 at 40 million they made themselves a lot 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.580
 more book just even though I know that 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.770
 it was not released at the same time 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540
 still a big impact with minecraft 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 I hope this video will have you 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.060
 you can tell me what you 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.800
 think of all that to have comments 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.640
 thank you put a little I loved the video 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.350
 it's super fun 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.490
 it was even if on the staff page 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.760
 payment of several relatives and 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.760
 few days
