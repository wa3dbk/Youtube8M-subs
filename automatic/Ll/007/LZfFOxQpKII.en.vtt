00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
this is Benson tram engineering we think

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.520 
this is Benson tram engineering we think
we<00:02:21.790> figured<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.209> out<00:02:22.329> Smith<00:02:22.989> killed<00:02:23.319> one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

a top notch oh yeah no no question i

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.589 
a top notch oh yeah no no question i
mean<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:37.030> one<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.239> those<00:02:37.329> games<00:02:37.450> that

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
mean it's it's one of those games that

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.819 
mean it's it's one of those games that
you<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.170> kind<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.349> play<00:02:38.439> in<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.650> good

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
you have to kind of play in a good

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.110 
you have to kind of play in a good
situation<00:02:38.980> because<00:02:39.489> if<00:02:39.579> you're<00:02:39.700> playing<00:02:39.879> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
situation because if you're playing it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.330 
situation because if you're playing it
with<00:02:40.239> noise<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.620> you're<00:02:41.950> gonna<00:02:42.010> miss

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
with noise around you you're gonna miss

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.509 
with noise around you you're gonna miss
so<00:02:42.730> much<00:02:42.959> faster<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> better<00:02:44.079> i<00:02:44.519> can

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
so much faster the better i can

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:57.880 
so much faster the better i can
something<00:02:45.879> crawling<00:02:46.090> around<00:02:46.269> out<00:02:46.510> there

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.690 

so<00:02:58.760> after<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.450> first<00:02:59.480> 45<00:03:00.340> I'm<00:03:01.340> absolutely

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700

gonna keep playing um I want to see how

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.590 
gonna keep playing um I want to see how
it<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:04.459> pans<00:03:04.670> out<00:03:04.910> once<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.270> other<00:03:05.390> story

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
it all pans out once the other story

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.900 
it all pans out once the other story
comes<00:03:05.870> together<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.380> want<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.740> see<00:03:06.950> hold<00:03:07.459> out<00:03:07.640> a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
comes together I want to see hold out a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.180 
comes together I want to see hold out a
little<00:03:08.330> bit<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> not<00:03:09.440> pessimism<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.040> don't

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
little bit of a not pessimism I don't

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.470 
little bit of a not pessimism I don't
know<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.400> feels<00:03:10.520> like<00:03:10.640> there<00:03:10.790> might<00:03:10.819> be<00:03:11.060> means

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
know it feels like there might be means

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.730 
know it feels like there might be means
if<00:03:11.569> there's<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> reason<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.140> some<00:03:12.470> people<00:03:12.680> are

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
if there's a reason that some people are

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.370 
if there's a reason that some people are
not<00:03:13.340> digging<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:14.570> i<00:03:14.870> think<00:03:15.110> i'm<00:03:15.200> going<00:03:15.290> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
not digging it but i think i'm going to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.440 
not digging it but i think i'm going to
enjoy<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.860> can't<00:03:16.550> wait<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> keep<00:03:17.000> playing<00:03:17.270> it

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
enjoy it I can't wait to keep playing it

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.900 
enjoy it I can't wait to keep playing it
but<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.020> can<00:03:18.230> see<00:03:18.800> where<00:03:19.040> some<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.580> could

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
but I can see where some of it could

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.910 
but I can see where some of it could
become<00:03:20.270> repetitive<00:03:20.510> exactly<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.560> been

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
become repetitive exactly it's been

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.590 
become repetitive exactly it's been
unique<00:03:22.670> enough<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.150> think<00:03:23.450> they'll

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
unique enough that I think they'll

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.570 
unique enough that I think they'll
probably<00:03:23.780> gonna<00:03:24.020> do<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.290> few<00:03:24.470> turns<00:03:24.800> in<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.070> keep

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
probably gonna do a few turns in it keep

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.180 
probably gonna do a few turns in it keep
playing<00:03:25.820> yep
