00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.890
 victory over fnatic in a few days 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.630
 the catch unexpectedly leaves the team and 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.880
 the rumors had to join 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.829
 big organization and it was true 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.990

 team having 0.77 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.610
 next day's playoff round he 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.760

 fnatic does not take a pause and visits the dreamhack 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.879
 vinter as potential 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.099
 winner however they were 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.019

 group stage in the fight for first place 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.060
