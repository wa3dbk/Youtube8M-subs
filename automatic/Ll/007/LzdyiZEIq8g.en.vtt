somebody actually two people from what I
seen<00:00:16.590> mentioned<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.820> unlocking<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
seen mentioned about unlocking the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.370 
seen mentioned about unlocking the
battery<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.430> letting<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> computer<00:00:21.270> kind<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
battery and letting the computer kind of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060 
battery and letting the computer kind of
reset<00:00:23.160> itself<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.710> went<00:00:25.710> ahead<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.890> did

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
reset itself so I went ahead and did

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.600 
reset itself so I went ahead and did
that<00:00:26.130> last<00:00:26.640> week<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:30.449> worked<00:00:31.430> once<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that last week and it worked once the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.729 
that last week and it worked once the
computer<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.120> reset<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.780> transmission<00:00:34.469> felt

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
computer was reset the transmission felt

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.459 
computer was reset the transmission felt
like<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.219> kind<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> re<00:00:36.110> sequencing<00:00:37.110> itself

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
like it was kind of re sequencing itself

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
like it was kind of re sequencing itself
and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.980> haven't<00:00:38.280> had<00:00:38.430> any<00:00:38.489> issue<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and I haven't had any issue with the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.330 
and I haven't had any issue with the
whole<00:00:40.969> thing<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.540> into<00:00:42.750> overdrive<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
whole thing going into overdrive so that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.020 
whole thing going into overdrive so that
worked<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> problem<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> I'm

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
worked for me the problem that I'm

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.310 
worked for me the problem that I'm
facing<00:00:48.210> today<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:50.300> my<00:00:51.300> car<00:00:51.510> started<00:00:52.050> doing<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
facing today is my car started doing a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.479 
facing today is my car started doing a
whole<00:00:52.440> bunch<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> other<00:00:52.829> electrical<00:00:53.309> things

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
whole bunch of other electrical things

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.569 
whole bunch of other electrical things
so<00:00:54.260> including<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.410> starting<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.250> did<00:00:56.460> not

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so including not starting it did not

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.510 
so including not starting it did not
start<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:58.350> being<00:00:58.559> said<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
start so that being said this kind of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010 
start so that being said this kind of
leads<00:00:59.670> me<00:00:59.730> into<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> second<00:01:00.480> comment<00:01:00.840> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
leads me into the second comment that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.119 
leads me into the second comment that
somebody<00:01:01.620> posted

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
somebody posted

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
somebody posted
I<00:01:03.439> removed<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> battery<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> terminals

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I removed the battery and the terminals

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.370 
I removed the battery and the terminals
are<00:01:08.210> really<00:01:09.210> corroded<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:12.299> knew<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> they

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
are really corroded I knew that they

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
are really corroded I knew that they
were<00:01:13.439> corroding<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> time<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
were corroding from time to time so I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.390 
were corroding from time to time so I
would<00:01:15.600> remove<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> corrosion<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
would remove the corrosion but the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.140 
would remove the corrosion but the
corrosion<00:01:17.729> keeps<00:01:18.390> coming<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.640> rapidly<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
corrosion keeps coming back rapidly so I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
corrosion keeps coming back rapidly so I
went<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> took<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> battery<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.470> there's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
went and took the battery out there's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.289 
went and took the battery out there's
still<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.670> corrosion<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.210> battery

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
still some corrosion on the battery

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.510 
still some corrosion on the battery
terminal<00:01:24.990> batteries<00:01:25.770> only<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.100> years<00:01:26.250> old

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
terminal batteries only two years old

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
terminal batteries only two years old
though<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> three<00:01:27.720> years<00:01:27.869> old<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.140> should

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
though going on three years old I should

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
though going on three years old I should
say<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.810> I'm<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> take<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
say and I'm going to take it the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
say and I'm going to take it the
intestine<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.549> still<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.210> good

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
intestine to see if it's still in good

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:33.830 
intestine to see if it's still in good
shape

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
shape

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
shape
but<00:01:34.710> other<00:01:35.040> than<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> find<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but other than that I'm going to find a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
but other than that I'm going to find a
way<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> clean<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> terminals<00:01:37.890> really

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
way to clean off the terminals really

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.649 
way to clean off the terminals really
good<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:40.200> ground<00:01:40.560> wire<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.659> somebody

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
good and that ground wire there somebody

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
good and that ground wire there somebody
said<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.040> comments<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.729> they

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
said in one of their comments that they

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
said in one of their comments that they
went<00:01:45.090> ahead<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.920> cleaned<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> off

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
went ahead and kind of cleaned that off

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
went ahead and kind of cleaned that off
and<00:01:47.520> whatnot<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.780> might<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and whatnot and there might just be a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.249 
and whatnot and there might just be a
connection<00:01:50.250> disrupting<00:01:50.909> snow<00:01:51.119> too<00:01:51.259> but

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
connection disrupting snow too but

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
connection disrupting snow too but
needless<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.740> same<00:01:53.090> resetting<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> computer

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
needless the same resetting the computer

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.740 
needless the same resetting the computer
did<00:01:54.930> solve<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.590> problem<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:57.030> far<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
did solve that problem as far as the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.030 
did solve that problem as far as the
shifting<00:01:58.229> goes<00:01:58.439> and<00:02:00.259> yeah<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
shifting goes and yeah it was like I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
shifting goes and yeah it was like I
said<00:02:02.100> about<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> week<00:02:02.490> strong<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
said about a week strong and then all of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
said about a week strong and then all of
a<00:02:03.719> sudden<00:02:03.750> today<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> start

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a sudden today it did not want to start

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.089 
a sudden today it did not want to start
I<00:02:05.579> went<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.689> unlock<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> doors<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> car

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
I went to go unlock the doors to the car

it's<00:04:18.220> at<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> place<00:04:18.640> but<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.180> been<00:04:19.359> sitting

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
it's at a place but it's been sitting

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.240 
it's at a place but it's been sitting
like<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:19.989> for<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.230> long<00:04:20.440> time<00:04:20.830> so<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.100> don't

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
like this for a long time so I don't

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.720 
like this for a long time so I don't
know<00:04:21.310> exactly<00:04:21.459> where<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.030> goes<00:04:23.730> because

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
know exactly where it goes because

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.280 
know exactly where it goes because
that's<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.750> connect<00:04:26.140> to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
that's that's got to connect to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.850 
that's that's got to connect to
something<00:04:26.710> right<00:04:26.830> there<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:31.650> don't<00:04:32.650> know

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
something right there I don't know

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:43.420

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
okay go ahead and give it a try now both

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:58.080 
okay go ahead and give it a try now both
terminals<00:04:44.210> again<00:04:44.630> are<00:04:44.720> connected<00:04:45.200> tight

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:09.950 

that's<00:04:59.090> better

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960

possibly

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.920 

all<00:06:08.260> right<00:06:08.410> we'll<00:06:08.620> let<00:06:08.710> it<00:06:08.770> run<00:06:08.980> for<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.190> while

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
all right we'll let it run for a while

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.930 
all right we'll let it run for a while
of<00:06:10.930> course<00:06:11.200> I'll<00:06:11.380> take<00:06:11.530> it<00:06:11.710> out<00:06:11.940> again

everything's<00:06:14.100> computers<00:06:15.100> going<00:06:15.220> to<00:06:15.280> be<00:06:15.400> reset

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
everything's computers going to be reset

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.350 
everything's computers going to be reset
again<00:06:16.950> so<00:06:17.950> I<00:06:18.250> guess<00:06:18.490> we'll<00:06:18.670> try<00:06:18.850> it<00:06:18.880> again<00:06:19.000> see

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
again so I guess we'll try it again see

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:35.160 
again so I guess we'll try it again see
if<00:06:19.390> that<00:06:19.600> shifting<00:06:20.290> thing<00:06:20.560> stays<00:06:20.860> away<00:06:34.170> all

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
if that shifting thing stays away all

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.000 
if that shifting thing stays away all
