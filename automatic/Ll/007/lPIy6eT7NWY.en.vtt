00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the most important equipment 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.779
 for vehicle operation on 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 battery does not stay the eyes of the driver 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.530
 making it often 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.750
 forgotten by the driver 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 I see why not neglect the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 accessory mainly in the cold the heat 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.270
 the battery it is not so require the vehicle 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 went live easily 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 when in winter this battery is required 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 a little more because engine oil is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 and therefore denser by it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.829
 is already weak and damaged in the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 heat it lapses in the cold 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.090
 the main care that would keep the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.969
 battery attached to the vehicle mount 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.300
 keep the battery connectors 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.670
 clean and always observe the outside 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.129
 general cleaning of the battery, which can 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 electrical shock to the batteries is the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 battery will be discharged 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.879
 this occurs because the alternator fails 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 failed component installed 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.370
 Electronic vehicle that has not been done 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.899
 by trained professional is and demand 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 a large chain leak 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.670
 in such cases the owner must 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.340
 look for a high in this specialized 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.799
 confidence to correct the system of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.180
 departure system charging system 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 vehicle power 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 the battery life may vary 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 according to the use of the product you 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 uses deep discharge battery 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 to hear sound to use accessories 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.579
 battery life will get very 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.700
 reduced 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.310
 today the market requires some equipment 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 that can evaluate the battery life 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.250
 not with 100% accuracy but 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.950
 to bring the driver a knowledge 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.619
 how long is the battery life? 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.820
 The important factor is always to observe the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 vehicle dashboard 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 to give some Portuguese in Mali on the panel 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.890
 driver must stop immediately and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.799
 look for a specialist workshop that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.280
 will leave on a trip and take time to return 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.770
 about 10 days you should turn off the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.030
 negative battery cable so that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.860
 battery will not have a high 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.770
 download the moment you need it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.170
 again on departure 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.680
 will fail this technical cover is for 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.410
 prevent the heat generated by the engine from 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.410
 car will affect the battery 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.640
 the famous transfer of cargo is in 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.430
 case of emergency you can do yes 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.680
 but there is the certain care to be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.860
 made to avoid short circuits is not 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.200
 the ideal is to take the car 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.950
 ideal electrical situation. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.950
 call a trash
