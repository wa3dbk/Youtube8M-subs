00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and then his other one is pick a card

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.119 
and then his other one is pick a card
which<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.940> far<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.750> works<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.859> like

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
which as far as I know works a bit like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
which as far as I know works a bit like
the<00:00:59.250> Webber<00:00:59.430> jack<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> I've<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.680> actually

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the Webber jack but I've not actually

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.119 
the Webber jack but I've not actually

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
can see which is really good but I think

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.490 
can see which is really good but I think
it's<00:03:10.120> because<00:03:10.209> I've<00:03:10.480> also<00:03:10.630> got<00:03:10.930> fire<00:03:11.200> Bayon

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
it's because I've also got fire Bayon

it's because I've also got fire Bayon
