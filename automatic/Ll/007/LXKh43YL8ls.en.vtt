00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.400
 ahrensburg alex as always here 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.220
 Welcome to another episode of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 because of league one in fifa 5 10 ultimate 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 team and as a little special for the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
 has the fifth follow I make the whole 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 Today, after commented film also 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 Pretty well celebrated before the quasi the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 right series is started and up 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.490
 every case at the team has nothing 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.110
 changed and we actually start 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.970
 directly into the first match 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.090
 now it takes forever until the opponent ob 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.590
 come on because I do not know 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.030
 opponent 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.580
 hi opponents because of a partnership 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 Latency has a shit athens man 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 the latency can see the work 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.750
 but at least a little bit like that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.650
 after when did eternity look for 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.450
 we get an opponent with one 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.430
 but the silver offering itself names 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.739
 provider goes against alex so 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.660
 let's finish the guy directly 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.920
 to start to try our expected 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.300
 opponents first properly fear 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.860
 make by breaking the latte 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.720
 but that is not the case 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.699
 succeeded as he imagined 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.659
 and now as I could but already 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.500
 but do not seem to smell coni 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.950
 now meet his very first 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.280
 attack creates a gate 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.370
 gp his first damn attack 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.380
 and he 'll let a gate go 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.140
 He does not give up. He does one 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580
 epic skyrun against any 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.680
 defenders do not accomplish this 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.650
 attack and then he shoots goalkeeper 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.300
 break the gate damn it 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.530
 then the opponent is the second time in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.630
 my half makes a flank 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.370
 not dangerous and how to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.900
 Hell, he creates a goal with the second 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:42.410
 shot that shit that illogical 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.980
 do not want you like by stupid 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.750
 not me 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.430
 after we first caught up properly 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.180
 the opponent still starts 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.480
 Attack would be work on the board sometimes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.100
 hold something is that so difficult 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.400
 but now after this gate comes the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.190
 Revenge the option chips and shoot 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 against the post from the distance can 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.250
 Do not even make a nice goal 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.900
 are games then there was first a 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.940
 for a long time nothing, no offense 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.950
 it was a small success and then 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.260
 shoot koné with a cola ball on goal 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.989
 The ball bounces off and on it you clown 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.540
 the stauber makes such gates 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.239
 shoot fifa fully handsome and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.590
 so after nothing with the eternity 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.780
 war is on the ball and 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.209
 He makes him pure on the types s 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.129
 ballast only three in twos of the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.129
 score we catch up 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.310
 I was sure we could do that 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.349
 still turn and then what is that why 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.819
 belongs to the ball not what right in front 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 The goalkeeper ball you just have to 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.510
 your foot or arm or something 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.550
 stretch out 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.040
 my goblet we put back with two 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.300
 gates behind shortly before closing I have 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.010
 the free kick out of each other not straight 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.630
 optimal position does not get you one 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.950
 just optimum protection and the ball 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.190
 which also is not purely 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.190
 but why is my player cheering why 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.769
 it is still much to three once was 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.140
 not yet in it 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.209
 mystical meanwhile we're in it though 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.239
 extremely tight so the whole is well 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.610
 but not so mystical 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.170
 that 's it from the match okay me 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 get that from the earthquake 14 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.100
 Had lost three have something now 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.540
 Change what we have to change is fine 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.340
 Of course we just need one clearly 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.319
 better team we get a clear 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.580
 better team kids through packs well ok 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.590
 actually not for my alex he is called 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.420
 you get in pécs but someone gets 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.250
 try it when I've now everyone 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.690
 fifth follow a few packets as two 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.430
 up to three pieces that may be for 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.930
 you look pretty good and I have 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.700
 maybe someday lucky and 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.380
 pull something good and from those players 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.910
 either we sell the or we 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.130
 Just join the team 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.560
 then we improve our team and then 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.810
 should that be with the much better team 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.579
 be feasible 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.200
 But now we come to the first 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.430
 three packs that I opened today 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.739
 and in the first pack whom we can pull 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.269
 lukaku lukaku not really 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.859
 bad because I believe that 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.980
 10,000 worth lukaku lukaku lukaku lukaku 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.299
 first basin my god we are lucky 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.829
 We have a bit of luck 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.620
 So the first sentences in the team and a 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.970
 the rest is yes of the two 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.739
 Players are somehow worthless under 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.269
 have another 1000 something very useful 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.510
 can and would be a few contracts there and 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.940
 the fitness and yes in any case 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.470
 very good pack and you see we have 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.419
 just as lucky in the second pack we 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.639
 get cardoso gp pusan 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.669
 and so on and so on one more sooner 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.240
 bad pack big shit 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.530
 this pack of shiny big chance and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 now in the last day we will 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.600
 certainly lucky again 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.699
 have and we draw relate rafael 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.530
 not yet my rare brilliant 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.810
 but we can play raphael 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.570
 also join the team for goliath 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.240
 the silver right-back and yes 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.970
 the rest is anything but 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.250
 Intoxicating to our mini packaging 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.449
 has only just under 6500 konz left and 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.190
 from the money necessarily want 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.870
 Computer scientists also commit to that 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.500
 fast to it and of course there came directly 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.190
 nu wu this type her in the sense 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.479
 After that, I also wanted one 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.009
 five-digit killer commit the 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.720
 Another good shot was there 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.509
 ben arfa actually the perfect solution 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.099
 So I bought McGeady higher 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.080
 fully the logic in the st 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.340
 then my team looked like that and 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.949
 Of course I want that directly too 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.560
 so let's go to the next match 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.330
 our opponent has under 78 themes 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.710
 with three players like ramsey 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.750
 sterling and aguero damn after about 27 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.039
 minutes back and forth in the middle field 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.750
 finally came my first shot on goal 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.620
 by lukaku but not really 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.479
 was dangerous 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.400
 shortly thereafter the enemy had to be 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.270
 very first attack but he only hits 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.090
 the post 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.740
 such a nonsense and now short or has 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.090
 her again with a small scandal 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.080
 with a car with and he will her 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.940
 clearly fisted but the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.050
 Schiri does not whistle and poked with full 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.360
 next to it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.150
 By the way, he has a little child in Lutz 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.590
 shot out of hand 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.120
 and now comes what must come the adversary 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.710
 made soccer and three or four times 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.270
 Defenders do not make it one 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.500
 single opponent to stop 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.940
 I definitely did not want to go with one 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.470
 to have a break in the break so have 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.389
 conny and lukaku thought flank themselves 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.720
 header so easy is that 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.340
 and thus it is 1 1 for eternity 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.900
 without dangerous action on both 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.460
 pages comes in the criminal law power 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.599
 a short trick and try the thing 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.810
 now in the corner after all 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:28.070
 shoots down today and now 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.300
 Let's come to a little quiz for 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.680
 in between how many ball contacts 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.280
 I need to my first gate to 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.259
 achieve 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.300
 a 1 b 5 or 10 7 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:46.099
 you have decided to count so 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:47.360
 We had simply times with 1 2 3 4 and 5 5 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.310
 the right answer if you are five 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.960
 typed that then you have just that 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.960
 nothing gained 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.240
 congratulations the opponent 5 always typed 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.860
 dissatisfied with his win and yes 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.030
 somehow a goal has been made, I believe 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.000
 you just got off the ball 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.840
 thrown away new also resulted 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.130
 not to be seen 22 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.599
 the whole house felt rather gone 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.069
 like a defeat and we 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.110
 analyze something now because of that 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.430
 Goalkeeper did exactly wrong so 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.319
 Let's have a look at the dead man 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.530
 nothing to complain about and what 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.669
 happens now 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.009
 he has a feeble attack apparently 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.449
 has suddenly gone down so that 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.849
 the ball passes perfect when 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.199
 you will fix nothing today, we will do something like that 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.419
 I see myself asking myself more often 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.949
 which normal romp because then goes out 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.389
 and at a time shortly before closing out 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:31.370
 It was really perfect when it was thrown 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.300
 passing him but I believe that 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.729
 is quite normal if you have one 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.130
 Football game in Canada 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.810
 from Canada what about football? 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.539
 he will never do the next nhl 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.889
 from germany in any case but after 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:44.060
 sold a few players to the match and 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.130
 just wanted to go to my transferlist 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.330
 click and have seen there or is still 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.270
 a player with whom I killed before 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.190
 have salads with damn good values 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.250
 and you just pack my steam 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.750
 and let's see how it is but that 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.430
 we'll see it in the next episode 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.620
 that was the fifth episode of 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.820
 because of the 13 415 ultimate if it is 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.320
 you liked the video 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.520
 with a thumb up and evaluate 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.520
