00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
retained so what we basically do is look

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.649 
retained so what we basically do is look
at<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.339> bits<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.670> pieces<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
thousand in a kilowatt racecar obviously

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
thousand in a kilowatt racecar obviously
they're<00:01:10.320> different<00:01:10.350> requirements<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
can do that with the factory turbo you
just<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> better<00:01:23.969> intercooler<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.990> you're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
dragged this off the file that's one

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
dragged this off the file that's one
with<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> fairly<00:01:33.810> small<00:01:34.020> turbo<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.680> do

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
with a fairly small turbo that we do

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
with a fairly small turbo that we do
that's<00:01:34.979> making<00:01:35.310> five<00:01:35.490> hundred<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.880> twenty

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that's making five hundred and twenty

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
that's making five hundred and twenty
kilowatts<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> tires<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
kilowatts of the tires with it with a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
kilowatts of the tires with it with a
manual<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:38.880> Hayden's<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
manual same as what Hayden's got and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.139 
manual same as what Hayden's got and
that<00:01:39.840> makes<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.289> pretty<00:01:40.320> wild<00:01:40.680> ride<00:01:41.149> so

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
that makes for a pretty wild ride so

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.330 
that makes for a pretty wild ride so
basically<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:43.289> back<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.590> Hayden<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.130> say

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
basically I get back to Hayden and I say

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
basically I get back to Hayden and I say
