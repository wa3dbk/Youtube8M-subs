00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 on the one hand we know from 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.680
 the orthodox teaching of god was only 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.110
 there was another hand man coming in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.849
 this world he comes already pan 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.619
 damage mortality poverty glad 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:21.570
 every kind of sin is added to each 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.859
 he should not want to notice 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 should deal with it in my opinion as 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.119
 I understand getting the ball point 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.500
 human life 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.610
 everyday fight and everyday 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.640

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.649
 thanks anyway , we have 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 everyday struggle only unfortunately 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 not everyday feat daily on 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.110
 website and problems and when we speak in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 these everyday problems then we 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 It is considered as well, so she 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.660
 Naturally, how many of them does a person have 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.290
 life and how many problems we have to order 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.780
 family life oh my goodness how much 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 collectives in public life and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 how many problems we are asked now and the media 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.720
 this one television is only internet 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.180
 and so on, even there are many problems here. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 Christianity orients people to that 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.500
 not just the fact that these problems and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.700
 difficulties there were never you know 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.189
 it always was and is and will be a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.439
 to direct this work humanly these 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.299
 efforts on track and here it is needed 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 this mainstream says Christianity 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.540
 is to man 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 took care 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.909
 if he believes in christ if he believes 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.710
 that the commandments of God 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.399
 it is truly the most direct 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 and the true path of human life which 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.930
 brings 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.100
 and bring him the true good so 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.869
 there he believes in it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.590
 that he should undertake here 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.760
 small even the effort to ensure that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.280
 succumb 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.850
 all sorts of rubbish 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.740
 which arises in our soul as far as 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.740
 it may not be envious of what are you 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.470
 envy him well spit you on everything 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.709
 in the end take care of your health not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.870
 the eggs did not envy you all 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.700
 so on here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:39.680
 and even if it were not for this would be if 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.430
 man was not here now that fight's 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.459
 with this all whoever he was 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.780
 a lying corpse from a Christian point 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.950
 view of good and are just that 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.540
 mates with a certain effort 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.140
 I can't even win 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.069
 that unfortunately we usually happen 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.540
 god sees our effort know and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.470
 wonderful words about george the hermit 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.780
 you are so mobile 19th century wonderful 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.800
 his words are about such i-thought 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.310
 I will say for sure 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:29.180
 we are all like this yes we can not win either 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:32.530
 one passion but we have to do it not 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:38.090
 do and should do it because 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.930
 he himself god told us the kingdom of gods 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.660
 nudity 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.060
 and effortless 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.859
 perceive it get it be be 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.090
 perfect as your heavenly father 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.940
 absolutely have to be what is the matter 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.810
 so therefore yes yes of course I struggle 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.700
 but this is such a struggle, think only this 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.570
 the struggle for true happiness they are all those 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.310
 ephemeral we have a comparison with people with 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.130
 circumstances I do not know just what 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.669
 please your family and friends 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:21.229
 when we get almost nothing 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.060
 how important it is to believe to believe that the west 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.460
 christ's 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.840
 give us the benefit that it is a struggle for them 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.260
 gives us 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.720
 parts and then this is a cape this idea she 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.610
 inspires man and brings him 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.850
 really brings in the full sense 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.850
 words brings him this happiness
