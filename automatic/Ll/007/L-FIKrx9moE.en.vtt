00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.110 
thought it'd be a good variation that
way<00:03:26.040> i'm<00:03:26.160> using<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.520> two<00:03:26.670> tablespoons<00:03:27.120> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
way i'm using like two tablespoons of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.280 
way i'm using like two tablespoons of
syrup<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.690> you're<00:03:27.780> getting<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.080> flavor

syrup so you're getting the flavor

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.560
