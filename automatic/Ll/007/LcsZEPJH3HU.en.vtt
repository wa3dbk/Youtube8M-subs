00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.060
 Well I'm Mary Goode and today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 I bring you a video about a young man 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
 much that I do not make a hall so I said 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.840
 let's make a hall about things 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.680
 that I was buying more or less from 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 June until now that we are in August 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 so these things I bought them as 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 Throughout these months and for which 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 they ask and they always ask me if 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 these things to me they give me no no I 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.179
 they give them these things I buy them 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 with my own money mine and sometimes of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.540
 my parents and nothing at the time in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.790
 exile came to me 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 some day some gifts I 'm going to 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.950
 saying this they gave it to me but not everything 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.810
 what I'm going to show him I bought it 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.430
 with my own money I also do this 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.070
 game so you know how I always say 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.930
 If you like something I'm showing 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.760
 can go to buy stable and are from 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.739
 other countries and have these marks in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.500
 their countries can also go to 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.500
 buy let's start with two books 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330
 Surely you saw them in my video that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.370
 and about the books so here they 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.960
 I leave the link of that video as this is 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.600
 they did not see it about what I read of the month of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 January to August and I show these books 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 that one is three meters above the sky 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 by federico moccia 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 the choice of ghost or wonder as what 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.409
 know you this month there are 80 pesos and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.460
 this one came out 119 I love them 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.290
 I love them 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.940
 they are perfect now we go with the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.980
 purchases that I made in all fashion 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.540
 the first one buy two pairs of media 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.610
 because good I needed measures for 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.880
 this winter you are in comics and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.010
 These are gray with roses and I 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.170
 they left 29 each pair then I also 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.910
 I bought in all fashion a usb cable for the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.190
 iphone because as you know when we 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.190
 we buy the iphone nothing else comes 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.770
 a single cable 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 it can get to break very easy and I 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.600
 I have the same cable for the ipad 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.340
 also so 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.930
 I have to make sure I said do not know 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.159
 break and cable so at all times 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.380
 It will be a sale of cables for 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.869
 cell phones sold for iphone and for 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.820
 the samsung galaxy and I bought this 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.780
 very happy cable that has a little face 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.720
 happy 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.610
 and another happy face there and this cable 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.459
 he left 35 Argentine pesos 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 Finally in all fashion I bought with 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.070
 hats 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.850
 this hat was 120 pesos and I 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:29.840
 it ends up I think 90 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.840
 and it's with hat gray as of year 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 this the black 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.440
 Mariana is happy with her hat to the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.980
 harry styles a long time ago that tomorrow 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 bought clothes so she decided to start 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.129
 renovate your gift cabinet a little 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.730
 things that I did not use anymore even though they did not enter 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.260
 in preparation there are many clothes and I 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 I bought new clothes do not buy a lot of clothes 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.980
 but good first thing that I'm going to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.379
 show is this red coral rose abuse 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.880
 like I did not have a camera that is a little bus 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.080
 A) Yes 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.020
 three quarter sleeve type and have these 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.880
 appliques 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.920
 this use I think I got 130 pesos and 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.020
 that same day I also bought this use 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.570
 which is a warmer touch is blue and 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.650
 there is a girl who says mister and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.110
 I try 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.870
 amazing or as it is said is a blue taste 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.439
 that has black sleeves and they have their 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.860
 hood blue and this left me 250 pesos 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.780
 this is what I bought in a big place like that 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.720
 and no special mark then I 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.489
 I bought two shirts that are for those who 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.159
 they are argentine know that here we have the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.140
 calle avellaneda avenue that is in 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.959
 where they sell very cheap clothes the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.909
 they sell wholesale or retail but 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.690
 I hate and avellaneda truly to 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.850
 buy clothes 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.980
 because there are many people and I can not 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.590
 try and it bothers me so a friend will 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.330
 Call between clothes and I know you are going to buy 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.640
 avellaneda so if you like these 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.950
 you can now get there the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.550
 first is this white shirt that has 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.470
 as 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.760
 imitation leather around the neck and 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.400
 has three girls 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.519
 there 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.210
 and the second one I'm in love with is this 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.759
 chiffon shirt that says pink 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.350
 flamingos and what I like most about this 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.590
 T-shirt is the back 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.030
 and from each of these t-shirts it came out 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.710
 145 pesos but if they go to avellaneda 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.700
 sure they get cheaper 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.520
 and finally I went to the pharmacy and mariana 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.260
 he did something very important in his life he 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.600
 bought liquid base because I did not give 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.460
 more sugar then what Mariana did 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.650
 was purchased liquid base because its 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.280
 face with acne did not give for more and was 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.280
 too 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.060
 samuel this I said I do not like 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.100
 be liquid base 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.870
 I do not like to use more and liquidates up 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.180
 this moment I tried this base that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.850
 I loved it and I think 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.949
 all and liquid that I bought was the one from 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.020
 maybelline the worst makeup the base 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:16.509
 liquid anti mud spots anti spots 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.509
 maximum 10 percent salicylic acid 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.689
 according to what he says here is for as for 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:28.300
 anti-hail and all that natural finish and 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:30.189
 mate moisturizes your skin your skin looks express 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.990
 that told in a report the truth is that 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.730
 if it works very well for me 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.550
 first, obviously, I put the 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.500
 correctors provided you leave your ship 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.500
 cellular and then 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.310
 my correctors as always after I 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.800
 I apply this liquid base and also the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.650
 complemented with that I bought the base in 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.120
 powder from the same Maybelline line 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.069
 I remember the price of each one because 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.560
 I would buy more things and I bought things 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.110
 in a matame from the pharmacy 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.139
 but I think it was something of 85 pesos 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.200
 each thing or group the truth is that 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.300
 I do not know if it was luck or chance ok but 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.540
 I describe that this disappeared me 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.100
 acne completely and now you can 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.720
 hide well the stains that I have 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.430
 active about here months later also 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.570
 in the pharmacy that also helped 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:25.940
 I bought this neutrogena exfoliant 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.860
 youtube and china anti nails and comes 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.470
 black dots I think it 's in Portuguese 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.120
 or you also feel some grains help 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.000
 to combat and prevent blackheads 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.450
 with salicylic acid plus microspheres 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.250
 this I do it every night when I go to 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:45.410
 do my night routine that one day 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:47.600
 I will talk about the gargoyle this I feel the 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.639
 face very well and well here there are also 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.060
 helped in that d 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.219
 of the granites and also if not so much 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.029
 that so many points are not coming to me 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:02.270
 black on the nose as I came out before 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:04.400
 and this I think I got 80 pesos for 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.099
 last what I bought in farmacity was 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.620
 this balm extinguishes the chuvi balm 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:12.039
 in color 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.039
 brumby 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.930
 is a moisturizing lip balm 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.789
 nude color 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.480
 I like bright colors because 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:27.270
 I feel like it was like the joke show 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.460
 I loved this says it lasts 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.550
 approximately 4 hours and it may be that 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.080
 lasted 4 hours and came out 45 pesos but I do not know 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.080
 answer now in case it will have increased 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.660
 well those were all the purchases that 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.580
 I did during these months I hope that you 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.650
