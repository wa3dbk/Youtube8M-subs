to go with like the lightest color just

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
to go with like the lightest color just
because<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.010> didn't<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> purchase<00:00:47.370> some

they they're convinced that these are my
eyes<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> only<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> print

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
eyes because you can only see the print

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.639 
eyes because you can only see the print
when<00:01:45.299> you're<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.530> close<00:01:48.649> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
when you're like really up close and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.120 
when you're like really up close and
when<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.009> far<00:01:50.280> away<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.950> only

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
when you're far away you know the only

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.679 
when you're far away you know the only
downside<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.119> contacts<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
downside I have to these contacts is

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.800 
downside I have to these contacts is
that<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.320> their<00:01:56.219> annual<00:01:56.579> contacts<00:01:57.329> which<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that on their annual contacts which is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
that on their annual contacts which is
actually<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> good<00:01:58.290> thing<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:59.430> what<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> find<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
actually a good thing but what I find is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.789 
actually a good thing but what I find is
that<00:02:00.540> they're<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:00.960> compared<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that they're different compared to the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
that they're different compared to the
two-week<00:02:02.430> contacts<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> normally<00:02:03.479> use

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
two-week contacts that I normally use

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
two-week contacts that I normally use
which<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.380> they're<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.799> breathable

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
which is because they're more breathable

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
which is because they're more breathable
and<00:02:05.610> these<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.090> thicker<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:06.990> that's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.279 
and these are like thicker but that's
also<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.770> last<00:02:07.979> longer<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.720> um<00:02:09.720> yeah

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
also so they can last longer and um yeah

this website they wouldn't answer him he

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.379 
this website they wouldn't answer him he
basically<00:04:31.500> paid<00:04:32.009> for<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> same<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.240> week

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
basically paid for the same the one week

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.670 
basically paid for the same the one week
shipping<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:35.330> he<00:04:36.330> didn't<00:04:36.780> get<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> response<00:04:37.110> he

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
shipping and he didn't get a response he

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.129 
shipping and he didn't get a response he
didn't<00:04:37.830> get<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.949> response<00:04:38.159> for<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.669> while<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.570> so

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
didn't get a response for a while and so

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.719 
didn't get a response for a while and so
it's<00:04:40.380> like<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.590> month<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.009> half<00:04:41.039> passed<00:04:41.550> by

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
it's like a month and a half passed by

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.219 
it's like a month and a half passed by
then<00:04:42.000> finally<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.419> guess<00:04:42.720> they<00:04:42.870> had<00:04:43.020> written

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
then finally I guess they had written

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.170 
then finally I guess they had written
back<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:44.280> told<00:04:44.520> him<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.699> they<00:04:45.150> had

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
back and they told him that they had

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.040 
back and they told him that they had
messed<00:04:45.630> up<00:04:45.900> with<00:04:46.139> um<00:04:46.409> some<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:48.570> don't<00:04:48.990> know

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
messed up with um some I don't know

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.020 
messed up with um some I don't know
something<00:04:49.380> with<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.770> packaging<00:04:50.310> number<00:04:50.880> or

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
something with the packaging number or

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.360 
something with the packaging number or
something<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.509> don't<00:04:51.570> know<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.099> guess<00:04:53.099> it

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
something I don't know and I guess it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.620 
something I don't know and I guess it
didn't<00:04:54.030> go<00:04:54.060> through<00:04:54.330> um<00:04:55.580> so<00:04:56.580> then<00:04:56.789> they<00:04:57.270> sent

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
didn't go through um so then they sent

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.330 
didn't go through um so then they sent
it<00:04:57.780> back<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.380> now<00:04:58.590> they're<00:04:58.770> sending<00:04:58.949> it<00:04:59.190> back

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
it back and now they're sending it back

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.640 
it back and now they're sending it back
again<00:04:59.699> but<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.449> thing<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.659> my<00:05:00.930> brother<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.320> not

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
it's been like two months since my

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
mean they probably fixed it now because

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.920 
mean they probably fixed it now because
he<00:05:36.010> didn't<00:05:36.160> really<00:05:36.280> tell<00:05:36.490> me<00:05:36.640> like<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.660> whole

he didn't really tell me like the whole
details<00:05:38.230> to<00:05:38.650> it<00:05:38.800> but<00:05:39.130> all<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.280> know<00:05:39.430> is<00:05:39.730> that<00:05:39.940> he

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
details to it but all I know is that he

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.670 
details to it but all I know is that he
