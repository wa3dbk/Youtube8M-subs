review we're doing a review of the DC
Universe<00:00:18.340> Classics<00:00:19.140> reverse-flash<00:00:20.520> because

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
Universe Classics reverse-flash because

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.190 
Universe Classics reverse-flash because
somebody<00:00:21.940> requested<00:00:22.540> it<00:00:22.660> so<00:00:22.840> I<00:00:22.900> know<00:00:22.960> this

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
somebody requested it so I know this

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.960 
somebody requested it so I know this
one's<00:00:23.440> relatively<00:00:24.190> more<00:00:24.369> modern<00:00:24.790> I<00:00:24.940> think

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
one's relatively more modern I think

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.840 
one's relatively more modern I think
it's<00:00:25.330> even<00:00:25.600> more<00:00:25.630> new<00:00:26.050> than<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.220> red<00:00:27.610> flash

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
it's even more new than the red flash

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.390 
it's even more new than the red flash
but<00:00:28.210> somebody<00:00:28.720> wanted<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:29.770> that's<00:00:30.100> why<00:00:30.280> I'm

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
but somebody wanted it so that's why I'm

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.020 
but somebody wanted it so that's why I'm
doing<00:00:30.760> it

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.030 
doing it

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.750 
doing it
plus<00:00:31.720> it's<00:00:31.990> relevant<00:00:32.500> since<00:00:32.830> we've<00:00:33.489> been

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
plus it's relevant since we've been

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.640 
plus it's relevant since we've been
seeing<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.059> lot<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.450> reverse-flash<00:00:34.780> on<00:00:35.379> the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
seeing a lot of the reverse-flash on the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.890 
seeing a lot of the reverse-flash on the
new<00:00:35.770> TV<00:00:36.070> show<00:00:36.250> which<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.700> awesome<00:00:37.330> by<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:37.750> way

so let's take a look at the figure he

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.090 
so let's take a look at the figure he
stands<00:00:41.020> if<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.440> can<00:00:41.620> get<00:00:41.739> him<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:41.920> stand

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
almost died just there saying then he's

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.689

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
DC Universe Classics line of figures

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.189 
DC Universe Classics line of figures
pretty<00:00:59.680> standard<00:01:00.129> but<00:01:00.430> more<00:01:01.300> often<00:01:01.720> than<00:01:02.170> not

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
pretty standard but more often than not

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.719 
pretty standard but more often than not
at<00:01:02.650> least<00:01:02.739> from<00:01:02.979> what<00:01:03.100> I've<00:01:03.250> seen<00:01:03.280> he's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
at least from what I've seen he's

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.060 
at least from what I've seen he's
usually<00:01:04.150> drawn<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.839> little<00:01:05.199> bit<00:01:05.379> bigger<00:01:05.710> than

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
usually drawn a little bit bigger than

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.530 
usually drawn a little bit bigger than
the<00:01:06.310> flash<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.940> I<00:01:06.970> would<00:01:07.210> have<00:01:07.330> much<00:01:07.479> preferred

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
the flash so I would have much preferred

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.200 
the flash so I would have much preferred
he'd<00:01:08.170> be<00:01:08.320> built<00:01:08.590> on<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.040> larger<00:01:09.580> body<00:01:09.880> that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
he'd be built on the larger body that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.240 
he'd be built on the larger body that
would<00:01:10.299> have<00:01:10.390> been<00:01:10.510> much<00:01:10.690> better<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:12.130> that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
would have been much better but that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.590 
would have been much better but that
doesn't<00:01:12.549> really<00:01:12.640> take<00:01:12.909> anything<00:01:13.120> away<00:01:13.360> from

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
doesn't really take anything away from

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.149 
doesn't really take anything away from
the<00:01:13.690> figure<00:01:13.930> because<00:01:14.229> it's<00:01:14.380> pretty<00:01:14.680> darn<00:01:14.920> good

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
the figure because it's pretty darn good

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.230 
the figure because it's pretty darn good
he<00:01:15.700> comes<00:01:15.969> with<00:01:16.210> his<00:01:16.240> lightning<00:01:17.200> rod<00:01:17.680> of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
he comes with his lightning rod of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.429 
he comes with his lightning rod of
injustice<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.659> have<00:01:19.810> no<00:01:19.930> idea<00:01:20.200> what<00:01:20.320> this

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
injustice now I have no idea what this

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:20.880 
injustice now I have no idea what this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
technically it's a stick with lightning

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.580 
technically it's a stick with lightning

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
shading throughout all of the yellow it

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.569 
shading throughout all of the yellow it
really<00:01:37.600> makes<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> figure<00:01:38.229> stand<00:01:38.560> out<00:01:38.859> his

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
really makes the figure stand out his

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.240 
really makes the figure stand out his
chest<00:01:40.149> emblem<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.439> well<00:01:41.619> done<00:01:41.859> it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
nice and vibrant and then here's the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.859 
nice and vibrant and then here's the
only<00:01:44.679> problem<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:46.000> things<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.659> wrist

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
only problem is the things on the wrist

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.169 
only problem is the things on the wrist
the<00:01:47.109> Lightning<00:01:47.469> zigzags<00:01:47.920> not<00:01:48.729> lined<00:01:49.030> up

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
the Lightning zigzags not lined up

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.080 
the Lightning zigzags not lined up
properly<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.020> doesn't<00:01:50.200> look<00:01:50.409> great

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
properly so that doesn't look great

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.459 
properly so that doesn't look great
apparently<00:01:52.090> they<00:01:52.299> did<00:01:52.479> one<00:01:52.840> application<00:01:53.409> on

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
apparently they did one application on

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.980 
apparently they did one application on
the<00:01:53.560> top<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.070> one<00:01:54.249> on<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.460> bottom<00:01:54.990> or

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the top and then one on the bottom or

the top and then one on the bottom or
maybe<00:01:56.469> even<00:01:56.560> three<00:01:57.159> but<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:57.789> don't<00:01:57.969> line<00:01:58.090> up

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
maybe even three but they don't line up

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.169 
maybe even three but they don't line up
very<00:01:58.450> well<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:58.929> either<00:01:59.439> side<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.549> belt<00:02:00.789> it's

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
very well on either side the belt it's

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.810 
very well on either side the belt it's
not<00:02:01.420> as<00:02:01.630> bad<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.350> belt<00:02:02.530> lining<00:02:02.950> also<00:02:03.249> not

this figure would have been aces the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
perfect but it's not nearly as

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.980 
perfect but it's not nearly as

color<00:02:16.690> from<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> boots<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.470> looks<00:02:17.620> kind<00:02:17.890> of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
color from the boots so it looks kind of

perfectly<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.990> figure<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.650> these

guys get to look at the photos of him
posed<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.580> yellow<00:03:20.940> is

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
posed is that all of the yellow is

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870 
posed is that all of the yellow is
molded<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.680> color<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.220> he<00:03:23.640> looks

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
molded in the same color so he looks

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880 
molded in the same color so he looks
really<00:03:24.150> good<00:03:24.420> even<00:03:24.720> though<00:03:24.930> he's<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.290> one

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
really good even though he's just one

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.860 
really good even though he's just one
solid<00:03:26.280> color<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> most<00:03:26.940> part<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.690> yellow

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
solid color for the most part the yellow

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.150 
solid color for the most part the yellow
is<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.170> matched<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.680> then<00:03:28.769> they<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:28.980> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
is all matched and then they have that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.979 
is all matched and then they have that
shading<00:03:29.550> throughout<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.180> he<00:03:30.300> looks<00:03:30.510> really
