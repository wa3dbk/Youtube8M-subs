00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
ourselves a mob trophy case so this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
where I saw it however I thought that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.730 
where I saw it however I thought that
you<00:01:26.450> guys<00:01:26.600> might<00:01:26.810> be<00:01:26.870> interested<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.470> seeing

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
you guys might be interested in seeing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.920 
you guys might be interested in seeing
this<00:01:27.980> so<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.310> figured<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.180> would<00:01:29.420> bring<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.780> to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
this so I figured I would bring it to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.840 
this so I figured I would bring it to
you<00:01:30.080> now<00:01:30.620> an<00:01:30.860> important<00:01:31.250> thing<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.520> note<00:01:31.670> is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
you now an important thing to note is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.690 
you now an important thing to note is
that<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.120> do<00:01:32.390> actually<00:01:32.750> need<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.380> put<00:01:33.710> some

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
that you do actually need to put some

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.780 
that you do actually need to put some
kind<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.210> block<00:01:35.510> around<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.080> base<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.370> mob

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
kind of block around the base of the mob

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.150 
kind of block around the base of the mob
trophy<00:01:38.270> case<00:01:38.480> because<00:01:39.260> if<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.470> don't<00:01:39.710> mobs

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160
