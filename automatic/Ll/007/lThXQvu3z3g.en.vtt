hey day traders this is al Hill from
trading<00:00:03.240> some<00:00:03.510> calm<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.890> talk<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.130> you

trading some calm going to talk to you

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.639 
trading some calm going to talk to you
today<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> properly<00:00:06.359> draw<00:00:06.839> trend

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
today about how to properly draw trend

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.509 
today about how to properly draw trend
lines<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:10.219> historically<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.670> lot<00:00:11.849> of

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
lines so historically I think a lot of

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.689 
lines so historically I think a lot of
traders<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.830> technicians<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.430> draw<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
traders and technicians like to draw the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.660 
traders and technicians like to draw the
trend<00:00:18.029> lines<00:00:18.210> across<00:00:18.510> every<00:00:18.960> point<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.800> have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
trend lines across every point and have

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.900 
trend lines across every point and have
everything<00:00:20.970> line<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.359> perfectly

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
everything line up perfectly

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
everything line up perfectly
we<00:00:23.910> basically<00:00:24.150> love<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> look<00:00:25.289> at<00:00:25.439> an<00:00:25.980> old

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we basically love to look at an old

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
we basically love to look at an old
trading<00:00:26.789> technique<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> Richard

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
trading technique which is the Richard

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.479 
trading technique which is the Richard
Wyckoff<00:00:29.130> method<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.830> like<00:00:31.830> I've<00:00:32.070> called<00:00:32.399> for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Wyckoff method and like I've called for

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.959 
Wyckoff method and like I've called for
it's<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:33.239> calling<00:00:34.520> for<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> formation

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it's basically calling for the formation

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.049 
it's basically calling for the formation
or<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.540> creation<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:38.360> parallel<00:00:39.360> trend<00:00:39.930> lines

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
or the creation of parallel trend lines

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.990 
or the creation of parallel trend lines
that<00:00:42.170> encompass<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> price<00:00:43.800> action<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> not

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that encompass the price action and not

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
that encompass the price action and not
necessarily<00:00:45.539> looking<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.230> hit<00:00:46.980> every<00:00:47.520> single

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
necessarily looking to hit every single

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119 
necessarily looking to hit every single
point<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> chart<00:00:48.469> we're<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> show

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
point on the chart we're going to show

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.850 
point on the chart we're going to show
an<00:00:50.250> example<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.850> today<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
an example that today so go over and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.959 
an example that today so go over and
select<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.399> trend<00:00:54.270> line<00:00:54.770> tool<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:58.789> you<00:00:59.789> don't

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
select the trend line tool so you don't

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
select the trend line tool so you don't
really<00:01:00.149> focus<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.050> point<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.789> focus

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
really focus too much on point you focus

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.289 
really focus too much on point you focus
more<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.610> making<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> lines<00:01:06.090> are

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
more so on making sure the lines are

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
more so on making sure the lines are
parallel<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.960> each<00:01:07.110> other<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
parallel to each other so you want to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
parallel to each other so you want to
take<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.210> origination<00:01:09.659> points<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> want

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
take two origination points and you want

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.410 
take two origination points and you want
to<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.340> sure<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:11.670> parallel<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.299> each

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to make sure they're parallel to each

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
to make sure they're parallel to each
other<00:01:12.890> now<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.760> try<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
other now as you see here we try to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.800 
other now as you see here we try to
start<00:01:15.420> drawing<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:16.220> lines<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.939> these

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
start drawing these lines and these

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660 
start drawing these lines and these
wicks<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.680> anything<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.070> creates<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> lot<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
wicks or anything it creates a lot of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
wicks or anything it creates a lot of
confusion<00:01:21.049> so<00:01:22.049> again<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> Wycoff<00:01:22.740> method

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
confusion so again the Wycoff method

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
confusion so again the Wycoff method
which<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> avoid<00:01:24.840> joining<00:01:25.350> these

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
which is you want to avoid joining these

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.060 
which is you want to avoid joining these
combs<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:27.170> triangles<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.799> random

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
combs and triangles and all these random

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
combs and triangles and all these random
patterns<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> market<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.409> terms<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
patterns look at the market in terms of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.660 
patterns look at the market in terms of
just<00:01:31.979> very<00:01:32.340> basic<00:01:32.640> clear<00:01:33.630> levels<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.220> draw

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
just very basic clear levels so you draw

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.649 
just very basic clear levels so you draw
a<00:01:35.700> parallel<00:01:36.180> line<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.329> would<00:01:39.329> say<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a parallel line here I would say it's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.100 
a parallel line here I would say it's
somewhere<00:01:40.020> around<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:41.270> right<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.020> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
somewhere around there right so as you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.270 
somewhere around there right so as you
can<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> clear

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
can see now you just have a clear

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
can see now you just have a clear
channel<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.600> Richard<00:01:45.869> Wyckoff

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
channel that's what Richard Wyckoff

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
channel that's what Richard Wyckoff
believed<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> market<00:01:47.820> moves<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
believed in but the market moves in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.080 
believed in but the market moves in
channels<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.740> didn't<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
channels you really didn't look at the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
channels you really didn't look at the
market<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.600> terms<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.740> these

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
market in terms of you know these

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490 
market in terms of you know these
various<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.729> diamond<00:01:57.719> formations<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
various you know diamond formations and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
various you know diamond formations and
a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> stuff<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> technicians<00:01:59.759> get

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
a lot of the stuff that technicians get

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.990 
a lot of the stuff that technicians get
lost<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.920> look<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.790> key

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
lost in so as you look here the key

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.310 
lost in so as you look here the key
thing<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.479> note<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
thing to note is that as you're in the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.219 
thing to note is that as you're in the
channel<00:02:07.770> right<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.360> kind<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
channel right you can kind of see that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.830 
channel right you can kind of see that
the<00:02:11.099> stock

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the stock

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.210 
the stock
slowly<00:02:13.650> start<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.470> reduce<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.920> amount

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
slowly start to just reduce the amount

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.059 
slowly start to just reduce the amount
of<00:02:17.340> volatility<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:19.050> channel<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
of volatility in the channel so here you

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.250 
of volatility in the channel so here you
have<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> lot<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.670> swings<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.050> some

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have a lot of swings you have some

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.530 
have a lot of swings you have some
