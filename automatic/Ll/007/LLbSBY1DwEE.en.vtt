00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so what is iPad 2 what have we learned

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.360 
so what is iPad 2 what have we learned
what<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.610> improve<00:01:21.200> well<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.190> an

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
what can we improve well it is an

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.330 
what can we improve well it is an
all-new<00:01:24.120> design<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.620> not<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> tweaked

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
all-new design it is not a tweaked

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.790 
all-new design it is not a tweaked
design<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.800> marginal

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
design it's not got marginal

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.980 
design it's not got marginal
improvements<00:01:29.370> it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> completely<00:01:30.360> new

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
improvements it's a completely new

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.580 
improvements it's a completely new
design<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.180> first<00:01:33.180> thing<00:01:33.480> is<00:01:33.750> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
design and the first thing is it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.000 
design and the first thing is it's
dramatically<00:01:35.430> faster<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.290> graphics<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.860> this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
dramatically faster the graphics on this

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.320 
dramatically faster the graphics on this
thing<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.400> wonderful

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
thing are wonderful

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.040 
thing are wonderful
so<00:01:40.020> a5<00:01:40.620> is<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.120> really<00:01:42.120> quite<00:01:42.780> an<00:01:42.930> achievement

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
so a5 is a really quite an achievement

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.990 
so a5 is a really quite an achievement
and<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:44.010> going<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.220> give<00:01:44.370> us<00:01:44.400> something<00:01:44.850> that's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and is going to give us something that's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.390 
and is going to give us something that's
up<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.720> twice<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.290> fast<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.830> cpu<00:01:47.280> performance

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
up to twice as fast on cpu performance

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.110 
up to twice as fast on cpu performance
up<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.390> 9<00:01:48.660> times<00:01:49.020> faster<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.710> graphics<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
up to 9 times faster on graphics and the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.350 
up to 9 times faster on graphics and the
first<00:01:51.360> iPad<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.200> no<00:01:52.380> slouch<00:01:52.730> we've<00:01:53.730> built<00:01:54.060> in

and<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.880> comes<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.360> two<00:02:54.450> colors<00:02:55.040> black<00:02:56.040> and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and it comes in two colors black and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.590 
and it comes in two colors black and
white<00:02:56.459> we're<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.910> be<00:02:57.000> shipping<00:02:57.239> white

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
white we're going to be shipping white

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.199 
white we're going to be shipping white
from<00:02:57.959> day<00:02:58.230> one

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.509 

and<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.480> give<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.660> some<00:03:06.780> scale<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.340> what

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
and to give you some scale this is what

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.550 
and to give you some scale this is what
it<00:03:08.610> looks<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:08.879> again<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.260> pick

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
it looks like again you can just pick

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.770 
it looks like again you can just pick
this<00:03:10.709> thing<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.220> almost<00:03:11.370> floats<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.599> would

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
this thing up it almost floats you would

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500 
this thing up it almost floats you would
think<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.290> we<00:03:13.560> would<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.069> give<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.510> some

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
think that we would have to give up some

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.860 
think that we would have to give up some
of<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.750> iPads<00:03:16.260> legendary<00:03:17.099> battery<00:03:17.519> life<00:03:17.870> but

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
of the iPads legendary battery life but

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.280 
of the iPads legendary battery life but
our<00:03:19.110> engineering<00:03:19.950> team<00:03:20.220> found<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.879> way<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.390> we

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
our engineering team found a way and we

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.580 
our engineering team found a way and we
have<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.769> same<00:03:23.629> legendary<00:03:24.629> ten-hour<00:03:25.349> battery

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
have the same legendary ten-hour battery

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.270 
have the same legendary ten-hour battery
life<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:27.180> original<00:03:27.720> iPad<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:28.769> all<00:03:29.069> of

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
life as the original iPad with all of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
life as the original iPad with all of
this<00:03:29.370> extra<00:03:29.610> stuff<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.540> yet

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
dramatically thinner and again that's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.799 
dramatically thinner and again that's
over<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> month<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.290> standby
