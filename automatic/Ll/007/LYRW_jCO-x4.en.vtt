00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 so here I am going to introduce you the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.259
 brand new this semi-automatic rifle 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.299
 winchester 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.200
 we launched in 2006 called 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.650
 the super x3 so this rifle 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.240
 I would say completely new 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.769
 is characterized by the new line 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.259
 we wanted to give the product 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.730
 winchester so we worked 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.700
 with one of the largest design firms 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.680
 Belgian and we really have the desire to 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.050
 give a new image to winchester 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.840
 which is characterized by a new one 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.340
 look can be noticed especially with 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610
 this red line which will now be 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.900
 affixed to all winchester products 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.710
 and that will be a little bit of the mark of 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.110
 manufactures our winchester range so 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.010
 here we have a semi-automatic rifle 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.160
 so read equipped so with a system 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.859
 behind gas mom so this is a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.690
 active gas piston goes the system so 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.250
 that they have the same pistons as we 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.500
 use for browning products and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.300
 winchester so we experienced 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 there there is a good number of years and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.739
 which is very reliable so this rifle well 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.899
 sure been proven high steel ball 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 performance so we can shoot all 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.680
 types of steel mines and that does with 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.110
 invectives in khater shows 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.979
 changeable a cannon on alizÃ© ferry board 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 is the peculiarity of this rifle 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.759
 so it's having a color of a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 any new carcass color is 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.860
 also the color of the barrel that is 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.619
 exactly the same as the one that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.720
 of the carcass so we have a finish 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.229
 gray and who posed one now has a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.670
 lacquer on the barrel that allowed us 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.560
 to have better resistance so 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.409
 to adverse conditions have made 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.200
 different tests compared to 7 7 lakes 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.940
 and this coating is much more 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.850
 therefore resistant to the conditions his line 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:53.259
 especially as compared to 1 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.990
 so to verdun by directing a tan 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.310
 classic forgiveness balance so so that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 it is this level finish 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 then we see that the design has been 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.380
 really studied for 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.080
 redesigned to really look 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.200
 very 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.170
 very very beautiful and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.440
 to this weapon there that is on the market 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.019
 so around 975 euros price 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.500
 public so what remains a price all to 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.620
 makes it affordable for this rifle range 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.620
