these other units we've installed angled
shelves<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.920> them<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.850> actually

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
shelves on them so that it actually

onto<00:00:41.820> their<00:00:41.940> own<00:00:42.030> feet<00:00:42.269> so<00:00:43.080> then<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.379> learn<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
onto their own feet so then they learn a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.700 
onto their own feet so then they learn a
lesson<00:00:43.769> not<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> urinate<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> phone

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.139 

we<00:00:50.710> get<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:51.010> phone<00:00:51.190> -<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.700> first<00:00:51.910> thing<00:00:52.030> we

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
we get to a phone - the first thing we
