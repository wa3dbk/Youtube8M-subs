00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.860
 hello passion friends mobile and power 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 fight today in our segment of 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.340
 applications we have an editor 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 photographic that will serve us for 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.419
 create shapes with our photographs and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.860
 it's called shape that first thing 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.600
 we have to do is load the 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.030
 photography that we want to edit and what 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 we can do from a photo from the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.010
 camera or even from facebook we are going to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 upload a photo that I have previously taken 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.540
 and once you upload the photograph it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.760
 open this interface as you see above 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.710
 we have the different ways that we can 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 create with our photo we are going to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 select first the normal and below 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 we have more buttons that allow us 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 perform more actions for example this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 from here the corner allows us 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.170
 reverse the way we are creating 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.119
 let's leave the normal circle and it 's w 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 which is on the other side will serve us 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 to remove the watermark but it's going 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
 to cost 15 pesos in case you do not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.399
 you want to buy there is no problem 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 now we go with the buttons below the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.090
 first of them will serve us for 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 resize the circle that we are 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.340
 creating for example if we want one more 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.750
 small or one bigger or the second of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 they help us to change the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.170
 transparent 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.330
 of the fund that we are creating by itself 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.210
 we want to simply highlight an area 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.160
 while showing the others the third 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.230
 button helps us to change the forms 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.790
 that are showing up here with 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.830
 he selected the category by 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 example we can also select 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.300
 symbols and now we can create clouds 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.780
 stars moons in short enough 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.330
 symbols that you can use for free 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.670
 there are more categories also like words 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.150
 or letters and some that are blocked 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 let's select for example letters and 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.170
 as you can see here we can have some 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.080
 numbers and some capital letters and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.680
 also a few symbols we are going to 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.590
 finally select some symbol 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.010
 for example 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.090
 this camera symbol very well 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.190
 finally the last button is going to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.200
 serve to select the color of the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.540
 layer that we are putting new by 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.459
 example if we put this red let's see 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 that it changes everything red and you can also 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.959
 manipulate the opacity again to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.150
 make it more transparent or less 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.030
 transparent we are going to select a 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.680
 black color and there we have it now 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.470
 when you want to share it, you press 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 up to where it says to be once 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 you press it will tell you if you want it in 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.620
 facebook twitter instagram or simply 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.720
 if you want to save it as a file, let's go 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.819
 to put what we want to share in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.769
 instagram for example and automatically 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.630
 instagram opens and as you see there is the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.060
 watermark that is not for nothing 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.860
 annoying simply says ceip that and a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.569
 Once you want to share it, proceed 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.150
 to do it as you see is an application 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.709
