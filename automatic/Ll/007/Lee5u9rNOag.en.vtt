00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
first guy who could create a device with

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.900 
first guy who could create a device with
operating<00:03:27.570> system<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.580> a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
operating system so that it would be a

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.840 
operating system so that it would be a
platform<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.530> know<00:03:31.680> every<00:03:32.130> applications

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
you also know Bill Gates and in Marvel

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.940 
you also know Bill Gates and in Marvel
very<00:03:38.910> much<00:03:39.090> both<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.750> them<00:03:39.930> are<00:03:40.140> my<00:03:40.290> heroes<00:03:40.680> now

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
very much both of them are my heroes now

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.970 
very much both of them are my heroes now
why<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.340> think<00:03:41.459> Bill<00:03:41.760> Gates<00:03:41.790> missed<00:03:42.980> so

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
why do you think Bill Gates missed so

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.300 
why do you think Bill Gates missed so
much<00:03:44.190> well<00:03:45.090> he<00:03:45.630> had<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> such<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> fantastic

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
much well he had a such a fantastic

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.000 
much well he had a such a fantastic
success<00:03:47.850> with<00:03:48.530> with<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> operating<00:03:49.890> system

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
success with with the operating system

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.009 
success with with the operating system
it<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:50.550> operating<00:03:51.030> system<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.600> PC<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:52.140> and

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
it was operating system for PC right and

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.009 
it was operating system for PC right and
when<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.290> are<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.890> successful<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:57.480> one<00:03:57.720> thing

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
when you are so successful in one thing

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.449 
when you are so successful in one thing
you<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:59.010> something<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.700> protect<00:04:00.320> yeah<00:04:01.459> right

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
you have something to protect yeah right

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.979 
you have something to protect yeah right
so<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:03.540> difficult<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.320> cannibalize

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
so it's very difficult to cannibalize

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.890 
so it's very difficult to cannibalize
and<00:04:06.989> he<00:04:07.769> was<00:04:07.950> retiring<00:04:08.550> from<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.030> company<00:04:09.630> he

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
someone once said to me about Steve that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.020 
someone once said to me about Steve that
unlike<00:04:21.750> others<00:04:22.200> he<00:04:22.860> saw<00:04:23.160> everything<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.910> a

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
unlike others he saw everything with a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.439 
unlike others he saw everything with a
beginner's<00:04:24.690> eye<00:04:25.070> he<00:04:26.070> saw<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.460> with<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.640> fresh

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
beginner's eye he saw it with a fresh

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.790 
beginner's eye he saw it with a fresh
so<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.080> he<00:04:28.199> would<00:04:28.350> start<00:04:28.590> from<00:04:28.680> the

so that he would start from the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.140 
so that he would start from the
