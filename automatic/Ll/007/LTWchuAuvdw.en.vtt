00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
outfit the thing I don't like is our
headband<00:01:51.079> because<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
headband because it's not really

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.109 
headband because it's not really
flexible<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
flexible and when you put it on it

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.069 
flexible and when you put it on it
leaves<00:01:57.409> markings<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:59.130> like<00:02:00.119> beside<00:02:00.659> her<00:02:00.780> ears

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
leaves markings on like beside her ears

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.319 
leaves markings on like beside her ears
and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> looks<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and I don't like the way it looks if you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.069 
and I don't like the way it looks if you
put<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:04.100> not<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.090> signer<00:02:06.329> ears<00:02:06.659> because

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
put it like not the signer ears because

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.190 
put it like not the signer ears because
it<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.409> looks<00:02:07.940> really<00:02:08.940> weird

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it just looks really weird

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
it just looks really weird
so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.950> wish<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.340> headband<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.940> more

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
so I really wish this headband was more

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.370 
so I really wish this headband was more
flexible<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> real<00:02:13.920> headband<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.550> be

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
flexible like a real headband would be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.140 
flexible like a real headband would be
but<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.610> flexible<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.270> all

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
but it's kind of not flexible at all

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.120 
but it's kind of not flexible at all
this<00:02:21.150> water<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.890> plain<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:25.130> but

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
this water is plain and I like that but

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.350 
this water is plain and I like that but
it<00:02:26.280> doesn't<00:02:26.490> really<00:02:26.850> match<00:02:27.330> her<00:02:27.959> dress<00:02:28.170> at<00:02:28.650> all

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
it doesn't really match her dress at all

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.290 
it doesn't really match her dress at all
it's<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.020> random<00:02:31.280> sweater<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.460 

guess<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:38.550> cute<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.690> dog<00:02:42.870> tags<00:02:43.170> are

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
guess but it's cute and the dog tags are

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
guess but it's cute and the dog tags are
plastic<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:49.310> really<00:02:50.310> wish<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:51.090> were

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
plastic and I really wish that they were

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.810 
plastic and I really wish that they were
some<00:02:51.720> kind<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.019> other<00:02:52.459> material<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
some kind of other material and this is

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.810
