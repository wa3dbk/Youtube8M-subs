00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.740
 Y 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.970
 all right 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 Hello everyone and welcome to illustrious 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.640
 ignorant I do this little clarification 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.410
 because we are in channel + and taking 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.150
 account our bodies and cloudy is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 possible that someone connect so 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.680
 surprise and you think that this is the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.210
 porn movie 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.500
 not for now we'll see how it ends 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.150
 What we do is to surround ourselves 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.190
 do this talk show with 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.200
 very interesting people like 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.200
 example the great actress vicenta n'dongo 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 to the left one of the few Galicians 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 with glasses that are in the world 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 and not only with that we settle 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.060
 but it is also comical the great manuel 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 burque hello 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
 and like all the ends the crankshaft 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.760
 is that they make this program work 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.360
 the great pepe colubÃ­ and javier is 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 assembly 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.579
 I will not explain the system of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.259
 program because after five years 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.840
 my mother there were children who had not 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.240
 born to five years because you already know how 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.219
 let's see a little video and then 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.219
 we talk about the content of it 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.120
 no no 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.460
 but no 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.120
 it is disturbing not carmen 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.900
 is this movie changed my life and I do not 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.690
 joke 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.240
 and then the white came and well let's go 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.220
 night talking about it that night 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.170
 moment of the qe2 of the day that is of the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.360
 night 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.460
 for that it is given another name 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.740
 and what do you know what I'm talking about? 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.900
 to talk about the night in its spectrum more 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.510
 big wanted to ask the acquaintances the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310
 best night of your life or the worst 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.440
 miguel king made a program 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 the night of that year because what night 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.410
 of that life what was yours 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.510
 Javi 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.980
 but let's see the place the night by 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 certain miguel rivers that hopefully see some 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.460
 day of this program I also tell you 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:21.200
 I leave it there 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:24.569
 and again in no time of the night 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.159
 in general the night is overrated 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.680
 I think it's a bit like the food 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.680
 like sushi sashimi like 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.090
 the sushi 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.090
 eat a sushi 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.140
 in the night itself is nothing is something 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.940
 that seems like it's something that people 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.940
 think that because you are at night you have fun 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.810
 if there is no light 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.350
 and there were the dancers 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.750
 we can have fun then people 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.700
 gets bored just like the day because the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.580
 night is nothing you have to contribute the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.440
 two in making sense of the night has been 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.120
 very istanbul or he had known a lot of 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.030
 much much much night I went out 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.610
 very much I have done 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.440
 they serve as a tune to my life and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.440
 it left when the iron age 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.740
 when we caught a newspaper it was already 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.740
 based on lilies and us 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.669
 and it has been very very well known a lot 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.650
 many students and we went out was 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.020
 night owl really be early morning and 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.330
 then later I lived at night but my life 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.590
 my best night was the day a floor day 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.380
 of students before the mann for bonuses 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.150
 of march such would be 11 11 and a half and 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.090
 I said for me, and if instead of going 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.090
 the march I stay here to sleep 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.160
 be lived was she was from that 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.429
 moment until here has been a happiness 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.449
 total already when I'm sleepy to sleep 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:18.869
 best night was the day I decided 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:25.349
 stay home to sleep and that's my 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:27.839
 answer bland but sincere I can not you 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.580
 recriminate nothing you vicente no I am 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.649
 according to what he says because of course 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.749
 they are overrated and more the 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.729
 nights but of course when I discover the 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.069
 I said good night, it's not so 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.379
 overrated or suddenly I found 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.300
 as a place a space because people 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.459
 It goes out at night and everyone 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.779
 it's the gin tonics and such but to me that's not 

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:49.319
 I was interested at all 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:52.619
 never alcohol or drugs is not no 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.870
 I did not find something very special and it was 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.390
 the dance 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.970
 for me that seeing people who do not dance 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.360
 never if it is not night only at night 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.340
 will dance drugged 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.340
 just like this kind of people is required
