where<00:01:22.900> kids<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.290> actually<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.490> would<00:01:24.640> do

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
where kids have actually like I would do

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.130 
where kids have actually like I would do
if<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:25.000> was<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.150> boy<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.390> mean<00:01:25.630> stick<00:01:25.840> your<00:01:25.960> hand

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
if I was a boy I mean stick your hand

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.050 
if I was a boy I mean stick your hand
down<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.320> knoll<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.950> they<00:01:27.340> go<00:01:27.460> for<00:01:27.640> his<00:01:27.729> bidam's

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
down a knoll and they go for his bidam's

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.149 
down a knoll and they go for his bidam's
so<00:01:28.360> it's<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.930> serious<00:01:29.170> situation<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.950> it's

so it's a serious situation and it's

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.359 
so it's a serious situation and it's
there's<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.819> possibility<00:01:31.749> of<00:01:32.280> transmitting<00:01:33.280> of

diseases they trapped they they've had a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.889 
diseases they trapped they they've had a
thing<00:01:36.429> where<00:01:36.579> they<00:01:36.789> put<00:01:36.819> they<00:01:37.569> cut<00:01:37.780> the

poisoning them they've tried nothing

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.819 
poisoning them they've tried nothing
it's<00:01:44.859> more<00:01:45.130> harmful<00:01:45.460> for<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:46.450> workers<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
it's more harmful for the workers the
