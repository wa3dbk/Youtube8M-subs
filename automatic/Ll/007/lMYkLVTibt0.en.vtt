 well then here we are with a video 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.040
 tutorial the first as sanz and in the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 video of what was going to be the new 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.570
 channel proposals 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.200
 we are going to show this first video 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.869
 tutorial is going to be on how to kick a 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.870
 good criminal of passage we will be able to 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.340
 everything has 90 in penalties makes him 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.920
 promotion to the run way here we go to 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 create 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 and then with the rome 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.859
 and well let's start with this 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.900
 tutorial then I will try to do 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.360
 this easy and understandable video for 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.930
 so they can use it and serve it 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.930
 my advice 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.770
 well I play with command but games in 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.810
 pc so 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 ok the xbox ps3 buttons I do not have it 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.640
 assimilated so I'm going to teach what 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 I know the eve that I think is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 use with the xbox buttons here to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.340
 command we put a look 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.750
 you look good because once you 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 charge the power can address 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.030
 where he wants the criminal to go 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.290
 it's very good always clearly playing 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.290
 with a 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.240
 whatever it is because he's going to see it 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.850
 when only you can serve well that 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.310
 with the eve after the main rival 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 to kick the penalty are you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.200
 depends the stick for me there is the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.300
 key of the ball but you have to have 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 careful not to give much force to the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.750
 left team that with exceeding the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 address 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.820
 just just choosing towards the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.370
 stick has to go the ball for me 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.260
 well there I am pressing you with 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.630
 strength for one side to show them 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.030
 I was going again 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.280
 again the player will always fail 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.380
 if you stability with him 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.569
 with power to one side of the shoulder 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.610
 move very strong will always grab the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.130
 criminal always 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.800
 pointing toward the direction that is 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.930
 good 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.930
 from now it is obvious that we have a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.130
 with a needle where we have to leave it 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 in the green part where better it will leave 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.069
 executed the criminal 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.890
 after 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.909
 we have good with here as explain and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.470
 good when choosing a stick is 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.500
 true or there is not one 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.270
 a logic they have to kick and see for 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.090
 any strong towards the goalkeeper with 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.140
 three claw more or less to the right straight 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.170
 perfect 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.209
 but the power is something that I was missing 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.150
 to reflect on players for example and 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.770
 that out there is not so relevant the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.690
 ball is not going to go that high can 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.390
 Charge up to the power limit 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 almost that the ball is not going to lift 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.440
 so much 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.740
 Here I am testing that without moving any 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 address 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.720
 the crossbar hit the crossbar did not happen 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 very high and discharge nearly all 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.130
 bars 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.700
 but I still recommend two bars two 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.700
 bars and media 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.680
 well the later with a stick to the other is 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.090
 easy afterwards if they want to hit you from 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.090
 Inner edge in penal 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.270
 with the e1 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.280
 close 1 l1 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.770
 they have to choose the stick and see how 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.050
 opens the foot the player to kick good 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.220
 there because it is very strong the stick has 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.680
 to be careful with that this is the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.510
 key the good stick after for r2 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.450
 good biting the ball 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.980
 A teaspoon awaits the archer 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.200
 he brought but good is like that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.760
 how do you execute this type of criminal that 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.870
 if you do 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.800
 it's an ice field behind 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.420
 the afternoon argues 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.820
 well nothing I think these are the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.820
 keys to kick a penalty 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.780
 with power I will give you a piece of advice 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.120
 this criminal is usually effective 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.639
 they have to charge when I'm on the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.950
 green line there and three bars 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:37.080
 more or less three and a half bars a criminal 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.080
 powerful to the most powerful medium 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.140
 that would come to be all the tips 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.180
 that could give you anything, get lucky 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.740
 the time of because the truth the penal 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.740
 they are luck and more than anything 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.560
 Well, I ask your forgiveness 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.060
 I'm wrong on some buttons because I eat 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.409
 I told them I do not understand much about the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.139
 other commands by not having those consoles 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.459
 correct anything and nothing I hope 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.610
 that you like and have served some 

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:08.620
 advice if you have any doubt or something 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.139
 can comment write 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.330
 I hope you like the video thank you 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.860
 I'm going to give you some examples of 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.860
 penalties in matches
