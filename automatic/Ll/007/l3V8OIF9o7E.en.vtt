00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.139
 with this would be had green would cost 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.579
 how and then welcome to our 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.579
 chapter number 11 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.270
 yes 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.970
 when we do photography in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.390
 open places ie outdoors 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.150
 the best time to take pictures in the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.700
 tomorrow is seven in the morning until 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.309
 maximum nine in the morning and then in the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.900
 late from three thirty four almost 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.360
 until five and a half hours in which 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.920
 we have enough light to capture 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.770
 our image without needing 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.580
 additional lighting because they are these 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.110
 lights these hours the indicated burton 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.210
 this thanks because we do not have a light 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.210
 overhead is to say that if it is not 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.430
 we have an illumination from above 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.550
 it does not cause shadows and makes 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.320
 our lighting is a little bit more 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.540
 suitable for the environment and in more than 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.220
 everything makes our lighting a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.200
 little more pleasant always 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.020
 side lighting is much better than 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 a lighting overhead lighting 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.720
 overhead always tends to create shadows 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.820
 do more in dark circles 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.450
 the part of the neck is a light a 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.370
 bit nasty is really another 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.900
 of the important things to have in 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.570
 account that of perspective and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.210
 what to know in block 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.740
 we have to consider how to do 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.580
 that our photography looks more 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.070
 three-dimensional and look more with more 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.660
 distance between objects have more 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.180
 that a whole environment is in our 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.369
 photography and not only have a single 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.500
 term and we have no feeling 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.920
 away a feeling of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 Atmosphere we tend to know how to choose the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.780
 objects that we have that look in box 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.290
 the game points we want to draw 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.290
 and the perspective that we want humanity 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.780
 i 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.520
 Y 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.270
 Y 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.330
