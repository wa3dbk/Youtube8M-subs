00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.020 
use and then unscrew that then you've
got<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.570> spur<00:01:27.900> gear<00:01:28.259> off<00:01:29.810> inside<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.990> here

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
got your spur gear off inside of here

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.859 
got your spur gear off inside of here
you<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.900> let<00:01:34.140> me<00:01:34.170> turn<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> take

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
you here let me turn that I have to take

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.520 
you here let me turn that I have to take
that<00:01:36.869> screw<00:01:37.710> out<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.689> take

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that screw out and then right here take

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
that screw out and then right here take
that<00:01:40.560> screw<00:01:41.189> out<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:44.009> probably<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> good

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that screw out and it probably be a good
