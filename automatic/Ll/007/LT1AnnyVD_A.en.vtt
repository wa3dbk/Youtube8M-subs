00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
managed to jump off of the golf cart as

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.660 
managed to jump off of the golf cart as
all<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.040> us<00:01:53.130> were<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.549> down<00:01:54.590> luckily

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
all of us were going down luckily

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.270 
all of us were going down luckily
everyone<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:57.000> okay<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.049> tough<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
everyone was okay was really tough it's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.260 
everyone was okay was really tough it's
really<00:01:59.369> happy<00:01:59.759> because<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.030> didn't<00:02:00.180> all

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
really happy because they didn't all

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
really happy because they didn't all
blame<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.460> actually<00:02:02.460> Wilton<00:02:03.000> who's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
blame it on me and actually Wilton who's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
blame it on me and actually Wilton who's
not<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.540> our<00:02:03.659> team<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.590> super

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
not even on our team he was a super

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.789 
not even on our team he was a super
sport<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.820> he<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.420> took<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.619> road

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sport I think he really took some road

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.979 
sport I think he really took some road
to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> face<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> he's<00:02:09.149> been<00:02:09.360> riding<00:02:09.690> really

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to the face and he's been riding really

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
to the face and he's been riding really
well<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:11.220> we're<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.459> lucky<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.000> we

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
well so I think we're all lucky that we

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
well so I think we're all lucky that we
were<00:02:12.180> able<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> bounce

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
were able to bounce

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.920 
were able to bounce
back<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.540> just<00:02:14.720> shows

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
back and I think it really just shows

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.130 
back and I think it really just shows
that<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:16.310> really<00:02:16.580> are<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> strong<00:02:17.030> team<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.420> think

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
that we really are a strong team I think

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.710 
that we really are a strong team I think
we<00:02:18.260> freaked<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.770> Ralph<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.580> little<00:02:19.849> more<00:02:20.090> then

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we freaked out Ralph a little more then

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.979 
we freaked out Ralph a little more then
we<00:02:21.680> freaked<00:02:21.980> out<00:02:22.099> ourselves<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:23.090> luckily<00:02:23.750> it

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
we freaked out ourselves but luckily it

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.680 
we freaked out ourselves but luckily it
all<00:02:24.080> worked<00:02:24.319> out<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:25.730> powered<00:02:26.390> through<00:02:26.599> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
all worked out we powered through the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
all worked out we powered through the
week<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.610> same<00:02:28.790> thing<00:02:29.000> happened<00:02:29.030> last

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
week it's the same thing happened last

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.729 
week it's the same thing happened last
year<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:29.959> well<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.680> really

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
year as well and I think it's really

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.240

special<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.780> eight<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.080> us<00:02:33.349> together

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
special to have all eight of us together

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.670 
special to have all eight of us together
in<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.330> same<00:02:35.510> place<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.319> also<00:02:36.440> have<00:02:36.560> an

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680

Jacobs is doing really well individually
so<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.569> nice<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.959> have<00:02:42.080> all<00:02:42.410> nine<00:02:43.010> of

so I think it's nice to have all nine of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.580 
so I think it's nice to have all nine of
us<00:02:43.310> as<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.550> group<00:02:43.780> having<00:02:44.780> such<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.110> strong<00:02:45.350> horse

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
us as a group having such a strong horse

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.039 
us as a group having such a strong horse
show<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:45.950> far<00:02:46.160> well<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> few<00:02:47.030> states<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.569> make

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
show so far well a few states that make

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.630 
show so far well a few states that make
up<00:02:48.230> zone<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> her<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.739> think<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.190> always<00:02:49.459> been

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
up zone to her I think have always been

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.720 
up zone to her I think have always been
pretty<00:02:49.910> strong<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.450> show<00:02:50.569> jumping<00:02:51.730> everyone

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
pretty strong and show jumping everyone

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.460 
pretty strong and show jumping everyone
has<00:02:52.880> their<00:02:53.000> own<00:02:53.060> reasons<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.840> explanation

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
has their own reasons and explanation

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.190 
has their own reasons and explanation
for<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.130> i<00:02:55.370> think<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.330> at<00:02:56.630> least<00:02:57.019> for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
for that but i think that at least for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.289 
for that but i think that at least for
young<00:02:57.350> riders<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.769> big<00:02:58.430> part<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.790> goes<00:02:59.030> to

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
young riders a big part of that goes to

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.180 
young riders a big part of that goes to
Ralph<00:02:59.660> Cristo<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.260> Holly<00:03:00.410> Cristo<00:03:00.860> there<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
Ralph Cristo and Holly Cristo there the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
ralphs the chef and he really knows how

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.300

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
kind of competition we also all have

really strong trainers and support so I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.589 
really strong trainers and support so I
mean<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.340> takes<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.580> lot<00:03:13.730> more<00:03:13.760> than<00:03:14.090> good<00:03:14.390> rides

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
mean it takes a lot more than good rides

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.260 
mean it takes a lot more than good rides
and<00:03:14.900> good<00:03:15.019> horses
