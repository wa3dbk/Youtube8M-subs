it's<00:00:01.469> kind<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:01.860> hard<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.550> may<00:00:03.210> have<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.600> go<00:00:03.750> a

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
it's kind of hard I may have to go a

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.869 
it's kind of hard I may have to go a
little<00:00:03.899> further<00:00:04.200> down<00:00:04.620> with<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:05.160> value<00:00:05.640> than

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
little further down with my value than

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.470 
little further down with my value than
what<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.089> had<00:00:06.480> thought<00:00:07.069> because<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.519> don't<00:00:09.300> know

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
what I had thought because I don't know

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.089 
what I had thought because I don't know
that<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.139> looking<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.679> get<00:00:10.830> when<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
that this is looking to get when you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.870 
that this is looking to get when you
just<00:00:11.280> fade<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.820> white<00:00:12.030> away<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.740> I<00:00:13.820> want<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
just fade the white away and I want to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.960 
just fade the white away and I want to
be<00:00:14.969> able<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.740> keep<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.949> clean<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:17.820> going

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
be able to keep this clean so I'm going

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.509 
be able to keep this clean so I'm going
to<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.300> there<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.960> age<00:00:24.470> maybe

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
to come in there with my for age maybe

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.880 
to come in there with my for age maybe
re-establish<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:26.910> spaces<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.539> there

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
re-establish a couple spaces in there

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
re-establish a couple spaces in there
then<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.039> still<00:00:29.400> come<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.820> tap<00:00:30.119> out

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
then I can still come in and tap out

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
then I can still come in and tap out
look<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.380> thick<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:32.040> looks

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
look out see how thick that one looks

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.700 
look out see how thick that one looks
there<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.350> crossed

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
there it's more because it just crossed

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.639 
there it's more because it just crossed
over<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.370> still<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.630> maybe<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.020> bigger

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
over but still it was maybe a bigger

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.200 
over but still it was maybe a bigger
skid<00:00:38.370> mark<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> landed<00:00:39.719> my<00:00:40.940> eraser

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
this blade in front of it and and hop

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
this blade in front of it and and hop
over<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.369> trying<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.670> sure<00:01:50.820> I

down here and make a curl I come over

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.649 
down here and make a curl I come over
here<00:01:56.490> expecting<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> continuation

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
here expecting this to be a continuation

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
here expecting this to be a continuation
of<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.229> again<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.399> talked<00:01:59.670> about

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of it again just like I talked about

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.450 
of it again just like I talked about
earlier<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.409> things<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
earlier we want things to have a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
earlier we want things to have a
believable<00:02:03.439> what<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.829> send<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> off

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
believable what where we send it off

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.809 
believable what where we send it off
behind<00:02:05.909> something<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:07.350> wanted<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
behind something we wanted to we want to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
behind something we wanted to we want to
anticipate<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.390> coming<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> other<00:02:09.899> side

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
anticipate it coming out the other side

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.809 
anticipate it coming out the other side
in<00:02:10.560> many<00:02:10.920> cases<00:02:11.400> so

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
in many cases so

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.440 
in many cases so
and<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> direction<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.290> send<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.860> off

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and and the direction we send it off

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.300 
and and the direction we send it off
will<00:02:16.450> determine<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.049> lot<00:02:17.079> of<00:02:17.500> what<00:02:17.650> our<00:02:17.680> minds

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
will determine a lot of what our minds

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.360 
will determine a lot of what our minds
decide<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.590> areas<00:02:21.069> where<00:02:21.250> we

decide is going on in areas where we

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.690 
decide is going on in areas where we
can't<00:02:21.579> see<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
