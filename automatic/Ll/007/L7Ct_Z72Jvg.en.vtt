00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:02.350 

there's<00:01:53.719> really<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.289> little<00:01:54.380> complicated

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.130 

I'll<00:02:03.110> say<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.340> she<00:02:04.400> went<00:02:04.790> 3<00:02:05.540> up<00:02:05.690> already<00:02:06.050> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
I'll say it so she went 3 up already and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:16.000 
I'll say it so she went 3 up already and
walked<00:02:06.560> across<00:02:07.180> okay<00:02:08.180> good<00:02:11.140> -<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:14.590> was<00:02:15.590> pursuing

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
walked across okay good - I was pursuing

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.940 
walked across okay good - I was pursuing
more<00:02:16.160> over

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so I went down to I think they need

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.890 
so I went down to I think they need
about<00:02:24.440> three<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:26.330> then<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.400> go<00:02:28.489> to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
about three and then and then you go to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
about three and then and then you go to
up<00:02:29.900> looks<00:02:30.140> like<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:33.130> right<00:02:34.130> up<00:02:34.280> damage

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
up looks like one to right up damage

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.380 
up looks like one to right up damage
