inside of the tube you can actually

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
inside of the tube you can actually
install<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.970> without<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.689> put

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
install it without that you can just put

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
install it without that you can just put
a<00:01:40.280> bolt<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> washer<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> nut<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> just

a bolt and washer in a nut and just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.050 
a bolt and washer in a nut and just
crank<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.329> even<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:47.060> quick

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
crank it down like that or even a quick

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.080 
crank it down like that or even a quick

release and the hub from a bicycle wheel
can<00:01:54.090> work<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.570> although<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
can work as well although that's it's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
can work as well although that's it's
pretty<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.820> steel<00:01:57.390> driven<00:01:57.930> up

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
pretty hard to do with steel driven up

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410 
pretty hard to do with steel driven up
I've<00:01:58.229> done<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.579> aluminum<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.180> doesn't

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I've done it with aluminum it doesn't

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
I've done it with aluminum it doesn't
work<00:02:00.509> too<00:02:00.689> bad<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.259> steel<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.310> pretty

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
work too bad with steel it's it's pretty

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
work too bad with steel it's it's pretty
hard<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> we're<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.719> go<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
hard so we're going to have a go at that

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.820 
hard so we're going to have a go at that
take<00:02:08.129> our<00:02:08.250> time<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.259> we're<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> secure

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
take our time and we're going to secure

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.300 
take our time and we're going to secure
the<00:02:11.009> jig<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.150> hose<00:02:12.360> clamp

and<00:02:14.110> drill<00:02:15.110> our<00:02:15.200> holes<00:02:16.660> we've<00:02:17.660> got<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.080> jig

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and drill our holes we've got the jig

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.970 
and drill our holes we've got the jig
clamped<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.099> place<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.690> we're<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.709> going<00:02:21.800> to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
clamped in place and we're just going to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.120 
clamped in place and we're just going to
double<00:02:22.190> check<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:24.170> depth<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:24.770> make<00:02:24.950> sure

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
double check the depth here make sure

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.150 
double check the depth here make sure
that<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.880> don't<00:02:26.500> go<00:02:27.500> too<00:02:27.560> high<00:02:27.890> for<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
that we don't go too high for the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.559 
that we don't go too high for the
mechanism<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.709> there's<00:02:30.709> lots<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.790> despair

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569
