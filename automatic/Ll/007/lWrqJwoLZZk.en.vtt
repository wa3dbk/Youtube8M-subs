00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.760
 / beach 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 what is it going to happen for example? 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.809
 a friend Felix Borbolla and Juan Carlos 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.210
 medina come the two here you go to 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.830
 make a scene and let's play with 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.990
 these dramatic moments that there are for 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.539
 example in soap operas the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.220
 soap operas that is there are two actors and of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.830
 soon this sounds 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 when that sounds the two characters that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 have on stage have to look and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.360
 they have to justify why they have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.360
 past what happens so what do you 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.340
 and reporting we are at 250 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.879
 I will do the translation of what he said 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.200
 the pilot must also be a starter 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.860
 when the heirs of the magical 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.340
 Martha 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 bye 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 perhaps you know that both my co-pilot and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 we are in a moment without turbulence 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.350
 so I'm going to leave the pilot 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.310
 automatic 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.310
 to talk to you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.650
 with me so that with me I had not done 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.510
 Something bad is true, but more if you are 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.510
 the star purser 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.990
 what you mean by that star 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 I am luminous with that I am far away and 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.970
 distant 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.210
 It's been a long time since you've been away 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.340
 distant from me 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.340
 I want to ask you what is the reason 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 well they sent me to the part of up 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.409
 behind the plane 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 further back then if you are at home again 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.120
 I asked the airline 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.200
 please do not put me behind because 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.200
 I was close to the server 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.020
 to be alive has always been very 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.880
 dangerous for me marta 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.000
 I know that your alcoholism has caused it in 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.090
 our relationship 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.700
 you know perfectly well that I can not leave 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 my wife for you and that every time we 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 we found in this cabin 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.810
 because you left it open 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.810
 leave the cabin is west 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.030
 then clear that the honey or the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.030
 I came back from the bathroom all right 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.569
 how will everything be fine if the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.580
 copilot to the bathroom for half an hour 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.440
 this is unheard of really not what 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.799
 I can believe and also since so many 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.799
 buttons 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.360
 people make the buttons that domestic 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.060
 you commented this is all I said because 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.010
 I am a master penalty streak in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 distraction actually 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.560
 I had left the autopilot myself 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.550
 also damn but this pendejada 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.510

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.510
 behind the door 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.090
 while from which door of this 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.090
 behind the cabin channel 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.270
 these words are the things always 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.270
 being of me 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.400
 do not follow 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.400

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.920
