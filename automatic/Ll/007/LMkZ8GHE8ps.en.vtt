00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
launcher it goes faster who cares about

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.560

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
took a while to figure out that this is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.399 
took a while to figure out that this is
not<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:41.610> upgrade<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.659> many<00:00:42.809> weapons<00:00:43.050> in

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
not an upgrade as with many weapons in

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.189 
not an upgrade as with many weapons in
tf2<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> more<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> side<00:00:45.360> grade<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.839> that

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
tf2 this is more of a side grade if that

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.680 
tf2 this is more of a side grade if that
but<00:00:46.949> it's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.159> really<00:00:47.309> fun<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
but it's a really fun one to use when it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.140 
but it's a really fun one to use when it
all<00:00:48.900> comes<00:00:49.080> together<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> direct<00:00:50.909> hits

all comes together the direct hits

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.270 
all comes together the direct hits
Rockets<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.750> 80%<00:00:52.290> faster<00:00:52.530> than<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.040> stock

a good part to balance the weapon the

reduced radius doesn't apply to rocket
jumping<00:01:14.789> so<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.210> technique<00:01:15.659> doesn't<00:01:15.930> really

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
jumping so your technique doesn't really

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.889 
jumping so your technique doesn't really
need<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> change<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.689> weapon

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
need to change if you use this weapon

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.630 
need to change if you use this weapon
the<00:01:19.200> same<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.649> use<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> stock<00:01:20.369> launcher

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the same way you use the stock launcher

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
the same way you use the stock launcher
you're<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.420> end<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.719> missing<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> enemy<00:01:22.469> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you're gonna end up missing the enemy a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.319 
you're gonna end up missing the enemy a
lot<00:01:22.740> hell<00:01:23.399> you're<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> miss<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> lot

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.359 
lot hell you're going to miss a lot
anyway<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.469> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.649> pretend<00:01:26.039> you're<00:01:26.159> using

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
anyway but if you pretend you're using

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
anyway but if you pretend you're using
the<00:01:26.549> huntsmen<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.359> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:28.049> previous

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the huntsmen and you can see my previous

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
the huntsmen and you can see my previous
tutorial<00:01:28.950> video<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.609> bet<00:01:30.119> you'll

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
tutorial video on that I bet you'll

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
tutorial video on that I bet you'll
score<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:30.750> hits<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.859> mean

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
score more hits so what does that mean

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
score more hits so what does that mean
it<00:01:32.670> means<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.090> better<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.390> taking<00:01:33.689> shots

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it means you're better off taking shots

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.599 
it means you're better off taking shots
at<00:01:34.289> targets<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:35.009> moving<00:01:35.310> away<00:01:35.430> or

screen because there's less guessing you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.569 
screen because there's less guessing you
have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.780> about<00:01:40.020> their<00:01:40.200> position<00:01:40.619> closer

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
have to do about their position closer

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
have to do about their position closer
targets<00:01:42.179> are<00:01:42.390> easier<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.929> hit<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.649> that's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
targets are easier to hit but that's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
targets are easier to hit but that's
kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> obvious<00:01:44.429> isn't<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:44.939> also<00:01:45.479> targets

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kind of obvious isn't it also targets

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.450
