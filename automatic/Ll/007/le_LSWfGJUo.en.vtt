ago<00:00:08.250> we<00:00:08.490> tested<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.120> effects<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.599> bite<00:00:09.929> weight

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
ago we tested the effects of bite weight

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.680 
ago we tested the effects of bite weight
on<00:00:10.410> climbing<00:00:11.070> speeds<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.300> laboratory

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
on climbing speeds but in a laboratory

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.839 
on climbing speeds but in a laboratory
setting<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.380> while<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> undeniably<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
setting and while this is undeniably the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
setting and while this is undeniably the
most<00:00:15.179> accurate<00:00:15.389> way<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> test<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.260> there's<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
most accurate way to test it there's a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.410 
most accurate way to test it there's a
big<00:00:16.980> part<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> us<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.460> still<00:00:17.880> wants<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> see

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
big part of us that still wants to see

big part of us that still wants to see
what<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> effect<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.100> open<00:00:20.340> road<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
what the effect is on the open road and

going to do man I are going to need two

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.319 
going to do man I are going to need two
runs<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.800> climb<00:00:32.040> each<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.270> about

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
runs of this climb each now it's about

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.610 
runs of this climb each now it's about
eight<00:00:33.540> kilometers<00:00:33.960> long<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.170> average

eight kilometers long and average

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
eight kilometers long and average
gradient<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.520> 7%<00:00:36.360> hi<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
gradient I'm about 7% hi I'm going to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 
gradient I'm about 7% hi I'm going to
use<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.530> Garmin<00:00:37.890> back<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> power<00:00:38.309> meter<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
use my Garmin back to power meter to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
use my Garmin back to power meter to
ride<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> consistent<00:00:39.899> power<00:00:40.079> both<00:00:40.800> runs<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
ride a consistent power both runs and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.740 
ride a consistent power both runs and
then<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> second<00:00:42.450> run<00:00:42.540> with

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
then I'm going to do the second run with

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
then I'm going to do the second run with
two<00:00:42.989> kilograms<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> ballast<00:00:43.890> added<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> my

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
two kilograms of ballast added to my

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220 
two kilograms of ballast added to my
bike<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.480> compare<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> times

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
bike and then we can compare the times

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
bike and then we can compare the times
directly<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.879> exactly<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> same

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
directly I'm gonna do exactly the same

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
directly I'm gonna do exactly the same
but<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.989> power<00:00:49.260> meter<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.430> in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but my power meter is going to be in

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
but my power meter is going to be in
here

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
here

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
here
old<00:00:51.120> school<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.590> field<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
old school all on the field because I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
old school all on the field because I
think<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> perception<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.149> still<00:00:54.660> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
think the perception is still really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
think the perception is still really
valuable<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> very<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.219> important<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.120> new

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
valuable and very very important the new

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
valuable and very very important the new
you<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.840> calibrate<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.379> morning<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> took

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you you calibrate this morning it took

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
you you calibrate this morning it took
me<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.520> time<00:00:59.699> because<00:00:59.850> obviously<00:01:00.030> our

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
me a bit of time because obviously our

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
me a bit of time because obviously our
altitude<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:01.500> much

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
altitude but it's it's pretty much

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
altitude but it's it's pretty much
spot-on<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.340> ready<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.789> let's<00:01:03.210> do

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
spot-on and I'm ready to go let's do

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.630 
spot-on and I'm ready to go let's do
some<00:01:03.359> pedaling<00:01:06.470> my<00:01:07.470> bike<00:01:07.710> weighs<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.280> six

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
some pedaling my bike weighs in at six

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
some pedaling my bike weighs in at six
point<00:01:08.850> nine<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.390> eight<00:01:09.510> kilograms<00:01:09.840> without

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
point nine to eight kilograms without

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
point nine to eight kilograms without
weight<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> full<00:01:11.939> water<00:01:12.150> bottle

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
weight and then with a full water bottle

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.410 
weight and then with a full water bottle
seven<00:01:13.170> point<00:01:13.380> five<00:01:13.680> nine<00:01:13.740> five<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.970> finally

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
seven point five nine five then finally

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960 
seven point five nine five then finally
with<00:01:15.780> ballast<00:01:16.200> added<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.770> comes<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.520> nine

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
with ballast added it comes in at nine

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.359 
with ballast added it comes in at nine
point<00:01:18.270> five<00:01:18.570> zero<00:01:18.840> five<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
point five zero five so that's a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.280 
point five zero five so that's a
differential<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> around<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> kilograms

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
differential of around to kilograms

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
differential of around to kilograms
taken<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.100> account<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.700> full<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.119> bottle

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
taken into account the full water bottle

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.280 
taken into account the full water bottle
on<00:01:24.540> both<00:01:25.020> runs<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> round<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.930> ballast

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
on both runs so round one the ballast

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.760 
on both runs so round one the ballast

let's<00:01:29.400> give<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> nudge

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.570 

you're<00:01:47.330> trying<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.600> keep<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.810> nice<00:01:47.930> rhythm<00:01:48.580> keep

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
you're trying to keep a nice rhythm keep

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.730 
you're trying to keep a nice rhythm keep
my<00:01:49.730> breathing<00:01:50.120> controlled<00:01:50.620> which<00:01:51.620> is

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
my breathing controlled which is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.930 
my breathing controlled which is
actually<00:01:52.040> harder<00:01:52.280> than<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.460> think

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
actually harder than you think

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.690 
actually harder than you think
but<00:01:53.510> altitude<00:01:54.050> I<00:01:54.290> think<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> finally<00:01:55.460> got<00:01:55.610> I

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
but altitude I think I finally got I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.620 
but altitude I think I finally got I
found<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.030> good<00:01:56.150> level<00:01:56.560> which<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.860> sustain

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
found a good level which I can sustain

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.510 
found a good level which I can sustain
for<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.690> half<00:01:59.900> an<00:02:00.020> hour<00:02:00.110> effort<00:02:00.460> they<00:02:01.460> were

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
for the half an hour effort they were

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.999 
for the half an hour effort they were
there<00:02:01.730> about

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.759 

okay<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.489> run<00:02:08.729> light<00:02:09.539> bike<00:02:09.780> give<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
okay then first run light bike give it a

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:19.559 
okay then first run light bike give it a
go

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:32.930 

so<00:02:20.140> much<00:02:20.290> report<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:21.969> feels<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.269> normal

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.560 

well<00:02:33.620> round<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:34.800> done<00:02:35.150> that's<00:02:36.150> pretty<00:02:36.420> tough

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
well round one done that's pretty tough

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.000 
well round one done that's pretty tough
pays<00:02:36.930> quite<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.230> hard<00:02:37.440> climb<00:02:37.590> isn't<00:02:37.860> it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
pays quite a hard climb isn't it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.520 
pays quite a hard climb isn't it
especially<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.820> altitude<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.530> well

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
especially with the altitude but well

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.180 
especially with the altitude but well
let's<00:02:40.740> do<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.890> again

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
let's do it again

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.410 
let's do it again
indeed<00:02:41.490> what<00:02:41.640> he's<00:02:42.030> been<00:02:42.150> doing<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
indeed what he's been doing the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.480 
indeed what he's been doing the
comparisons<00:02:42.930> until<00:02:43.200> round<00:02:43.350> two<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:44.100> think

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
comparisons until round two but I think

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.970 
comparisons until round two but I think
might<00:02:44.610> either<00:02:44.700> quit<00:02:44.880> lie<00:02:45.030> down<00:02:45.770> my<00:02:46.770> bike

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
might either quit lie down my bike

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790 
might either quit lie down my bike

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.190 

feels<00:03:14.960> weird<00:03:15.400> gang<00:03:16.400> out<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:16.580> saddle<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.020> can

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
feels weird gang out a saddle you can

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.570 
feels weird gang out a saddle you can
feel<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.620> weight<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.070> bike<00:03:21.580> definitely

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
feel the weight on the bike definitely

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:36.440 
feel the weight on the bike definitely
notice<00:03:22.790> where<00:03:22.940> my<00:03:22.970> head

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.290 

so<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.690> sent<00:03:38.050> number<00:03:38.320> two<00:03:38.470> coming<00:03:38.830> up<00:03:39.300> let's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
so I sent number two coming up let's

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:50.640 
so I sent number two coming up let's
have<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.540> legs<00:03:40.720> hold<00:03:40.900> out<00:03:41.730> see<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.790> later

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.759 

I'm<00:03:51.310> trying<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.640> keep<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:51.940> same<00:03:52.150> effort

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
I'm trying to keep the same effort

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.140 
I'm trying to keep the same effort
perceived<00:03:53.769> effort<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.360> it's<00:03:55.390> difficult

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
perceived effort so it's difficult

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150 
perceived effort so it's difficult
breathing's<00:03:58.150> controlled<00:03:58.629> but<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.709> bike<00:03:59.890> does

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
breathing's controlled but the bike does

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.729 
breathing's controlled but the bike does
feel<00:04:00.629> just<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.690> little<00:04:01.870> bit<00:04:02.019> lighter<00:04:02.349> and

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
feel just that little bit lighter and

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.729 
feel just that little bit lighter and
more<00:04:03.519> slight<00:04:03.879> sprightly<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.530> steep

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
more slight sprightly on the steep

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.210 
more slight sprightly on the steep
sections<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.330> think<00:04:07.690> I'm<00:04:08.590> going<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.980> little

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
sections and I think I'm going a little

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.539 
sections and I think I'm going a little
bit<00:04:09.370> quicker<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:10.720> with<00:04:10.870> time<00:04:11.080> will<00:04:11.260> tell<00:04:14.549> okay

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
bit quicker but with time will tell okay

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.250 
bit quicker but with time will tell okay
can't<00:04:16.479> speak<00:04:16.720> now<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.459> results<00:04:22.030> are<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:23.020> but

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
can't speak now the results are in but

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.990 
can't speak now the results are in but
before<00:04:23.650> we<00:04:23.740> give<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.950> them<00:04:24.070> we<00:04:24.490> must<00:04:24.729> stress

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
before we give you them we must stress

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.120 
before we give you them we must stress
this<00:04:25.419> is<00:04:25.630> not<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> controlled<00:04:26.350> test<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.010> is

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
this is not a controlled test so this is

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.070 
this is not a controlled test so this is
purely<00:04:27.400> for<00:04:27.700> discussion<00:04:28.450> only<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.810> kind<00:04:28.990> of

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
purely for discussion only we kind of

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
purely for discussion only we kind of
kept<00:04:29.229> things<00:04:29.470> like<00:04:29.620> wind<00:04:29.860> or<00:04:30.160> anything<00:04:30.820> like

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
kept things like wind or anything like

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.450 
kept things like wind or anything like
that<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> nevertheless<00:04:32.889> very

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
that but it is nevertheless very

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.070 
that but it is nevertheless very
interesting<00:04:33.820> on<00:04:33.940> my<00:04:34.090> bike<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.660> was<00:04:34.870> riding

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
interesting on my bike so I was riding

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.750 
interesting on my bike so I was riding
to<00:04:35.380> an<00:04:35.620> average<00:04:35.979> power<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.280> three<00:04:36.460> hundred<00:04:36.580> and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
to an average power of three hundred and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.790 
to an average power of three hundred and
twenty<00:04:36.970> watts<00:04:37.090> on<00:04:37.360> both<00:04:37.600> runs<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.110> was<00:04:38.530> thirty

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
twenty watts on both runs I was thirty

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.280 
twenty watts on both runs I was thirty
five<00:04:39.130> seconds<00:04:39.669> slower<00:04:39.970> with<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.960> heavier

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
five seconds slower with the heavier

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.600 
five seconds slower with the heavier
bike<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:41.950> doesn't<00:04:42.070> actually<00:04:42.190> sound<00:04:42.490> like

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
bike so that doesn't actually sound like

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.070 
bike so that doesn't actually sound like
all<00:04:42.789> that<00:04:42.820> much<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.270> only<00:04:43.419> about<00:04:43.539> two

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
all that much it's only about two

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.050 
all that much it's only about two
percent<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.620> my<00:04:44.800> overall<00:04:45.039> time<00:04:45.400> but<00:04:45.729> Matt<00:04:45.970> on

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
percent of my overall time but Matt on

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
percent of my overall time but Matt on
the<00:04:46.120> other<00:04:46.210> hand<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.780> was<00:04:46.870> really

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
the other hand that was really

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.350 
the other hand that was really
interesting<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:48.010> was<00:04:48.190> well<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> went<00:04:48.820> on<00:04:49.240> the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
interesting it was well I went on the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.180 
interesting it was well I went on the
light<00:04:49.539> bike<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:50.050> went<00:04:50.380> one<00:04:50.650> minute<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.070> three

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
light bike I went one minute and three

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.400 
light bike I went one minute and three
quarters<00:04:51.760> quicker<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.139> was<00:04:53.229> for

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
quarters quicker but that was for

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.440 
quarters quicker but that was for
exactly<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.949> same<00:04:54.130> perceived<00:04:54.430> effort<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:54.970> in

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
exactly the same perceived effort so in

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.180 
exactly the same perceived effort so in
relation<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.289> was<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.800> pain<00:04:57.010> in<00:04:57.100> my

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
relation to that it was the pain in my

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.850 
relation to that it was the pain in my
legs<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.639> also<00:04:58.450> my<00:04:58.750> breathing<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.470> remained

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
legs and also my breathing that remained

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.129 
legs and also my breathing that remained
the<00:05:00.039> same<00:05:00.220> for<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.820> whole<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:01.270> each<00:05:01.510> ride<00:05:01.840> and

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
the same for the whole of each ride and

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.690 
the same for the whole of each ride and
where<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.470> noticed<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.039> difference<00:05:03.190> was<00:05:03.580> when

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
where I noticed the difference was when

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.550 
where I noticed the difference was when
the<00:05:03.820> road<00:05:04.000> pitched<00:05:04.330> up<00:05:04.510> above<00:05:04.780> seven<00:05:05.200> eight

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
the road pitched up above seven eight

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.409 
the road pitched up above seven eight
percent<00:05:05.740> gradient<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.729> bike<00:05:06.910> felt<00:05:07.150> far

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
percent gradient and the bike felt far

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.790 
percent gradient and the bike felt far
more<00:05:07.539> responsive<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.260> looking<00:05:08.620> he's<00:05:08.710> a

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
more responsive and looking he's a

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.440 
more responsive and looking he's a
bigger<00:05:09.010> gear<00:05:09.280> on<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.639> steeper<00:05:09.910> parts<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.270> think

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
bigger gear on the steeper parts I think

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.000 
bigger gear on the steeper parts I think
that's<00:05:10.599> where<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.840> made<00:05:11.080> at<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.289> time<00:05:11.500> well<00:05:11.889> an

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
that's where I made at the time well an

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.320 
that's where I made at the time well an
even<00:05:12.250> more<00:05:12.550> interesting<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.090> was<00:05:13.210> your

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
even more interesting was it was your

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.940 
even more interesting was it was your
second<00:05:13.720> run<00:05:13.900> when<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> were<00:05:14.590> on<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.710> lighter

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
second run when you were on the lighter

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.140 
second run when you were on the lighter
bike<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.490> one<00:05:15.789> would<00:05:15.880> have<00:05:15.970> thought<00:05:16.090> that

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
bike so you one would have thought that

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.520 
bike so you one would have thought that
you<00:05:16.300> had<00:05:16.419> a<00:05:16.450> bit<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.720> fatigue<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.169> old<00:05:17.349> legs

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
you had a bit of fatigue in the old legs

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.850 
you had a bit of fatigue in the old legs
there<00:05:17.740> so<00:05:18.430> conclusions<00:05:19.330> then<00:05:19.539> well<00:05:19.860> perhaps

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
there so conclusions then well perhaps

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.040 
there so conclusions then well perhaps
if<00:05:21.280> we're<00:05:21.610> after<00:05:21.729> pure<00:05:22.150> performance<00:05:22.510> clearly

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
if we're after pure performance clearly

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.350 
if we're after pure performance clearly
we<00:05:23.139> can<00:05:23.289> see<00:05:23.530> that<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.280> lighter<00:05:24.700> bike<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.180> going

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
we can see that a lighter bike is going

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.240 
we can see that a lighter bike is going
to<00:05:25.419> be<00:05:25.479> faster<00:05:26.020> on<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.200> climb<00:05:26.530> but<00:05:27.039> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
to be faster on a climb but the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.159 
to be faster on a climb but the
difference<00:05:27.700> isn't<00:05:28.150> necessarily<00:05:28.630> as<00:05:28.780> big<00:05:28.990> as

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
difference isn't necessarily as big as

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.990 
difference isn't necessarily as big as
you'd<00:05:29.289> think<00:05:29.320> but<00:05:29.770> when<00:05:30.010> it's<00:05:30.160> out<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.400> pure

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
you'd think but when it's out of pure

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.120 
you'd think but when it's out of pure
enjoyment<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.630> perceived<00:05:31.990> effort<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.800> made<00:05:33.099> a

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
enjoyment and perceived effort it made a

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.430 
enjoyment and perceived effort it made a
huge<00:05:33.460> difference<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:34.330> certainly<00:05:34.419> did<00:05:34.750> so

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
huge difference it certainly did so

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.800 
huge difference it certainly did so
maybe<00:05:36.280> there<00:05:36.729> it<00:05:36.849> is<00:05:36.970> a<00:05:37.150> lighter<00:05:37.419> bike<00:05:37.660> will

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
maybe there it is a lighter bike will

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.170 
maybe there it is a lighter bike will
make<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:37.990> go<00:05:38.110> faster<00:05:38.320> but<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.950> will<00:05:39.099> feel<00:05:39.400> even

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
make you go faster but it will feel even

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.010 
make you go faster but it will feel even
faster<00:05:40.510> than<00:05:40.599> that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
faster than that

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.870 
faster than that
so<00:05:41.470> that's<00:05:41.740> our<00:05:41.919> experience<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:42.669> we'd<00:05:42.789> be

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
so that's our experience but we'd be

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.550 
so that's our experience but we'd be
really<00:05:43.120> interested<00:05:43.240> to<00:05:43.570> know<00:05:43.750> what<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.380> guys

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
really interested to know what you guys

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.409 
really interested to know what you guys
think<00:05:44.860> have<00:05:45.190> for<00:05:45.520> example<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.030> recent<00:05:46.330> got

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
think have for example you recent got

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.210 
think have for example you recent got
yourself<00:05:46.660> a<00:05:46.810> lighter<00:05:47.169> bike<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.770> did<00:05:48.070> you

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
yourself a lighter bike and did you

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.740 
yourself a lighter bike and did you
notice<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.880> difference<00:05:49.210> let<00:05:49.419> us<00:05:49.510> know<00:05:49.630> in<00:05:49.720> the

a<00:05:55.720> lighter<00:05:55.900> bike<00:05:56.169> or<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.770> lighter<00:05:57.010> body<00:05:57.250> we<00:05:58.030> know

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
a lighter bike or a lighter body we know

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.730 
a lighter bike or a lighter body we know
really<00:05:58.419> though<00:05:58.659> that<00:05:59.110> your<00:05:59.229> legs<00:05:59.500> make

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
really though that your legs make

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.930 
really though that your legs make
probably<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.190> biggest<00:06:00.370> difference<00:06:00.550> of<00:06:00.820> all

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
probably the biggest difference of all

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.730 
probably the biggest difference of all
so<00:06:01.120> don't<00:06:01.330> let<00:06:01.539> your<00:06:01.630> training<00:06:02.020> check<00:06:02.500> out<00:06:02.650> the
