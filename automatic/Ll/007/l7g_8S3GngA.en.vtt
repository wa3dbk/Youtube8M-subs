00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.509 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:00:18.089> to<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.419> programs<00:00:18.689> we're<00:00:19.679> going<00:00:19.829> to<00:00:19.890> right

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
go to all programs we're going to right

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.029 
go to all programs we're going to right
click<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:20.970> PowerShell<00:00:21.839> and<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.739> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> say

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
click on PowerShell and I'm going to say

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.700 
click on PowerShell and I'm going to say
run<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.699> administrator<00:00:24.259> now<00:00:25.259> I<00:00:25.319> happen<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
run as an administrator now I happen to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.499 
run as an administrator now I happen to
turn<00:00:26.039> off<00:00:26.339> the<00:00:26.699> UAC<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.419> this<00:00:27.630> machine<00:00:27.839> so

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
turn off the UAC on this machine so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.849 
turn off the UAC on this machine so
normally<00:00:30.509> you'd<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.779> box<00:00:31.079> and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.499> would<00:00:31.649> say

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
normally you'd get box and I would say

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.250 
normally you'd get box and I would say
go<00:00:32.160> ahead<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.609> you<00:00:32.879> know<00:00:33.000> allow<00:00:33.449> this<00:00:33.719> program

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
go ahead and you know allow this program

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.770 
go ahead and you know allow this program

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
so first we're going to say get App X

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.950 
so first we're going to say get App X
package<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:47.089> we're<00:00:48.089> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.269> put<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.480> dash

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
packages on this system now one of the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.840 
packages on this system now one of the
problems<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.890> if<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.189> create<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.610> brand

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850

problems is that if we create a brand
new<00:02:07.939> user<00:02:08.239> all<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.259> these<00:02:09.410> apps<00:02:09.769> are<00:02:10.160> going<00:02:10.280> to

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
new user all of these apps are going to

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.040 
new user all of these apps are going to
get<00:02:10.519> reinstalled<00:02:11.239> they're<00:02:11.480> cold

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
get reinstalled they're cold

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.309 
get reinstalled they're cold
I<00:02:12.080> think<00:02:12.560> staged<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.120> we're<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.959> do<00:02:15.080> one

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
I think staged so we're going to do one

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.590 
I think staged so we're going to do one
other<00:02:15.470> thing<00:02:15.560> we're<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.310> say<00:02:16.489> get<00:02:16.850> App<00:02:17.840> X

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
other thing we're going to say get App X

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.979 
other thing we're going to say get App X
provisioned<00:02:20.600> package<00:02:21.790> -<00:02:22.790> online<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.989> we're
