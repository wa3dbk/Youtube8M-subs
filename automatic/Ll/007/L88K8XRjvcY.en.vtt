00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.510
 and here we are with the legend the great 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.580
 july champion césar chávez july 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 what do you think about the fight tomorrow with 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 canelo and mayweather 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.849
 it's a very difficult fight for the canelo 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.340
 we all know that the best is a great 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.220
 fighter a very deluded fighter a 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.820
 fighter who does not get hit and you 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.480
 is against hitting but we trust 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.180
 the youth in the desire especially in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.670
 the weight of the canelo that the fight now 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.010
 I think it will take you like 1520 pounds 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.890
 and maybe that can be the difference 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.840
 I do not know if we see a cinnamon attacking 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.600
 forcing the fight but if we see a 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.390
 canelo as a pilot with a drone I think 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.310
 that is not enough for anything like 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 do you think he has the strength to knock out 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.850
 mayweather and catch in here 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.220
 up the wind can happen to us 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.350
 remember that at the time of the fight 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.280
 the channel will take me to mayweather 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 at least 15 20 pounds then it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.370
 can make the difference 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.210
 if they fall, they would 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.000
 what kind of how do you say that big 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.120
 it's for mexico 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.910
 since they get into a great 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.550
 Mexican fighters possibly from 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.590
 all times not to beat floyd 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 mayweather is going to be the best fighter in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 Mexico 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.310
 he simply has to prove to beat him 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 mayweather 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.960
 accumulating of faith success of that because not 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.570
 the most beat to my web that's why it's going to be 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.909
 the best fighter in the world the last 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.439
 asks how is June is how is the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.920
 juniors camp and what we will see 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:52.179
 September 28 July is very well 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.820
 is preparing very well conscientiously 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.110
 eagerly that he is preparing 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 as if he were going to make his debut 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.869
 professional since he has a year without 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.840
 fight is eager to reappear 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.940
 I see a renewed July with new vigor and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.340
 I think September 28 is going to 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.750
 show that you are ready to dispute 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 the right thing 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.940
 the great champion Julio Cesar Chavez
