00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.549
 in the training camp on Lake Garda came to Munich for the first test match of the season 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.480
 2011 2012 with and against a selection of players from the region 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.959
 Trentino 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.149
 Hundreds are curious as the team coach Jupp Heynckes that 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.009
 previous training program had survived 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.330
 Who Heintges would set up was at least in the first half 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 almost the top 11 and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 Hagenow Bommels contract before treasures he opened against show already after 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 six minutes 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.120
 beautiful views of Toni Kroos about that is not an issue he started with 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.580
 left Wing 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.560
 beautiful preparatory work for 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.050
 gourmets 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.780
 He wanted to continue this season where last year had stopped and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 Did something at once 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.150
 the first 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.960
 and I can already anticipate the only good scoring chance ahead 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 Now enter for 18 minutes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.510
 Hannes Androsch 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.210
 Polit 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 fails, however, to Manuel new the otherwise largely 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.180
 Kleinert remained unemployed on demand and Trulli but no problems it 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.140
 leads newer 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.990
 otherwise 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.610
 Clearly one-way street football towards goal by coach Thilo 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.630
 after the ten minutes the 2 2 0 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.250
 a nice shot into the long corner of almost 4 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.430
 Schweinsteiger 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.180
 he played in the defensive midfield next to Anatoly Tymoshchuk and switches 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.170
 again and again 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.480
 forward into the storm 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.830
 in the next scene three minutes later 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.689
 again 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.179
 Ballhaus Schweinsteiger under the next goal that already better 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.179
 Template by Philipp Lahm the bayern captain 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.120
 and Schweinsteiger skin the ball to the bottom edge of the crossbar 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.840
 clearly 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.399
 in the first few minutes a class difference between these 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.929
 both teams should also continue the next goal already after 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.210
 20 minutes zone i 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 at 14 o'clock he played in central attacking midfield 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.310
 and showed a strong performance 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.920
 prepare the next goal again from Lahm over left and then carry yourself 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 Anatoly Timoshchuk 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.090
 Bayern Munich despite 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.439
 hard training 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.870
 So far, the better the superior team and 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.230
 often over left over so all were next work 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.980
 six and zero degrees so 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.649
 big with his second goal of the day six minutes before halftime 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.059
 the fund failed the big two now in the cinema selection 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:26.349
 but it was indeed and 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 of course a class difference between these two teams 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.389
 at the brick hut 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.959
 the next attack of Bayern Munich nicely over the Order and won 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.330
 Mario Gomez 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.979
 stays mostly 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.799
 and 12 in the 41 minute to 7 to zero that was also the halftime score 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:48.089
 then numerous changes in the Munich overall, they changed 8 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.469
 Players have become one of the few players left inside 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.099
 took two minutes after the restart, Elber came out colorful warned him 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.539
 also yourself 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:03.629
 8 to 0 the goals fell here yes we mature fruits three minutes later is in 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.919
 Sindh 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.460
 Luiz Gustavo already 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.069
 with Damon 9 to 0 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.879
 and again just a few minutes later the next good attack from Bayern 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.509
 Munich Arien Robben with the cross on Nils Petersen 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.639
 puts down the 1 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.239
 good six minutes for the first time 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.219
 Maas vague of seals 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.839
 the superiority of Bayern sat down now by the minute 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.469
 further ahead that much about Mier goals 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.399
 Leadership Biebelried with the 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.599
 before a free kick 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.409
 Tourists will both zero me with the pace 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.120
 only a few minutes later, the parents were already with the twelfth 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.890
 Drive round 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.149
 in the 80 minutes a great shot of the Croat 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.329
 Wittlich untenable 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.039
 it was not over yet 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.939
 from the cameras not for that they one of the already 1 0 of tens packs 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.169
 Youth player during taxes with the Bayern trained more overcoming 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.619
 the keeper in the second attempt 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.119
 and then it was time again for the Bebbi and Pedersen to sign up 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.720
 this flank 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.050
 Precisely and Nils Pedersen proves the weir in the second division per man should 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.400
 the goalkeeper saves and can hit him after Thor 80 minutes the 14 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.229
 to zero and then very fine interaction with Funky love cattle 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.759
 after 86 minutes the 15 back at the same time 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.360
 the closing point Bayern Munich presents itself in play and goal mood 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360
 and offer the traveling fans a true spectacle 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.250
 against a regional selection of Trentino 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.230
 an extremely entertaining 15 10
