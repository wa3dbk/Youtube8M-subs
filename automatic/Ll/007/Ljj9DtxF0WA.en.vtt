00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
fine facts which we'll see better when I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.219 
fine facts which we'll see better when I
clean<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> out

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
clean this out

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.999 
clean this out
so<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.759> went<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> triumph<00:01:30.289> after<00:01:31.289> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so I went out to the triumph after it's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
so I went out to the triumph after it's
hard<00:01:32.399> work<00:01:34.130> breaking<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> seal<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hard work breaking the seal on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.880 
hard work breaking the seal on the
tryouts<00:01:36.840> head<00:01:37.050> gasket<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 

composit<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.149> some<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.719> of<00:01:42.780> graphite

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
composit I think some kind of graphite

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.599 
composit I think some kind of graphite
type<00:01:43.789> nebulized<00:01:44.789> paper<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.219> here<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
type nebulized paper you know here I

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:54.230 
type nebulized paper you know here I
think<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.479> here<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:52.399> blow<00:01:53.399> out<00:01:53.640> from

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
think and here you can see blow out from

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649 
think and here you can see blow out from
the<00:01:54.560> ceiling<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.799> head<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.700> extreme

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the ceiling on the head and here extreme

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.499 
the ceiling on the head and here extreme
blow<00:01:57.929> out<00:01:58.110> fun<00:01:58.520> we'll<00:01:59.520> call<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.819> number<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
blow out fun we'll call it number one so

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.100 
blow out fun we'll call it number one so
under<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> guess<00:02:01.429> but<00:02:02.429> so<00:02:02.909> he<00:02:03.090> had<00:02:03.209> serious

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
under I guess but so he had serious

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
under I guess but so he had serious
damage<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.829> head<00:02:05.280> gasket<00:02:05.819> and<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.060> still

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
damage to the head gasket and it's still

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779 
damage to the head gasket and it's still
had<00:02:06.420> compression<00:02:06.959> so<00:02:07.369> what<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.549> do<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
had compression so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
had compression so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:08.970> make<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> composite<00:02:09.599> carbon<00:02:10.379> fiber

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I'm gonna make a composite carbon fiber

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
I'm gonna make a composite carbon fiber
gas<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.299> extra

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
gas because I think it's just the extra

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.809 
gas because I think it's just the extra
strength<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.319> will<00:02:13.500> need<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
strength that this will need I know a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.160 
strength that this will need I know a
lot<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.239> will<00:02:15.329> say<00:02:15.510> copy<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.959> topper

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
lot of you will say copy the topper

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.470 
lot of you will say copy the topper
topper<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.549> don't<00:02:17.610> try<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.209> I'm<00:02:18.299> not

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
topper but if I don't try then I'm not

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.620 
topper but if I don't try then I'm not
gonna<00:02:18.690> know<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:20.069> might<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.000> well<00:02:21.090> try<00:02:21.360> since

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
gonna know and I might as well try since

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.120 
gonna know and I might as well try since
I<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.049> take<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.380> heads<00:02:22.560> apart<00:02:22.920> quite

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I know how to take the heads apart quite

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.030 
I know how to take the heads apart quite
quickly<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:23.760> safely<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:25.739> look<00:02:25.829> at<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
quickly now safely so let's look at the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.680 
quickly now safely so let's look at the
trial<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:27.660> even<00:02:27.959> dirtier<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.670 

it's<00:02:32.380> valves<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.990> my<00:02:35.170> little<00:02:35.320> mix

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
it's valves you can see my little mix

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.280 
it's valves you can see my little mix
here<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.090> I'm<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.540> who<00:02:37.720> did<00:02:37.960> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
here so I'm the one who did it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.740 
here so I'm the one who did it
there's<00:02:39.280> some<00:02:39.520> Nicks<00:02:39.790> around<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.300> corners

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there's some Nicks around the corners

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.090 
there's some Nicks around the corners
here<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.740> from<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
here in here that was from the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.730 
here in here that was from the
screwdriver<00:02:45.640> barge<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.360> did<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740

screwdriver barge that I did just to
wiggler<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.520> test<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.050> breaking

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
wiggler just to test if it was breaking

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.870 
wiggler just to test if it was breaking
at<00:02:50.560> seal<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.250> was<00:02:54.430> your<00:02:54.490> nominee

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
at seal but if that was your nominee

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.820 
at seal but if that was your nominee
nice<00:02:55.240> shape

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
nice shape

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.380 
nice shape
and<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> guides<00:02:57.130> haven't<00:02:57.580> slipped<00:02:57.820> we'll

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
and the guides haven't slipped we'll

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.690 
and the guides haven't slipped we'll
definitely<00:02:58.570> take<00:02:58.990> them<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.290> check<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.520> this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
definitely take them in check but this

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.880 
definitely take them in check but this
is<00:03:00.820> gonna<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.150> lot<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.540> game<00:03:01.830> by<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
is gonna be a lot of game by the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.040 
is gonna be a lot of game by the
sandblasting<00:03:03.700> up<00:03:03.850> here<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:06.690> again<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
sandblasting up here and again if the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.200 
sandblasting up here and again if the
ports<00:03:08.470> look<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.770> same<00:03:08.980> as<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> BSA<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.030> I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
ports look the same as on the BSA so I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.200 
ports look the same as on the BSA so I
don't<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.480> if<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.930> port<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.350> or<00:03:11.500> not<00:03:11.650> but

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
don't know if it is port it or not but

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.970 
don't know if it is port it or not but
we'll<00:03:13.210> know<00:03:13.360> better<00:03:13.540> when<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.290> out<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
we'll know better when we get out the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.130 
we'll know better when we get out the
valves<00:03:15.970> themselves<00:03:16.120> which<00:03:16.660> looked<00:03:16.900> like<00:03:16.930> they

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
valves themselves which looked like they

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.040 
valves themselves which looked like they
had<00:03:17.320> full<00:03:17.850> width<00:03:18.850> ends<00:03:19.540> on

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
had full width ends on

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.570 
had full width ends on
they<00:03:21.170> don't<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.710> be<00:03:21.740> knifed<00:03:22.070> into<00:03:22.460> the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
they don't like to be knifed into the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.550 
they don't like to be knifed into the
head<00:03:22.760> too<00:03:22.970> much<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.660> they're<00:03:24.020> definitely<00:03:24.200> not

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
head too much and they're definitely not

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.610 
head too much and they're definitely not
pocketed<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.480> little<00:03:26.750> napping<00:03:27.230> won't<00:03:27.440> hurt

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
pocketed so a little napping won't hurt

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.930 
pocketed so a little napping won't hurt
it<00:03:27.770> because<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:28.040> maybe<00:03:28.160> since<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.700> more

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it because it maybe since the more

it because it maybe since the more
inside<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.570> head<00:03:29.750> here<00:03:38.710> see<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:39.890> better

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
inside the head here see that better

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.680 
inside the head here see that better
they're<00:03:42.130> mighty<00:03:43.130> waters<00:03:43.550> ready<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.270> have<00:03:44.510> to

they're mighty waters ready so I have to
make<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.860> short<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:49.430> looking<00:03:49.730> like

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
make this short but it's looking like
