after<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> ice<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.229> I'm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
after this is ice but I think what I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.340 
after this is ice but I think what I'm
gonna<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.619> first<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.900> just<00:01:09.900> mix<00:01:10.170> this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gonna do first is actually just mix this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
gonna do first is actually just mix this
up<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.150> why<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
up a little bit in here so why don't I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.910 
up a little bit in here so why don't I
do<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.000> add<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.450> ice

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
do that a little bit then add the ice

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
do that a little bit then add the ice
for<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.040> ice<00:01:23.189> cream

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.219 

probably

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.440 

okay<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:37.250> I'm<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.490> gonna<00:01:37.670> get<00:01:37.909> some<00:01:38.060> ice<00:01:38.240> add

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
okay so I'm just gonna get some ice add

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.139 
okay so I'm just gonna get some ice add
to<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.810> mix<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.890> we'll<00:01:40.130> see<00:01:40.310> how<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.700> ice

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
to the mix and we'll see how this ice

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.660 
to the mix and we'll see how this ice
creaking<00:01:41.710> okay<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.100> I'm<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:44.000> adding<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:44.960> cut

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
creaking okay so I'm now adding so cut

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.380 
creaking okay so I'm now adding so cut
just<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.729> little<00:01:46.759> bit<00:01:46.969> over<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.420> cup<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:49.390> my

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
just a little bit over a cup of my

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.510 
just a little bit over a cup of my
liquid<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:54.579> adding<00:01:55.579> ice<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:57.979> probably

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
liquid and adding ice this is probably

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.050 
liquid and adding ice this is probably
good<00:01:59.619> it's<00:02:00.619> like<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.740> three-to-one<00:02:01.159> ratio

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
good it's like a three-to-one ratio

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.979 
good it's like a three-to-one ratio
I<00:02:04.030> think<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:05.119> stopping<00:02:05.539> there<00:02:07.690> then<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.229 

I'm<00:02:32.680> stopping<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.340> let<00:02:33.819> me<00:02:33.909> just<00:02:34.120> check
