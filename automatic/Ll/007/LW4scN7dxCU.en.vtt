want a big reward for an ottoman a
pretty<00:02:00.170> consistent<00:02:00.650> season<00:02:00.950> yeah<00:02:01.340> people

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
pretty consistent season yeah people

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.920 
pretty consistent season yeah people
have<00:02:01.700> asked<00:02:01.880> me<00:02:01.909> about<00:02:02.150> what's<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
have asked me about what's the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.749 
have asked me about what's the
difference<00:02:03.229> between<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:04.070> know<00:02:04.159> wembling<00:02:04.549> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759

difference between you know wembling and
the<00:02:05.270> gunfire<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.659> think<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.439> one<00:02:06.649> serves<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:07.040> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
the gunfire I think this one serves up a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.219 
the gunfire I think this one serves up a
lot<00:02:07.520> better<00:02:07.610> atmosphere<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.140> know

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
lot better atmosphere and then you know

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.990 
lot better atmosphere and then you know
me<00:02:09.440> really<00:02:09.590> looking<00:02:09.920> forward<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.280> how<00:02:10.729> many<00:02:10.789> we

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
know one of the fastest games I probably

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
know one of the fastest games I probably
bleeding<00:02:40.580> especially<00:02:41.120> from<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.390> start<00:02:41.660> but

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
bleeding especially from the start but

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.559 
bleeding especially from the start but
uh<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.370> against<00:02:43.610> wigan<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.000> think<00:02:44.209> this

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
uh you know against wigan I think this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.420 
uh you know against wigan I think this
year<00:02:44.780> for<00:02:44.959> they've<00:02:45.110> gone<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.260> bit<00:02:45.319> be<00:02:46.040> even<00:02:46.280> more

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
year for they've gone a bit be even more

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.729 
year for they've gone a bit be even more
so<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.030> know<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> super<00:02:48.170> league<00:02:48.350> games<00:02:48.560> that

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
so you know the super league games that

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.900 
so you know the super league games that
we've<00:02:48.860> had<00:02:48.950> against<00:02:49.160> wigan<00:02:49.459> over<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.670> past

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
we've had against wigan over the past

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.539 
we've had against wigan over the past
two<00:02:50.060> years<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.510> been<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.980> fast<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
two years have been really fast and

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.449 
two years have been really fast and
really<00:02:52.850> intense<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.900> think<00:02:54.890> comes<00:02:55.100> acting

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
really intense and I think comes acting

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490 
really intense and I think comes acting
like<00:02:55.610> said<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.910> occasion<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.600> isn't<00:02:57.049> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
like said the occasion that it isn't and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.960 
like said the occasion that it isn't and
the<00:02:57.920> prize<00:02:58.130> that's<00:02:58.340> an<00:02:58.489> offer<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> end

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
the prize that's an offer at the end

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.610 
the prize that's an offer at the end
it's<00:02:59.150> probably<00:02:59.390> got<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> bit<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.110> I'll<00:03:00.260> take<00:03:00.470> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
it's probably got a bit and I'll take it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.620 
it's probably got a bit and I'll take it
up<00:03:00.709> another<00:03:00.830> level<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.730> see<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> fireworks
