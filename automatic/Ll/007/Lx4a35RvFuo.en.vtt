00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.190 
alright guys so we got a good portion of
the<00:00:33.790> storm<00:00:34.120> was<00:00:34.360> done<00:00:37.650> last<00:00:38.650> time<00:00:40.020> nothing<00:00:41.020> was

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
the storm was done last time nothing was

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.640 
the storm was done last time nothing was
magnetized<00:00:41.620> up<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:47.230> didn't<00:00:47.470> want<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
magnetized up I really didn't want to

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.600 
magnetized up I really didn't want to
leave<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:47.980> piece<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.930> magnetized<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
leave this piece I'm magnetized and I

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.100 
leave this piece I'm magnetized and I
really<00:00:54.940> didn't<00:00:55.120> want<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.300> ruin<00:00:55.480> this<00:00:55.720> detail

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
really didn't want to ruin this detail

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.229 
really didn't want to ruin this detail
here<00:00:56.470> so<00:00:57.460> I<00:00:57.850> put<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.540> magnet<00:00:58.989> right<00:00:59.650> there<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:01.180> I

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
here so I put a magnet right there now I

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.680 
here so I put a magnet right there now I
made<00:01:01.780> my<00:01:01.930> whole<00:01:02.110> little<00:01:02.440> bigger<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:04.420> not<00:01:04.630> sure

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
made my whole little bigger I'm not sure

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.260 
made my whole little bigger I'm not sure
if<00:01:05.170> I'm<00:01:05.350> going<00:01:05.380> to<00:01:08.340> scream<00:01:09.340> stuff<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.940> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
if I'm going to scream stuff that and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.030 
if I'm going to scream stuff that and
try<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.840> get<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.110> as<00:01:11.140> flush<00:01:11.470> as<00:01:11.500> possible

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
try and get it as flush as possible

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.710 
try and get it as flush as possible
which<00:01:12.160> i<00:01:12.280> think<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.640> going<00:01:12.789> to<00:01:12.880> be<00:01:12.910> might<00:01:13.539> be<00:01:13.690> a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
which i think is going to be might be a

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.570 
which i think is going to be might be a
little<00:01:13.899> hard<00:01:14.229> because<00:01:14.350> there's<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.190> rivets

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
little hard because there's the rivets

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.760 
little hard because there's the rivets
and<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.880> bolts<00:01:16.240> there<00:01:16.450> should<00:01:17.410> be<00:01:17.500> hard<00:01:17.680> to

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
and the bolts there should be hard to

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.880 
and the bolts there should be hard to
file<00:01:17.979> down<00:01:21.270> i'll<00:01:22.270> probably<00:01:22.690> end<00:01:22.930> up<00:01:23.229> finding

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
file down i'll probably end up finding

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.499 
file down i'll probably end up finding
something<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.700> i<00:01:25.180> can<00:01:26.490> magnetize<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:28.030> there

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
something that i can magnetize on there

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.530 
something that i can magnetize on there
may<00:01:28.780> be<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.880> type<00:01:31.149> of<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.970> am<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.270> going<00:01:34.420> to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
may be some type of what am I going to

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
may be some type of what am I going to
do<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:35.020> don't<00:01:35.290> know<00:01:35.380> something<00:01:35.890> like<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:37.210> know

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
do I don't know something like you know

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.100 
do I don't know something like you know
I'll<00:01:39.790> make<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:40.360> not<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.840> look<00:01:40.930> this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
I'll make it it's not going to look this

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.530 
I'll make it it's not going to look this
cheesy<00:01:41.439> but<00:01:41.820> something<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.360> don't

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
cheesy but something like that I don't

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.190 
cheesy but something like that I don't
know<00:01:43.600> either<00:01:43.750> some<00:01:44.350> kind<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.650> antenna<00:01:45.100> or<00:01:46.650> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
know either some kind of antenna or I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530 
know either some kind of antenna or I
don't<00:01:50.200> know<00:01:50.380> something<00:01:51.090> I'll<00:01:52.090> figure<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.420> out

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
don't know something I'll figure it out

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.740 
don't know something I'll figure it out
later<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.400> really<00:01:54.729> wanted<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.600> not

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
later but I really wanted this to not

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.580 
later but I really wanted this to not
just<00:01:56.020> be<00:01:56.110> sitting<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.770> wanted<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.460> really

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just be sitting I wanted it to really

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.590 
just be sitting I wanted it to really
lock<00:01:59.590> down<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.000> set<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:07.299> in<00:02:07.420> there

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
lock down when I want to set it in there

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.770 
lock down when I want to set it in there
so<00:02:08.590> yeah<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.369> saw<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.759> before<00:02:12.780> everything's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so yeah you saw it before everything's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.340 
so yeah you saw it before everything's
got<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> nice

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
got a nice

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.320 
got a nice
a<00:02:17.080> nice<00:02:18.080> hold

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.210 

I<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:24.020> four<00:02:24.500> magnets<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.310> inside<00:02:25.790> i<00:02:27.220> used

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
I have four magnets on the inside i used

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.340 
I have four magnets on the inside i used
i<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.820> used<00:02:29.000> superglue<00:02:29.360> that's<00:02:30.020> why<00:02:30.170> it's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
i just used superglue that's why it's

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.140 
i just used superglue that's why it's
all<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.860> white<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.340> inside<00:02:31.490> i<00:02:31.790> used

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
all kind of white on the inside i used

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150 
all kind of white on the inside i used
super<00:02:32.450> good<00:02:32.630> first<00:02:32.960> just<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.290> set<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.620> magnets

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
super good first just to set the magnets

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.950 
super good first just to set the magnets
where<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.340> wanted<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:35.720> i<00:02:35.750> went

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
where I wanted them and then i went

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.100 
where I wanted them and then i went
ahead<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.290> reinforced<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.250> with<00:02:37.310> green<00:02:37.640> stuff

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
ahead and reinforced it with green stuff

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.140 
ahead and reinforced it with green stuff
afterwards<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> green<00:02:39.380> stuff<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.800> actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
afterwards the green stuff is actually

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.540 
afterwards the green stuff is actually
not<00:02:41.150> fully<00:02:41.510> dry<00:02:41.840> yet<00:02:44.680> yeah<00:02:45.680> they're<00:02:46.040> pretty

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
not fully dry yet yeah they're pretty

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.870 
not fully dry yet yeah they're pretty
solid<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.930> good<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:49.250> only<00:02:49.400> need<00:02:49.580> two

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
solid it's good you only need two

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.320 
solid it's good you only need two
magnets<00:02:50.330> here<00:02:51.250> again<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.370> put<00:02:52.610> set<00:02:53.120> them<00:02:53.270> in

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
magnets here again I put set them in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.180 
magnets here again I put set them in
with<00:02:53.540> superglue<00:02:54.260> first<00:02:54.620> then<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> little

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
with superglue first then put a little

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.590 
with superglue first then put a little
green<00:02:55.490> stuff<00:02:55.730> around<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> edges<00:02:56.270> here

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
green stuff around the edges here

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.850 
green stuff around the edges here
because<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.930> can't<00:02:57.110> really<00:02:57.290> put<00:02:57.470> any<00:02:57.560> over

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
because you can't really put any over

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.780 
because you can't really put any over
here<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.280> way<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.400> did<00:02:58.700> it<00:03:00.250> what<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> did<00:03:01.580> was<00:03:01.610> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
here the way I did it what I did was I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.000 
here the way I did it what I did was I
don't<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.209> it'll<00:03:02.390> show<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.140> there's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
don't know if it'll show but there's

in there I just took a pencil trace it
out<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.570> then<00:03:14.600> put<00:03:15.530> my<00:03:16.220> magnet<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:17.300> my

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
out and then put my magnet for my

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.330 
out and then put my magnet for my
magnets<00:03:17.810> not<00:03:17.930> an<00:03:18.050> easy<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.410> find<00:03:18.620> place<00:03:19.010> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
magnets not an easy to find place I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.820 
magnets not an easy to find place I
first<00:03:19.610> started<00:03:19.910> out<00:03:20.030> with<00:03:20.150> these<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.660> pop<00:03:21.560> them

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
first started out with these to pop them

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.880 
first started out with these to pop them
in<00:03:21.950> there<00:03:22.190> marked<00:03:22.610> out<00:03:22.760> whether<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.120> be<00:03:23.890> and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
in there marked out whether it be and
