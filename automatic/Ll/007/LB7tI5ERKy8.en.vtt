have we were gettin from
the<00:01:07.050> engine<00:01:07.350> manufacturers<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.190> mercury<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the engine manufacturers like mercury we

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.400 
the engine manufacturers like mercury we
had<00:01:08.940> so<00:01:09.060> much<00:01:09.150> horsepower<00:01:09.570> work<00:01:09.870> with<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.290> we

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
had so much horsepower work with that we

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.470 
had so much horsepower work with that we
headed<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.800> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> development<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
headed to a lot of development on the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.110 
headed to a lot of development on the
hull<00:01:13.050> designs<00:01:13.440> near<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.250> energizer<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
hull designs near that energizer that I

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.540 
hull designs near that energizer that I
was<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.930> able<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.260> utilize<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.340> kind

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
was just to be able to utilize the kind

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.880 
was just to be able to utilize the kind
of<00:01:17.640> horsepower<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.540> were<00:01:18.690> been<00:01:19.620> able<00:01:19.800> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of horsepower that we were been able to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.790 
of horsepower that we were been able to
get<00:01:20.130> her<00:01:20.220> hands<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.200> did<00:01:22.560> get

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
get her hands off so when you did get

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560 
get her hands off so when you did get
into<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.160> offshore<00:01:23.610> game<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.210> started

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
into the offshore game you started

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.570 
into the offshore game you started
building<00:01:24.690> offshore<00:01:25.290> boats<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.190> took<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
building offshore boats you took the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
building offshore boats you took the
standard<00:01:27.000> era<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.900> Magnum<00:01:28.710> style<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.280> hull<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
standard era no Magnum style of hull and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.830 
standard era no Magnum style of hull and
then<00:01:29.850> developed<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.540> there

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
then developed it from there

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.620 
then developed it from there
yeah<00:01:31.620> I<00:01:31.710> took<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.100> basic<00:01:32.580> design<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.480> they

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
yeah I took the basic design that they

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570 
yeah I took the basic design that they
had<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.130> only<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.310> was

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
had which is about the only thing was

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.150 
had which is about the only thing was
left<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> 24°<00:01:36.870> lead<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.680> worked<00:01:37.950> with

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
left with a 24° lead and worked with

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.660 
left with a 24° lead and worked with
that<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.760> just<00:01:39.380> took<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.590> dead<00:01:41.100> rise<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that and just took that dead rise and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.820 
that and just took that dead rise and
started<00:01:42.210> changing<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.080> looking<00:01:43.470> streaks

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
started changing the looking streaks

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.540 
started changing the looking streaks
with<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.430> depth<00:01:44.670> locations<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.650> water

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
with the depth locations up and water

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.640 
with the depth locations up and water
and<00:01:47.850> waves<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> bounced<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.020> same<00:01:49.260> just

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
and waves and bounced all the same just

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.270 
and waves and bounced all the same just
the<00:01:49.710> offshore<00:01:50.190> boat<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.670> bigger<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.619> 1978

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the offshore boat is bigger and in 1978

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
the offshore boat is bigger and in 1978
Steve<00:01:53.940> rocked<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.540> offshore<00:01:54.900> world<00:01:55.140> by

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
Steve rocked the offshore world by

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
Steve rocked the offshore world by

as we looked accidents over the years

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100 
as we looked accidents over the years
we've<00:02:09.940> definitely<00:02:10.180> got<00:02:10.570> our<00:02:10.750> share<00:02:11.050> of

records and I think that really put that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.840 
records and I think that really put that

construction of what we do with offshore

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
construction of what we do with offshore
racing<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.760> absolutely<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.780> most<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:24.400> best

which is one of the few boats that has

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.730 
which is one of the few boats that has
it<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.660> really<00:02:46.840> nice<00:02:47.080> because<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.530> runs

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
it and it's really nice because it runs

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.910 
it and it's really nice because it runs
fast<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.490> calm<00:02:49.180> water<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:50.200> also<00:02:50.380> got<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> long

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
fast in calm water it's also got a long

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.200 
fast in calm water it's also got a long
bottom<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.490> makes<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.820> nice<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.060> a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
bottom so it makes it really nice and a

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.050 
bottom so it makes it really nice and a
rough<00:02:52.360> water<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> things<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.880> find

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
rough water and one of the things I find

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.250 
rough water and one of the things I find
really<00:02:55.180> interesting<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.750> everyone's<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.200> of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
really interesting is everyone's one of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.990 
really interesting is everyone's one of
these<00:02:56.380> ventilate<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.800> bottom<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.730> they

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
these ventilate the bottom and they

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.270 
these ventilate the bottom and they
cannot<00:02:58.300> turn<00:02:58.570> with<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> velocity<00:02:59.250> which<00:03:00.250> is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
cannot turn with a velocity which is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.710 
cannot turn with a velocity which is
really<00:03:00.580> important<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.030> days<00:03:01.090> expect<00:03:01.540> in

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
really important these days expect in

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.600 
really important these days expect in
racing<00:03:02.050> circuit<00:03:02.410> getting<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.220> much<00:03:03.340> shorter

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
racing circuit getting so much shorter
