00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
just this is about to heat will stop and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.859 
just this is about to heat will stop and
then<00:01:25.530> zoom<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.270> were<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.720> a

angle oh okay bc losses of course that's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
angle oh okay bc losses of course that's
not<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.079> good<00:01:40.229> you've<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> keep<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
not very good you've got to keep the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.859 
not very good you've got to keep the
Corsairs<00:01:41.790> low<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.659> great

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
Corsairs low but it's good for great

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510 
Corsairs low but it's good for great
it's<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.680> great<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.280> good

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's good for great but it's not good

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's good for great but it's not good
for<00:01:44.549> beating<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:46.170> um<00:01:46.530> okay<00:01:47.159> what's<00:01:47.369> happening

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
for beating now um okay what's happening

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149 
for beating now um okay what's happening
he's<00:01:47.939> got<00:01:48.090> Overlord<00:01:48.630> speed<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.259> quick<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
he's got Overlord speed pretty quick so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.060 
he's got Overlord speed pretty quick so
imagine<00:01:50.610> he<00:01:50.790> wants<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:52.259> well<00:01:52.860> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
imagine he wants to go for well this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.160 
imagine he wants to go for well this
looks<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> typical<00:01:53.729> five<00:01:54.479> hat<00:01:54.750> Hydra<00:01:55.409> push

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
looks like a typical five hat Hydra push

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
he's just got his speed upgrade and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300 
he's just got his speed upgrade and
maybe<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.410> he's<00:02:35.560> getting<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.070> plus

maybe just now he's getting it on plus
upgrade<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.000> well<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.750> hopefully<00:02:38.110> we<00:02:38.440> ought<00:02:38.530> to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
upgrade as well so hopefully we ought to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.820 
upgrade as well so hopefully we ought to
take<00:02:38.800> care<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.130> those<00:02:39.840> those<00:02:40.840> hydrogen<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.530> not

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
take care of those those hydrogen is not

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.870

think<00:02:43.300> he's<00:02:44.230> going<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.530> see<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.430> is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
think he's going to be there see this is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.890 
think he's going to be there see this is
what<00:02:45.670> i<00:02:45.730> don't<00:02:45.910> like<00:02:45.970> about<00:02:46.060> Protoss<00:02:46.600> as<00:02:46.750> well

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
what i don't like about Protoss as well

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
to do what's happening here he's just

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.270 
to do what's happening here he's just
outside<00:03:10.630> his<00:03:10.959> base<00:03:11.170> i<00:03:11.470> think<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.070> going<00:03:12.220> to

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
outside his base i think is going to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.650 
outside his base i think is going to
push<00:03:12.489> now<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.090> probably<00:03:13.330> take<00:03:13.450> down<00:03:13.630> that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
push now you can probably take down that

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.660 
push now you can probably take down that

what's<00:06:14.180> basic<00:06:14.689> going<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.870> do<00:06:14.960> to<00:06:15.080> counter<00:06:15.439> this

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
what's basic going to do to counter this

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.739 
what's basic going to do to counter this
he<00:06:16.520> needs<00:06:16.729> to<00:06:16.849> do<00:06:16.939> something<00:06:17.210> he<00:06:17.389> needs<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.629> do

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
you know with Hydra speed it makes it be

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.129 
you know with Hydra speed it makes it be
difficult<00:06:24.529> because<00:06:24.710> ah<00:06:26.800> no<00:06:28.689> Let<00:06:29.689> Go<00:06:29.719> Go
