00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.200

 although it is unknown that all ponies are all here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.530

 Well, roughly today or tomorrow means 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.159
 there will be a finished device we will have a wire 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.420

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 which part of the detail remained only 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 holders become jumper jumpers 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.250
 here is this cell 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.250
 Well, most likely you will have to replace 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.170
 wire going from here to here to it 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.610
