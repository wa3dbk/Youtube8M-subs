00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the floor throughout the movement so we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.180 
the floor throughout the movement so we
start<00:02:14.130> adding<00:02:14.310> more<00:02:14.610> complexity<00:02:15.510> by<00:02:15.690> moving

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
start adding more complexity by moving

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.009 
start adding more complexity by moving
different<00:02:17.190> parts<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.790> different<00:02:18.090> ways<00:02:21.019> the

different parts in different ways the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.229 
different parts in different ways the
