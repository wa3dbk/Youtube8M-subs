better and better

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.559 
better and better
yeah<00:02:26.880> they're<00:02:27.560> all<00:02:28.700> across<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.849> board<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
yeah they're all across the board the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.039

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
been my problem with this you know with

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
been my problem with this you know with
with<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.880> cheaper<00:02:54.239> mark<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:56.360> Panzer<00:02:57.360> fours
