00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I'd only have this toy open for about a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
I'd only have this toy open for about a
day<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.700> know

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
day and so that's not me so I don't know

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
day and so that's not me so I don't know
why<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.869> paint<00:01:49.140> quality<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
why the paint quality on this is so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
why the paint quality on this is so
shoddy<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:51.030> terms<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.540> accessories<00:01:52.170> he<00:01:52.320> comes

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
shoddy in terms of accessories he comes

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.209 
shoddy in terms of accessories he comes
with<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.990> that's<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.259> even<00:01:55.950> smoke

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with this and that's it even smoke

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
with this and that's it even smoke
screen<00:01:56.520> came<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.049> with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> armor

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
screen came with this with the armor

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.990 
screen came with this with the armor
this<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.189> came<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.399> smoke<00:01:59.700> screen

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this with this came with smoke screen

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.770 
this with this came with smoke screen
and<00:02:01.189> Howell<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.399> gets<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.640> tiny<00:02:03.270> tiny<00:02:03.509> gun

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and Howell just gets a tiny tiny gun

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
and Howell just gets a tiny tiny gun
with<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> missile<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:04.950> big<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
with a missile is way too big for so you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
with a missile is way too big for so you
take<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.840> muscle<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.500> he's<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
take the muscle out and he's got a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.150 
take the muscle out and he's got a
handgun

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
handgun

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.410 
handgun
I<00:02:09.550> guess<00:02:10.540> prowl<00:02:10.930> is<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> police<00:02:11.560> officer<00:02:12.070> and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
I guess prowl is a police officer and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.580 
I guess prowl is a police officer and
normally<00:02:13.420> police<00:02:13.660> officers<00:02:14.080> only<00:02:14.200> carry

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
normally police officers only carry

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.570 
normally police officers only carry
handguns<00:02:15.100> least<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.730> America<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.370> guess

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
handguns least in America so I guess

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.300 
handguns least in America so I guess
that<00:02:19.030> kind<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.360> works<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.870> really<00:02:20.310> smoke

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
that kind of works but really smoke

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.370 
that kind of works but really smoke
screen<00:02:21.640> came<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.240> gun<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.780> exact<00:02:23.110> same

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
can put it in the middle of the flashing

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.210 
can put it in the middle of the flashing
lights<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:38.020> put<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.560> either<00:02:38.950> side

lights or you can put it on either side
of<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.550> spoiler<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.350> really<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.740> you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
of the spoiler so it's really up to you

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.720 
of the spoiler so it's really up to you
the<00:02:42.580> transformation<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.540> very<00:02:44.200> complex<00:02:44.740> we're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the transformation is very complex we're

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.460 
the transformation is very complex we're
just<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.120> smokes<00:02:46.420> doing<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> same<00:02:46.990> old<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
just like smokes doing the same old and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.290 
just like smokes doing the same old and
there<00:02:48.160> are<00:02:48.220> no<00:02:48.340> changes<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
there are no changes to the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.390 
there are no changes to the
transformation<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.770> just<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.160> head

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
transformation and it's just the head

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.390 
transformation and it's just the head
sculpt<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:51.880> been<00:02:52.030> remoulded<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.400> so

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
sculpt that's been remoulded and so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.130 
sculpt that's been remoulded and so
let's<00:02:54.520> get<00:02:54.640> started<00:02:54.790> now<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.780> quite<00:02:56.110> a

most<00:03:39.459> annoying<00:03:39.670> part<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.090> transformation

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
most annoying part of the transformation

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.750 
most annoying part of the transformation
and<00:03:40.870> next<00:03:41.770> thing<00:03:41.890> we're<00:03:42.130> going<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.520> is

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
and next thing we're going to do is

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.449 
and next thing we're going to do is
we're<00:03:43.630> going<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> come<00:03:43.959> over<00:03:44.110> here<00:03:44.220> split<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
we're going to come over here split the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.440 
we're going to come over here split the
front<00:03:45.940> bumper<00:03:46.770> just<00:03:47.770> like<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.190> take<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> head

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
front bumper just like so take the head

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.479 
front bumper just like so take the head
we<00:03:50.200> can<00:03:50.320> just<00:03:50.410> off<00:03:50.560> push<00:03:50.830> that<00:03:51.010> through<00:03:51.250> there

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
we can just off push that through there

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.060 
we can just off push that through there
and<00:03:51.820> there<00:03:52.570> is<00:03:52.720> his<00:03:52.750> head<00:03:53.140> we're<00:03:53.890> going<00:03:53.980> to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and there is his head we're going to

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.790 
and there is his head we're going to
take<00:03:54.280> these<00:03:54.910> wheels<00:03:55.239> here<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.810> sort<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.500> angle

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
take these wheels here and sort of angle

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.180 
take these wheels here and sort of angle
them<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:57.540> there<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.959> spokes<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.770> peg<00:04:00.160> in

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
them in there so the spokes of a peg in

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.780 
them in there so the spokes of a peg in
and<00:04:00.970> act<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.300> little<00:04:01.570> tab<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:03.040> there<00:04:03.280> are<00:04:03.489> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
and act as little tab and there are the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.370 
and act as little tab and there are the
arms<00:04:04.030> pegged<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:05.080> we<00:04:05.140> can<00:04:05.290> just

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
arms pegged in then we can just

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.280 
arms pegged in then we can just
literally<00:04:05.620> just<00:04:05.830> lift<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> arms<00:04:06.610> up<00:04:07.290> rotate

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
literally just lift the arms up rotate

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.530 
literally just lift the arms up rotate
them<00:04:08.380> around<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:09.040> there<00:04:09.520> are<00:04:09.730> his<00:04:09.970> arms<00:04:12.540> it's

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
them around and there are his arms it's

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.840 
them around and there are his arms it's
really<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.350> fiddly<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.400> kind<00:04:15.760> of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
really really fiddly to do it's kind of

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.890 
really really fiddly to do it's kind of
hard<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.330> actually<00:04:16.570> film<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:19.390> there<00:04:19.780> we<00:04:19.870> go

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
hard to actually film and so there we go

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.500 
hard to actually film and so there we go
then<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.710> can<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:20.859> take<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.460> piece<00:04:21.700> up<00:04:21.850> here

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
then we can just take this piece up here

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.930 
then we can just take this piece up here
flip<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.170> up<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.770> will<00:04:23.920> peg<00:04:24.370> in<00:04:24.520> and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
flip that up and that will peg in and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.630 
flip that up and that will peg in and
that's<00:04:25.150> actually<00:04:25.270> miss<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.870> tablet<00:04:26.550> there<00:04:27.550> we

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
that's actually miss the tablet there we

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.470 
that's actually miss the tablet there we
go<00:04:29.220> come<00:04:30.220> around<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.580> these<00:04:30.760> door<00:04:31.000> panels<00:04:31.030> up

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
go come around to these door panels up

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.590 
go come around to these door panels up
here<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.560> then<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.770> flip<00:04:33.100> these<00:04:33.220> up<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:34.450> they

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
here and then you flip these up and they

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.890 
here and then you flip these up and they
will<00:04:34.690> peg<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.050> at<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> top<00:04:36.010> there<00:04:36.540> now<00:04:37.540> as<00:04:37.720> for

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
will peg in at the top there now as for

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.810 
will peg in at the top there now as for
the<00:04:37.990> windows<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.740> leave<00:04:38.980> them<00:04:39.100> up<00:04:39.400> or<00:04:39.730> you

can flip them down personally I like to

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.050 
can flip them down personally I like to
leave<00:04:41.980> them<00:04:42.100> up<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:42.580> really<00:04:42.700> hot<00:04:42.880> as

prowl in his robot mode now in robot
mode<00:05:07.990> there<00:05:08.290> is<00:05:08.410> quite<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.740> lot<00:05:08.980> more<00:05:09.160> going<00:05:09.340> on

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
honestly the robot mode just pops a lot

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.910 
honestly the robot mode just pops a lot
more<00:05:16.810> than<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.080> vehicle<00:05:17.380> mode<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.770> looks

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
more than the vehicle mode and it looks

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.730

little<00:06:11.950> bit<00:06:12.100> as<00:06:12.310> for<00:06:12.730> the<00:06:12.760> accessories

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
little bit as for the accessories

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.060

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
and you can pack them in his hand but if

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.680 
and you can pack them in his hand but if
yours<00:06:17.410> are<00:06:17.590> smoke<00:06:17.920> screen<00:06:18.220> like<00:06:18.430> I<00:06:18.580> do<00:06:18.640> and<00:06:19.030> we

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
yours are smoke screen like I do and we

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.120 
yours are smoke screen like I do and we
can<00:06:19.810> give<00:06:19.990> them<00:06:20.050> smoke<00:06:20.350> screens<00:06:20.650> gone<00:06:20.890> and

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
can give them smoke screens gone and

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.130 
can give them smoke screens gone and
make<00:06:21.520> him<00:06:21.670> dual<00:06:21.940> wield<00:06:22.240> which<00:06:22.390> looks<00:06:22.660> really

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
make him dual wield which looks really

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.170 
make him dual wield which looks really
cool<00:06:23.380> if<00:06:23.500> you<00:06:23.590> ask<00:06:23.650> me<00:06:23.950> and<00:06:24.220> you<00:06:24.820> can<00:06:24.940> do<00:06:25.030> that

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
cool if you ask me and you can do that

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.450

for<00:06:25.390> either<00:06:25.660> figure<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:26.320> but<00:06:26.890> honestly<00:06:27.220> I

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
for either figure and but honestly I

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.460 
for either figure and but honestly I
think<00:06:28.270> you<00:06:28.540> should<00:06:28.690> give<00:06:28.810> them<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:28.990> extra<00:06:29.200> gun

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
think you should give them the extra gun

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.380 
think you should give them the extra gun
because<00:06:29.680> it<00:06:29.800> just<00:06:29.860> looks<00:06:30.070> way<00:06:30.490> way<00:06:30.700> cooler<00:06:31.030> as

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
because it just looks way way cooler as

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.780 
because it just looks way way cooler as

there's<00:07:29.230> a<00:07:29.290> little<00:07:29.830> bit<00:07:29.980> too<00:07:30.160> tight<00:07:30.190> and<00:07:30.970> when

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
there's a little bit too tight and when

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.670 
there's a little bit too tight and when
you<00:07:31.330> whenever<00:07:31.690> you<00:07:31.900> try<00:07:32.110> and<00:07:32.260> actually<00:07:32.350> get

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
you whenever you try and actually get

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.440 
you whenever you try and actually get
them<00:07:32.800> into<00:07:32.980> a<00:07:33.010> pose<00:07:33.280> you<00:07:33.670> can<00:07:33.700> sometimes<00:07:34.180> knock

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.450 
them into a pose you can sometimes knock

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.130 
them into a pose you can sometimes knock
everything<00:07:34.780> else<00:07:35.050> all<00:07:35.260> out<00:07:35.410> of<00:07:35.470> alignment<00:07:37.140> so

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140 
everything else all out of alignment so

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.980 
everything else all out of alignment so
yeah<00:07:38.350> that's<00:07:38.710> just<00:07:38.970> quality<00:07:39.970> control<00:07:40.360> overall

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
yeah that's just quality control overall

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.320 
yeah that's just quality control overall
I<00:07:41.020> think<00:07:41.290> prowl<00:07:42.070> is<00:07:42.220> a<00:07:42.340> solid<00:07:42.670> repaint<00:07:43.120> of<00:07:43.270> a

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
I think prowl is a solid repaint of a

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.290 
I think prowl is a solid repaint of a
gray<00:07:43.630> mold<00:07:43.900> and<00:07:44.230> honestly<00:07:45.100> I<00:07:45.400> recommend<00:07:46.090> him

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300 
gray mold and honestly I recommend him

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.540 
gray mold and honestly I recommend him
