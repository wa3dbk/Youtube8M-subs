00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.060
 wealth and treasure 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 not so easy at first 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 task because the cache requires 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.619
 secret words listed such as 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.869

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.140
 took power 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:53.610
 use wings and head to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.390
 tavern naked drowning chic 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.770
 rank 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.810
 for tavern but by the way practically on 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.909
 any island in any location first 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 should talk innkeeper how 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.479
 the rule is they talkative a lot of things 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.410
 interesting can tell he won 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.340
 certain icon is given 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.190
 the innkeeper go to him and find out 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.260
 the details of how we are open bald ron 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.050
 we ask him knows the secret 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.170
 the door he says he heard one 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.810
 the pirate once boasted about it we 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.590
 find out where the pirate is and say that he died 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.420
 as a result, we have updated the magazine and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.780
 There is such a point how to talk 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.019
 dead pirate 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.030
 I first thought where to find it 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.390
 deceased grades begin on where it is 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.580
 grave and at first I found quite well in 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:03.220
 reasonable and logical place like this 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.230
 ios5 lucky principle and even landed yet 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.820
 there was nothing here except 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.239
 chest nothing about the way about the children even 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.360
 just demonstrate that here 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.430
 there are money 19,000 almost all but 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.340
 no action takes place here 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.280
 so this is absolutely no one place 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.940
 and we are just headed for this 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.130
 the place actually finding it was not 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.269
 so just because this place 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.250
 absolutely shit here and ships that 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.930
 there find concentrate even 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.700
 to focus attention for me personally 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.290
 was problematic in fact she 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.079
 there is a grave to the left here in this 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.940
 areas from the tavern dead man's chest from 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.750
 Here approximately on this area 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.150
 be guided 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.710
 more accurate right now stumble 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.130
 on not here it is 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.210
 here she is this grave dig up 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.750
 dig up 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:11.570
 we talk to him ask to give 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.010
 secret code he refuses requests 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:19.580
 eat fresh fish soup instead 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.380
 Well, I want a pirate so check not 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.600

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.770
 guessed that sea devil 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.780
 this fish is probably many have not guessed 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.790
 no wonder because this unit is not 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.450
 few people are popular with him 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.920
 So he hires the right note close 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.790

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.770
