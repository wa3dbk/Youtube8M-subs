00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
and they look really really cool in

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.600 
and they look really really cool in
photos<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.549> photojournalism<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.810> average

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
photos so photojournalism in average

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.780 
photos so photojournalism in average
kind<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:44.030> it's<00:03:44.570> like<00:03:44.900> an<00:03:45.080> odd<00:03:45.380> mix<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:48.790> degrees

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
kind of it's like an odd mix of degrees

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.090 
kind of it's like an odd mix of degrees
at<00:03:50.540> first<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.170> thought<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.470> was<00:03:51.620> being<00:03:51.770> clever

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
at first I thought I was being clever

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.050 
at first I thought I was being clever
and<00:03:52.490> that<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.780> had<00:03:54.020> a<00:03:54.050> degree<00:03:54.410> in

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
and that if I had a degree in

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.810 
and that if I had a degree in
photojournalism<00:03:56.060> or<00:03:56.780> photography<00:03:57.380> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
photojournalism or photography and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.460 
photojournalism or photography and
advertising<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.060> was<00:03:59.180> kind<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.510> a<00:04:00.340> way<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.370> be

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
advertising it was kind of a way to be

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.960 
advertising it was kind of a way to be
prepared<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.620> do<00:04:03.770> commercial<00:04:04.400> photography

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
prepared to do commercial photography

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.690 
prepared to do commercial photography
well<00:04:05.720> that's<00:04:05.900> not<00:04:06.110> exactly<00:04:06.470> how<00:04:06.860> degrees<00:04:07.490> work

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
well that's not exactly how degrees work

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.300 
well that's not exactly how degrees work
you<00:04:08.090> can't<00:04:08.360> just<00:04:08.720> have<00:04:09.530> two<00:04:09.709> degrees<00:04:10.040> and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
you can't just have two degrees and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.040 
you can't just have two degrees and
create<00:04:10.910> your<00:04:11.030> own<00:04:11.180> investment<00:04:11.660> because<00:04:11.959> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
create your own investment because the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.540 
create your own investment because the
classes<00:04:12.260> don't<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.650> should<00:04:12.920> go<00:04:13.040> hand<00:04:13.250> in<00:04:13.340> hand

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
classes don't I should go hand in hand

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.370 
classes don't I should go hand in hand
like<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:14.300> really<00:04:14.750> wanted<00:04:14.990> to<00:04:15.050> do

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
like that I really wanted to do

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.680 
like that I really wanted to do
photojournalism<00:04:16.130> because<00:04:16.579> I'm<00:04:16.970> very<00:04:17.450> very

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
photojournalism because I'm very very

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.840 
photojournalism because I'm very very
passionate<00:04:17.930> about<00:04:18.290> photography<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:19.280> I

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
passionate about photography and I

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.030 
passionate about photography and I
really<00:04:20.269> wanted<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.600> be<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.109> photographer<00:04:21.320> and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
really wanted to be a photographer and

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.190 
really wanted to be a photographer and
then<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.180> wanted<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.510> do<00:04:23.810> advertising

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
then I really wanted to do advertising

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.120 
then I really wanted to do advertising
because<00:04:25.480> photojournalism<00:04:26.480> by<00:04:26.690> itself<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.320> a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
because photojournalism by itself is a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.880 
because photojournalism by itself is a
major<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.330> mean<00:04:30.169> let's<00:04:30.320> be<00:04:30.410> honest<00:04:30.770> it's

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
major that I mean let's be honest it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.320 
major that I mean let's be honest it's
really<00:04:31.100> hard<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.340> get<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> job<00:04:31.760> with<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
really hard to get a job with just a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.780 
really hard to get a job with just a
photo<00:04:32.540> drop<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.900> some<00:04:33.020> degree<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.520> did

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
photo drop of some degree and so I did

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.580 
photo drop of some degree and so I did
advertising<00:04:35.390> kind<00:04:35.570> of<00:04:35.630> us<00:04:35.750> back<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.410> also

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
advertising kind of us back up and also

you're booking with clients in just the
way<00:06:06.200> you<00:06:06.260> may<00:06:06.710> be<00:06:06.770> right<00:06:07.340> on<00:06:07.370> your<00:06:07.550> blog<00:06:07.880> gives

way you may be right on your blog gives
to<00:06:08.390> share<00:06:08.570> your<00:06:08.690> personality<00:06:09.260> because<00:06:09.770> I

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
to share your personality because I

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.660 
to share your personality because I
think<00:06:10.120> sometimes<00:06:11.120> people<00:06:11.450> decide<00:06:12.380> on<00:06:12.980> things

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
think sometimes people decide on things

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.110 
think sometimes people decide on things
like<00:06:13.760> that

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
like that

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.960 
like that
based<00:06:14.600> on<00:06:14.840> just<00:06:15.410> if<00:06:16.280> they<00:06:16.460> like<00:06:16.640> you<00:06:16.820> or<00:06:16.850> not

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
based on just if they like you or not

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.850 
based on just if they like you or not
you<00:06:17.630> know<00:06:17.720> that's<00:06:17.870> how<00:06:18.110> life<00:06:18.290> or<00:06:18.530> if<00:06:18.590> someone's

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
you know that's how life or if someone's

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.250 
you know that's how life or if someone's
gonna<00:06:18.950> hire<00:06:19.190> you<00:06:19.340> may<00:06:19.490> don't<00:06:19.640> like<00:06:19.790> you<00:06:20.000> right

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
gonna hire you may don't like you right

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.450 
gonna hire you may don't like you right
so<00:06:21.260> I<00:06:21.290> think<00:06:21.530> one<00:06:21.860> of<00:06:21.890> the<00:06:21.980> most<00:06:22.130> important

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
so I think one of the most important

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.430 
so I think one of the most important
things<00:06:22.580> is<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.000> just<00:06:23.360> really<00:06:23.990> show<00:06:24.260> your

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
things is to just really show your

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.590 
things is to just really show your
personality<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:25.310> how<00:06:26.000> people<00:06:26.330> get<00:06:26.450> to<00:06:26.510> know

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
personality and how people get to know
