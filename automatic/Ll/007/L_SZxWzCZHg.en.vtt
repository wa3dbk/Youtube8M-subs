wheels<00:00:31.390> are<00:00:31.630> better<00:00:31.900> than<00:00:31.990> threads<00:00:32.320> we<00:00:32.650> need

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
wheels are better than threads we need

to<00:00:32.860> do<00:00:33.040> coke<00:00:33.219> test<00:00:33.629> first<00:00:34.629> off<00:00:34.930> why<00:00:35.260> don't<00:00:35.410> we

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
to do coke test first off why don't we

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.780 
to do coke test first off why don't we
try<00:00:35.680> it<00:00:35.710> by<00:00:35.860> testing<00:00:36.190> out<00:00:36.250> their<00:00:36.399> relative

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
try it by testing out their relative

speeds<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.480> can't<00:00:38.140> think<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.379> any<00:00:38.649> reason<00:00:39.039> why

tank<00:00:39.460> treads<00:00:39.670> are<00:00:39.789> slower<00:00:40.030> than<00:00:40.120> wheels<00:00:40.510> and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
tank treads are slower than wheels and

tank treads are slower than wheels and
driving<00:00:41.289> in<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.440> straight<00:00:41.590> line<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.850> sounds

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
driving in a straight line this sounds

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.209 
driving in a straight line this sounds
like<00:00:43.270> just<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:43.660> thing<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:43.840> need<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.170> test<00:00:44.320> out

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.250 

it's<00:00:48.219> time<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.850> head<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.390> lab<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.989> see

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
it's time to head to the lab and see

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.439 
it's time to head to the lab and see
whether<00:00:50.500> or<00:00:50.620> not<00:00:50.770> wheels<00:00:51.219> are<00:00:51.610> better<00:00:52.090> than

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
whether or not wheels are better than

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.299 
whether or not wheels are better than
tank<00:00:52.690> trips<00:00:52.960> okay<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.800> we<00:00:53.890> build<00:00:54.100> our<00:00:54.190> two

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
tank trips okay so we build our two

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.459 
tank trips okay so we build our two
robots<00:00:54.699> we<00:00:54.940> have<00:00:55.030> our<00:00:55.210> robot<00:00:55.539> with<00:00:55.780> wheels<00:00:56.079> and

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
robots we have our robot with wheels and

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.950 
robots we have our robot with wheels and
a<00:00:56.530> robot<00:00:56.920> with<00:00:57.129> treads<00:00:57.430> we've<00:00:58.359> also<00:00:58.780> laid<00:00:58.930> out

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
a robot with treads we've also laid out

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.930 
a robot with treads we've also laid out
a<00:00:59.109> set<00:00:59.379> distance<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.309> compare<00:01:00.730> their

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
a set distance so we can compare their

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:11.600 
a set distance so we can compare their
speeds<00:01:01.210> side-by-side

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.280 

and<00:01:12.610> stop<00:01:15.990> Wow

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and stop Wow

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.810 
and stop Wow
tank<00:01:17.530> treads<00:01:17.770> are<00:01:17.890> definitely<00:01:18.340> slower<00:01:18.580> than

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
tank treads are definitely slower than

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.670 
tank treads are definitely slower than
the<00:01:18.910> wheels<00:01:19.150> my<00:01:19.870> guess<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.440> there's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
the wheels my guess is that there's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.940 
the wheels my guess is that there's
extra<00:01:21.040> friction<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.640> tank<00:01:21.880> tread<00:01:22.120> system

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
extra friction in a tank tread system

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
extra friction in a tank tread system
here<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.100> let<00:01:24.190> me<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.310> take<00:01:24.700> out<00:01:24.910> this<00:01:25.180> shaft

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.810 

whoa<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.530> clue<00:01:29.830> he<00:01:30.040> doesn't<00:01:30.310> move<00:01:30.400> as<00:01:30.550> easily

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
whoa this clue he doesn't move as easily

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.080 
whoa this clue he doesn't move as easily
as<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.240> wheels<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.490> what<00:01:36.610> do<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.850> Jamie

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
as the wheels so what do you say Jamie

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.000 
as the wheels so what do you say Jamie
tank<00:01:37.570> treads<00:01:37.810> make<00:01:37.990> your<00:01:38.170> robot<00:01:38.470> slower<00:01:38.770> when

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
tank treads make your robot slower when

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.260 
tank treads make your robot slower when
driving<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.430> straight<00:01:39.670> line

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
driving in a straight line

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
driving in a straight line
confirmed<00:01:41.130> yep<00:01:42.130> I'd<00:01:42.550> say<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:42.940> confirmed

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.560 

but<00:01:47.290> wait<00:01:47.470> hang<00:01:47.800> on<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.979> second<00:01:48.460> hang<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.790> but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
but wait hang on a second hang on but

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.030 
but wait hang on a second hang on but
we're<00:01:49.720> trying<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.990> say<00:01:50.140> wheels<00:01:50.380> are<00:01:50.619> better

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
we're trying to say wheels are better

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370 
we're trying to say wheels are better
than<00:01:51.430> tank<00:01:51.729> treads<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.750> even<00:01:52.990> though<00:01:53.080> tank

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
than tank treads so even though tank

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.780 
than tank treads so even though tank
treads<00:01:53.590> drive<00:01:53.800> in<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.979> straight<00:01:54.040> line<00:01:54.400> slower

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
treads drive in a straight line slower

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.700 
treads drive in a straight line slower
than<00:01:55.119> wheels<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.600> still<00:01:56.140> think<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:56.470> they

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
than wheels I still think that they

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.810 
than wheels I still think that they
might<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:56.920> better<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.280> driving<00:01:57.610> over

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
might be better at driving over

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.060 
might be better at driving over
obstacles<00:01:58.540> because<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.680> there's<00:01:59.860> more

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
obstacles because of there's more

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.130 
obstacles because of there's more
surface<00:02:00.399> area<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:01.030> contact<00:02:01.060> with<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> grounds

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
surface area in contact with the grounds

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.130 
surface area in contact with the grounds
and<00:02:02.259> objects<00:02:02.890> at<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.190> times<00:02:03.490> for<00:02:03.820> instance<00:02:04.540> we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
and objects at all times for instance we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.600 
and objects at all times for instance we
can<00:02:05.290> test<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.619> base<00:02:05.770> driving<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.369> SAC

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
can test the base driving of the SAC

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.340 
can test the base driving of the SAC
from<00:02:06.880> last<00:02:07.090> year's<00:02:07.300> game<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.899> bump<00:02:08.140> from

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
from last year's game and the bump from

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.859 
from last year's game and the bump from
this<00:02:08.560> year's<00:02:08.800> game<00:02:09.090> sounds<00:02:10.090> reasonable<00:02:10.209> let's

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
this year's game sounds reasonable let's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:35.300 
this year's game sounds reasonable let's
test<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.350> out<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:14.950> go

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.300 

so<00:02:36.310> wheels<00:02:36.880> Barrentine<00:02:37.570> creds<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.170> say<00:02:38.800> busted

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
so wheels Barrentine creds I say busted

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.710 
so wheels Barrentine creds I say busted
definitely<00:02:40.240> busted

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
definitely busted

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.630 
definitely busted
while<00:02:41.230> tank<00:02:41.710> treads<00:02:41.950> gonna<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.310> slower<00:02:42.520> than

wheels<00:02:43.060> from<00:02:43.300> driving<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> straight<00:02:43.780> line

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
wheels from driving in a straight line

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.050 
wheels from driving in a straight line
the<00:02:44.620> treads<00:02:44.980> are<00:02:45.160> still<00:02:45.400> better<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.730> going

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the treads are still better for going

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060 
the treads are still better for going
over<00:02:46.150> obstacles<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.290> can't<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.830> say

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
over obstacles so you can't really say

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.290 
over obstacles so you can't really say
that<00:02:48.100> one<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.520> better<00:02:48.670> than<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> other<00:02:49.060> or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
that one is better than the other or

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.330 
that one is better than the other or
vice<00:02:49.330> versa<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.740> depends<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
vice versa it really depends on the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.030 
vice versa it really depends on the
situation<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:52.060> they're<00:02:52.180> being<00:02:52.330> used<00:02:52.420> for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.880 

well<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.760> time<00:02:58.939> for<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.180> part<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.599> show

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
well it's time for this part of the show

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.990 
well it's time for this part of the show
do<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.980> want<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.220> do<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> honors

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
do you want to do the honors

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.659 
do you want to do the honors
definitely
