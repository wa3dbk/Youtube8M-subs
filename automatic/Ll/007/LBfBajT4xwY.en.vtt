00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.430 
loving everyone around you and she had
these<00:01:55.760> kind<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.060> personal<00:01:56.540> issues<00:01:57.050> with<00:01:57.080> her

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
these kind of personal issues with her

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.770 
these kind of personal issues with her
appearance<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.790> think<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.270> she<00:01:59.510> knew<00:01:59.630> in

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
appearance and I think that she knew in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.750 
appearance and I think that she knew in
order<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.170> sort<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.410> move<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.340> create

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
order to sort of move on and to create

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.130 
order to sort of move on and to create
the<00:02:01.970> music<00:02:02.270> she<00:02:02.390> wanted<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.750> create<00:02:02.930> she

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
the music she wanted to create she

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.770 
the music she wanted to create she
needed<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.740> take<00:02:03.950> care<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.190> herself<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:05.150> she

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
needed to take care of herself so she

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.620 
needed to take care of herself so she
cancelled<00:02:06.500> her<00:02:06.590> spring<00:02:06.920> tour<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.550> she<00:02:08.450> went

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
cancelled her spring tour and she went

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.820 
cancelled her spring tour and she went
into<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.869> treatment<00:02:09.200> program

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.960 

told<00:02:14.830> me<00:02:14.920> she<00:02:15.040> will<00:02:15.129> always<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.760> little

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
told me she will always be a little

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.420 
told me she will always be a little
crazy<00:02:16.239> but<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.690> seems<00:02:16.900> like<00:02:17.110> she<00:02:17.379> possibly<00:02:17.950> may

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
crazy but it seems like she possibly may

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.790 
crazy but it seems like she possibly may
be<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.760> into<00:02:18.849> more<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> rock<00:02:19.720> vibe<00:02:19.959> such

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
be going into more like a rock vibe such

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.559 
be going into more like a rock vibe such
as<00:02:20.980> listening<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.459> lot<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.790> feet<00:02:22.239> with<00:02:22.360> Mack

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
as listening to a lot of feet with Mack

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.119 
as listening to a lot of feet with Mack
waiting<00:02:23.110> she<00:02:23.230> was<00:02:23.349> in<00:02:23.470> treatment<00:02:23.830> she<00:02:24.010> had<00:02:24.040> a

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
waiting she was in treatment she had a

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.300 
waiting she was in treatment she had a
toy<00:02:24.430> Casio<00:02:25.209> keyboard<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.170> she<00:02:26.530> wrote<00:02:26.739> 14

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
toy Casio keyboard that she wrote 14

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.520 
toy Casio keyboard that she wrote 14
songs<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.300> she's<00:02:28.810> having<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.200> sort<00:02:29.440> of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
songs with so she's having this sort of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.229 
songs with so she's having this sort of
like<00:02:29.680> artistic<00:02:30.040> Epiphany<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.790> think<00:02:31.060> at<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
like artistic Epiphany I think at the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.030 
like artistic Epiphany I think at the
same<00:02:31.390> time<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.840> taking<00:02:32.080> care<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.440> herself<00:02:32.590> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
same time of taking care of herself and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.759 
same time of taking care of herself and
all<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.519> seems<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> coincide<00:02:34.450> with

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
all of this seems to coincide with

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.190 
all of this seems to coincide with
herself<00:02:35.769> style-wise<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.930> know<00:02:38.050> this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
herself style-wise because you know this

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.509 
herself style-wise because you know this
is<00:02:38.349> somebody<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.799> was<00:02:38.890> sort<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.069> known<00:02:39.280> for

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
is somebody that was sort of known for

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.729 
is somebody that was sort of known for
their<00:02:39.640> garbage<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.450> glam<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:41.049> grind<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.440> Sheik

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
their garbage is glam or grind the Sheik

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.410 
their garbage is glam or grind the Sheik
there's<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> time<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.760> place<00:02:42.790> for<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
there's a time and a place for that and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.490 
there's a time and a place for that and
I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.840> that's<00:02:43.959> what<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.319> really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I think that that's what this really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
I think that that's what this really
made<00:02:44.799> her<00:02:45.010> who<00:02:45.190> she<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:46.120> right<00:02:46.360> now<00:02:46.540> her

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
made her who she is but right now her

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.050 
made her who she is but right now her
sort<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.380> fashion<00:02:47.739> risk<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.430> show<00:02:48.580> up<00:02:48.819> at<00:02:48.970> an
