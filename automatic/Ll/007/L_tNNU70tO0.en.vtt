on<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.250> gas<00:01:52.459> at<00:01:52.969> all<00:01:53.179> on<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.539> way<00:01:53.629> out<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
on the gas at all on the way out of the

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.839 
on the gas at all on the way out of the
corner<00:01:54.289> you'll<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.709> waiting<00:01:54.890> for<00:01:55.789> the

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
corner you'll just be waiting for the

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.619 
corner you'll just be waiting for the
front<00:01:56.060> end<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.170> always<00:01:57.799> try<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.239> the<00:01:59.420> end

00:01:59.619 --> 00:01:59.629 
front end so always try and get the end

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:05.780 
front end so always try and get the end
of<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.840> curb<00:02:00.049> here<00:02:00.259> on<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.500> right

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.540 

I<00:02:05.960> found<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> best<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.470> break<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:08.369> this

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I found the best way to break for this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510 
I found the best way to break for this
corner<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.570> turn<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> you're<00:02:11.130> pointing

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
corner is to turn so you're pointing

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.750 
corner is to turn so you're pointing
towards<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.910> apex<00:02:12.360> which<00:02:13.110> I've<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.320> done

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
towards the apex which I've just done

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.640 
towards the apex which I've just done
where<00:02:14.760> we've<00:02:14.910> pause<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.270> video<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.720> then

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
where we've pause the video and then

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.170 
where we've pause the video and then
breaking<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.220> straight<00:02:17.490> line<00:02:17.700> heading

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
breaking a straight line heading

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.480 
breaking a straight line heading
straight<00:02:18.450> towards<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> apex<00:02:19.260> I've<00:02:20.190> tried<00:02:20.400> two

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
straight towards the apex I've tried two

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.890 
straight towards the apex I've tried two
different<00:02:20.520> ways<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.510> seems<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> be

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
different ways and this just seems to be

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.230 
different ways and this just seems to be
the<00:02:22.080> most<00:02:22.230> consistent<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:23.070> me<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.430> generally

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
the most consistent for me and generally

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.950 
the most consistent for me and generally
a<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.720> faster<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.260> well<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.750> third

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
a bit faster as well so I'm in third

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.590 
a bit faster as well so I'm in third
gear<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.790> stay<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.330> third<00:02:30.570> through

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
gear here and I stay in third through

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.740 
gear here and I stay in third through
this<00:02:31.020> whole<00:02:31.350> next<00:02:31.530> section<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.180> key<00:02:33.450> out

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
this whole next section and the key out

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.450 
this whole next section and the key out
of<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.230> next<00:02:34.560> three<00:02:34.590> corners<00:02:35.160> we've<00:02:35.340> got

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
of these next three corners we've got

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.040 
of these next three corners we've got
the<00:02:35.640> two<00:02:35.970> right-handers<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the two right-handers and then the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.280 
the two right-handers and then the
left-hander<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.520> key<00:02:38.730> corner<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.810> those<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
left-hander the key corner for those is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.600 
left-hander the key corner for those is
the<00:02:40.320> last<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.100> that's<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.520> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the last one because that's the one that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.820 
the last one because that's the one that
leads<00:02:41.760> onto<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.120> straight<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.709> you

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
leads onto a straight and then if you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.620 
leads onto a straight and then if you
can<00:02:44.010> carry<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.610> speed<00:02:44.760> onto<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.240> straight

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
can carry more speed onto that straight

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.660 
can carry more speed onto that straight
then<00:02:46.470> you're<00:02:46.620> going<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> gain<00:02:47.070> time<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
then you're going to gain time all the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.160 
then you're going to gain time all the
way<00:02:47.760> down<00:02:47.940> there<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.480> these<00:02:48.840> two

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
way down there so these two

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.890 
way down there so these two
right-handers<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:50.340> all<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.240> for<00:02:51.510> set<00:02:51.690> up

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
right-handers are all really for set up

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.680 
right-handers are all really for set up
for<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> left-hander<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.120> use<00:02:57.390> all

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
for the left-hander so you can use all

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.410 
for the left-hander so you can use all
the<00:02:57.750> curb<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> second<00:02:58.980> right-hander

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the curb on the second right-hander

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.250 
the curb on the second right-hander
sometimes<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.540> come<00:03:00.690> through<00:03:00.900> here<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.170> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
sometimes I come through here and it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.100 
sometimes I come through here and it
just<00:03:01.440> feels<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.160> slow<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.360> think<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.690> must<00:03:03.930> be

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
just feels so slow and I think I must be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.630 
just feels so slow and I think I must be
able<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.320> carry<00:03:04.470> more<00:03:04.680> speed<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:05.280> then<00:03:05.459> when<00:03:05.610> I

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
able to carry more speed but then when I

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.210 
able to carry more speed but then when I
do<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.440> wide<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.040> not

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
do you know going wide and I'm not

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.380 
do you know going wide and I'm not
getting<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.580> good<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> line<00:03:09.090> into<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
getting as good a line into the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
getting as good a line into the
left-hander<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.170> really<00:03:10.530> are<00:03:10.650> giving<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
left-hander so you really are giving it

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.400 
left-hander so you really are giving it
up<00:03:11.280> here<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.420> improve<00:03:12.810> your<00:03:12.870> speed<00:03:13.140> through

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
up here to improve your speed through

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.170 
up here to improve your speed through
the<00:03:13.500> next<00:03:13.680> turn<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:13.920> onto<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> straight

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.070 

another<00:03:18.180> thing<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.510> mention<00:03:18.660> here<00:03:19.050> is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
another thing to mention here is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.350 
another thing to mention here is
applying<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.890> throttle<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.459> could<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.090> fully

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
applying the throttle I could be fully

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.750 
applying the throttle I could be fully
on<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.600> gas<00:03:21.900> at<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.500> point<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.580> this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
on the gas at this point but with this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.690 
on the gas at this point but with this
setup<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.299> find<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.959> I'm<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.950> gas<00:03:26.130> really

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
setup I find if I'm on the gas really

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940 
setup I find if I'm on the gas really
early<00:03:27.030> often<00:03:27.930> by<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.110> end<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> corner<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
early often by the end of the corner the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460 
early often by the end of the corner the
front<00:03:29.190> end<00:03:29.400> starting<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.209> run<00:03:30.420> wide<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.959> then

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
front end starting to run wide and then

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.190 
front end starting to run wide and then
I<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.739> lift<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:33.060> really<00:03:33.570> want<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.840> lift

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
I have to lift and I really want to lift

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.979 
I have to lift and I really want to lift
early<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> corner<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.750> set<00:03:36.959> up

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
early in the corner really get set up

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.530 
early in the corner really get set up
and<00:03:37.350> then<00:03:37.470> get<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.950> gas<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.430> stay<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.970> it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.869 

so<00:03:46.230> I'm<00:03:46.530> getting<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> brakes<00:03:47.219> around<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
so I'm getting on the brakes around the

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.479 
so I'm getting on the brakes around the
50<00:03:48.180> marker<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.719> shifting<00:03:49.709> down<00:03:49.859> from<00:03:50.159> fourth

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
50 marker and shifting down from fourth

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.839 
50 marker and shifting down from fourth
to<00:03:50.849> second<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> I've<00:03:55.799> made<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.099> into<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.519> apex

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
to second so I've made it into my apex

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.789 
to second so I've made it into my apex
one<00:03:57.599> thing<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.810> consider<00:03:58.019> here<00:03:58.469> is<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.709> don't

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
one thing to consider here is you don't

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.160 
one thing to consider here is you don't
want<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.099> go<00:03:59.280> all<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.760> way<00:04:00.150> out<00:04:00.269> on<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.780> accent

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
want to go all the way out on the accent

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.380 
want to go all the way out on the accent
again<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:02.120> corner<00:04:03.120> where<00:04:03.269> you're

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
again this is a corner where you're

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.750 
again this is a corner where you're
giving<00:04:03.659> up<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:03.810> line<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.530> speed<00:04:05.489> through

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
giving up your line and speed through

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.629 
giving up your line and speed through
this<00:04:05.909> one<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.450> help<00:04:06.689> you<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> next<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:10.639> and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
this one to help you in the next one and

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.039 
this one to help you in the next one and
see<00:04:11.849> our<00:04:11.879> most<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.510> way<00:04:12.629> over<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.989> left

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
see our most of the way over to the left

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.080 
see our most of the way over to the left
of<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.439> track<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.459> never<00:04:14.639> all<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.000> way

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
of the track here and never all the way

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.490 
of the track here and never all the way
over<00:04:15.359> because<00:04:15.540> that's<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.989> lot<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.229> extra

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
over because that's just a lot of extra

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.699 
over because that's just a lot of extra
distance<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.299> also<00:04:18.299> you're<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.750> open

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
distance and also you're going to open

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.409 
distance and also you're going to open
people<00:04:20.009> up<00:04:20.099> to<00:04:20.340> dive<00:04:20.639> bombing<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.120> down<00:04:21.269> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
inside here so I just a lift and turn in

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.330 
inside here so I just a lift and turn in
for<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.449> one<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.919> try<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:25.979> throw<00:04:26.130> my<00:04:26.310> apex

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
for this one and try and throw my apex

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.730 
for this one and try and throw my apex
there<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.880> found<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> yeah<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:31.110> big<00:04:31.500> thing

fought along the exit and depending on

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.100 
fought along the exit and depending on
your<00:04:37.320> set<00:04:37.530> again<00:04:37.830> it's<00:04:38.160> really<00:04:38.490> easy<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.849> get

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
your set again it's really easy to get

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.050 
your set again it's really easy to get
understeer<00:04:40.110> or<00:04:40.169> oversteer<00:04:40.349> able<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.430> one<00:04:41.639> so

understeer or oversteer able this one so
I'm<00:04:42.360> not<00:04:42.599> full<00:04:43.139> on<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.440> throttle<00:04:43.590> all<00:04:43.889> that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
I'm not full on the throttle all that

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.580 
I'm not full on the throttle all that
early<00:04:44.400> really<00:04:45.240> modulating<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.930> all<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.470> way

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590

to<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.889> exit

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.480 

and<00:04:53.630> turning<00:04:54.139> into<00:04:54.229> this<00:04:54.470> one<00:04:54.740> just<00:04:55.130> as<00:04:55.310> we've

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
and turning into this one just as we've

the<00:04:58.460> left<00:04:58.729> of<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.060> track<00:04:59.270> behind<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.660> fence<00:04:59.900> I

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
the left of the track behind the fence I

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.290 
the left of the track behind the fence I
take<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:00.710> corner<00:05:00.979> in<00:05:01.160> third<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.760> then<00:05:01.970> after

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
take this corner in third and then after

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.680 
take this corner in third and then after
the<00:05:02.389> corner<00:05:02.660> when<00:05:02.750> stay<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.080> third<00:05:03.290> as<00:05:03.500> well<00:05:04.690> so

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
the corner when stay in third as well so

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.530 
the corner when stay in third as well so
just<00:05:05.720> made<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.169> slight<00:05:06.500> lift<00:05:07.120> as<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.240> come<00:05:08.419> into

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
just made a slight lift as you come into

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.080 
just made a slight lift as you come into
the<00:05:08.780> apex<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.949> curb<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.340> can<00:05:10.490> use<00:05:10.639> all<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:11.000> it

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
the apex this curb you can use all of it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.320 
the apex this curb you can use all of it
but<00:05:11.510> don't<00:05:12.139> go<00:05:12.410> more<00:05:13.160> than<00:05:13.220> all<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:13.699> if<00:05:14.060> that

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
but don't go more than all of it if that

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.240 
but don't go more than all of it if that
makes<00:05:14.479> any<00:05:14.570> sense<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:15.530> put<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.949> inside

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
makes any sense if you put the inside

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.920 
makes any sense if you put the inside
wheel<00:05:16.490> off<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:16.880> inside<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.449> curb<00:05:17.660> that's

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
wheel off the inside of the curb that's

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.659 
wheel off the inside of the curb that's
quite<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.139> sharp<00:05:18.440> drop<00:05:18.650> there<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.100> it's<00:05:19.430> really

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
quite a sharp drop there and it's really

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.280 
quite a sharp drop there and it's really
easy<00:05:19.970> to<00:05:20.090> get<00:05:20.360> out<00:05:20.479> of<00:05:20.510> shape<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:23.990> stain

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
easy to get out of shape so I stain

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.680 
easy to get out of shape so I stain
third<00:05:24.620> as<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:24.979> mentioned<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:26.150> quick<00:05:26.389> stamp

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
third as I mentioned and a quick stamp

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.439 
third as I mentioned and a quick stamp
of<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.870> brakes<00:05:27.139> as<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.680> turn<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.130> this<00:05:29.060> is<00:05:29.240> more

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
of the brakes as I turn in this is more

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.450 
of the brakes as I turn in this is more
to<00:05:29.750> load<00:05:29.900> up<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.139> front<00:05:30.380> end<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.680> car<00:05:30.770> than

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
to load up the front end of the car than

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.129 
to load up the front end of the car than
to<00:05:31.729> slow<00:05:31.940> down<00:05:32.150> as<00:05:32.389> I've<00:05:32.539> mentioned<00:05:32.570> in<00:05:33.050> the

to slow down as I've mentioned in the

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.240 
to slow down as I've mentioned in the
previous<00:05:33.350> video<00:05:35.470> into<00:05:36.470> your<00:05:36.560> apex<00:05:36.860> here<00:05:37.160> you
