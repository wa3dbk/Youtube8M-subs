00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 [Music] 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.910
 I knew that according to article 3 of the law 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.469
 19,279 if you have a disability 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.160
 You have the right to acquire a motor vehicle 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.439
 National without paying taxes or imported into 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.320
 value of your country of origin without paying 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.320
 taxes you knew good or I do not know about you 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.080
 good talking about rights now also 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.720
 we have rights and others 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.490
 different rights we are celebrating the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.930
 regulation of the celiac law and 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.980
 we are learning what is the most 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.390
 important 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.700
 what is the proper nutrition 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.530
 taking into account that a free diet 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.270
 of gluten is the only treatment 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.430
 possible for those of us who are elía 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.470
 things we had said and we had 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.290
 pointed out what red obviously what 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.600
 it is absolutely forbidden and good and 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.030
 now I want to highlight what really 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.489
 is freely allowed we are not going to go to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.080
 green please this I want to highlight that 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.989
 these foods that because of their composition 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.600
 natural chemistry do not have just 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.610
 those toxic proteins that we talked about 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.100
 a little while ago and these 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.540
 foods really are many and they are the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 basis of healthy eating 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.970
 because the celiac can consume all 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 the fruits all the vegetables all 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.120
 type of liquid milk meats egg 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.700
 dried fruits and oils 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.280
 then the basic food is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.979
 absolutely covered the healthy 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.290
 but what is then the prevention of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.810
 the green that is not contaminated because a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 food that is naturally allowed 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.369
 if it was not well handled it will be 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.160
 polluted with products that if they are 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.440
 Toxic takes out a big spotlight 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.140
 there is no then yes we are going to move 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.820
 a little more in the center of the table for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 really see all this that has to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.320
 see nothing more or nothing less than with 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 industrialization because of the hand of 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 industrialization are these these 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.860
 alerts that the patient has to have 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 with food contamination to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 starting point of that wheat flour 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.920
 which is so used by all 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 positive effects on 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.500
 industrialization of wheat flour 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.560
 has then yes or yes the celiac has 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.900
 have to check the food in your 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.459
 composition if it has gluten or does not have 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 no have for that there are analyzes 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.470
 special specials are referred to 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 special laboratories so that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.730
 really do the analysis 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 of the products or that list that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.600
 we have the celiac products 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.660
 allowed and not allowed beyond 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.240
 stamp indicates that they were analyzed by 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.250
 a laboratory to see how much of 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.260
 gluten had and if it is tolerable by 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.030
 one sick already 40 and then up 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.550
 now the law is very cool 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.920
 then please continue to respect that 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.380
 you have to go to those listings do not look 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.810
 containers are not yet guided by containers 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.110
 We'll see how this goes after I do not know 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.180
 reads in containers and goes to listings 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.580
 food allowances allowed 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.360
 first advice then they are breathing 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 strong here 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.489
 well then because it's important 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.709
 when we do the surveys of 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.450
 adherence generally of these 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.700
 patients of so many years what is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.069
 they start out there sometimes to relax the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.959
 efforts then what is going on 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.819
 this one starts asking and there's 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.819
 little things that the patient has left 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.459
 looking like saying and that too and if 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.580
 that too and what are those foods 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:39.780
 that in so many years I have detected 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:53.400
 my brother's face was also 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:55.690
 eating that too but some things 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.710
 so for example what are those 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.050
 imperceptible foods the infusions 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.750
 really the infusions let's talk about teas 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.940
 of yerba mate in our country that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.890
 they have to be analyzed because in the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.890
 drying of these leaves many times 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.000
 uses wheat flour other foods 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.310
 are the gypsies not something that 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.080
 supposedly it's as innocuous as the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.940
 yerba mate that we use all the 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.310
 days and the local 2 for example also 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.590
 there are very few broths allowed a single 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.140
 the best or 'the pretty but this 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.600
 really that's what you have to check it 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.970
 then sometimes it 's master the example go to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.100
 the house of a relative and as you know that 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.050
 they are celiac prepared a meat to them 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.870
 oven 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.770
 with potatoes that make you eat or not eat and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.800
 If not, you have to ask first how 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.060
 was made we produce leaving the meat 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.060
 when the prices of baked 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.490
 thanks for all the effort but everything 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.750
 delete exactly and the other point of 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.720
 inflection there are the condiments 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.190
 pains and condiments also have 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.430
 to be checked for that are there at 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.560
 in front of the table the mustards in the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.580
 region is to right all the dressings 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.819
 that we use them both industrialized 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.159
 kind of not being to close andreite 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.900
 asked the subject of the utensils of 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.400
 the crockery glasses we're not going 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.219
 we go because to see important advice 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.419
 you have to take care of yourself but you do not have to fall 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.969
 obsessions 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.889
 and less please apocalyptic messages 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.020
 touch you have to preserve the quality of 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.509
 life of the celiac then there are things that 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.099
 they are real and things that do not need the 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.229
 skin does not have to have a crockery 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.790
 apart that you have to do a good 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.740
 hygiene in the house 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.050
 of the tableware that is shared with all 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.900
 if it really is because there's a toaster that 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.380
 is used a lot would be let's say well 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.760
 seen having two tasters per ndong to 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.650
 all the rest of my family uses the 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.680
 automatic toaster and I have the 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.210
 old classic of our times back 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.920
 it is put on the stove that way 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.020
 You can even go through water and milk 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.030
 or the rejection of all then first 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.610
 cook the food of coeliacs 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.260
 then cook the other foods that 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.330
 they have ariel to clean the countertops well 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.180
 first frying celiac milanesas 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.530
 and then rules and for example in the 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.910
 oven can be used us 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.100
 you can calmly put in the same 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.710
 oven a pick will be with a pizza without 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.630
 gluten and a pizza with gluten or like 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.370
 I say the pizzas do not come alive and 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.470
 they explode and jump from one side to the other 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.870
 then this is what I ask for 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.490
 please common sense because if not the 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.800
 quality of life in the social of a 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.540
 celiac becomes unsustainable obvious good 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.010
 I do not know in your house if they do not come alive in the 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.780
 mine if you do not know the life you have in 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.000
 serious 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.370
 well we make a small break in a 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.810
 We will be talking about data 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.920
 precise what the doctor is going to give us 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.120
 guevara that has to do with the 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.970
 number of celiacs 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.600
 argentina and with the amount of people 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.090
 who are celiac and still do not know and 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.919
 we will also be enjoying mónica 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:01.199
 Monica silvia forgiveness is good but for 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.760
 please say line that is a mom with 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.889
 four celiac children that has been dedicated 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.199
 to the celiac kitchen that is a genius and 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.240
 will teach us how to do something 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.340
 simple at home to enjoy and 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.199
 get us that fret face that out there 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.370
 we have because there is nothing to eat 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.430
 we pause we are back ni 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.020
 lie wise you want to finish your 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.940
 retirement procedure you can choose from 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.070
 immediate a social work if you do not want 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.900
 remain in peace the beneficiaries who 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.270
 they retire they receive with their family group 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.100
 primary medical benefits of the 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.260
 social work in which they were 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:45.420
 for 90 days 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:45.420
