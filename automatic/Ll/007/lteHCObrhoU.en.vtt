00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
let's see if some other app maybe may be

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.950 
let's see if some other app maybe may be
causing<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.960> there's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
causing this and as you can see there's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
causing this and as you can see there's
this<00:01:58.350> screen<00:01:58.770> bubble<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.399> none<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> icons

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
here have a X mark on it this means that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.380 
here have a X mark on it this means that
there<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> no<00:02:04.200> other<00:02:04.470> app<00:02:05.119> apart<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
there is no other app apart from the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.729 
there is no other app apart from the
stock<00:02:06.770> by<00:02:07.770> us<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:09.420> song<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:10.019> absolutely

nothing

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.880 
nothing
so<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:15.390> thought<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.200> could<00:02:16.769> have

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
so the thought that I could have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 
so the thought that I could have
installed<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.489> third-party<00:02:17.880> application

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
installed a third-party application

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.330 
installed a third-party application
which<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.200> causing<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:20.299> ruled<00:02:21.299> out<00:02:22.340> this

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
which is causing this is ruled out this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.789 
which is causing this is ruled out this
appears<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.820> be<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.060> hardware<00:02:24.480> issue<00:02:24.799> according

appears to be a hardware issue according

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.660 
appears to be a hardware issue according
to<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:27.450> Apple<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.110> refusing<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.430> accept

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
to me but Apple is refusing to accept
