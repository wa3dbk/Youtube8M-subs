itm cup and currie cup if you guys want
to<00:00:59.730> go<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> far<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.870> instead<00:01:01.350> they've<00:01:01.590> got

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
to go that far but instead they've got

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to go that far but instead they've got
customization<00:01:03.359> options<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
customization options where you can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.240 
customization options where you can
change<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> player<00:01:05.159> names<00:01:05.519> within<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.720> teams

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
change the player names within the teams

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
change the player names within the teams
so<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.580> seems<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> real

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so it seems like it actually is the real

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.030 
so it seems like it actually is the real
player<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
player they're not going to have the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.690 
player they're not going to have the
player<00:01:12.030> likenesses<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.159> least<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.580> know

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
player likenesses but at least you know

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800 
player likenesses but at least you know
that's<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> next<00:01:15.150> best<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's the next best thing and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
that's the next best thing and
unfortunately<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> logos

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
unfortunately they don't have the logos

unfortunately they don't have the logos
