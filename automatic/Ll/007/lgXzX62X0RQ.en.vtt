tubes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
tubes

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
tubes
yeah<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:22.290> motor<00:01:22.470> tubes<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.070> used<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
yeah the motor tubes that we used to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.050 
yeah the motor tubes that we used to
store<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.619> file<00:01:25.619> shells<00:01:25.950> before<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.940> actually

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
store the file shells before we actually

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
store the file shells before we actually
ignite<00:01:27.540> them<00:01:27.690> how<00:01:27.990> did<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> show<00:01:28.350> us<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> way

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
ignite them how did it show us the way

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.810 
ignite them how did it show us the way
like<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> say<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> shells<00:01:29.580> look<00:01:29.670> like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
like what you say the shells look like

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.620 
like what you say the shells look like
coconuts<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.050> switch<00:01:34.350> side<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.330> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
coconuts so we switch side up this is a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.540 
coconuts so we switch side up this is a
normal<00:01:40.140> photo<00:01:40.380> shell<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> lifting

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
normal photo shell this is the lifting

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.670 
normal photo shell this is the lifting
charge<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.750> makes<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
charge this is what actually makes the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.910 
charge this is what actually makes the
thing<00:01:45.590> normal<00:01:46.590> net<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.369> oh

it has a match it
Oh<00:01:53.940> once<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.200> press<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> computer<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
Oh once we press the computer it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
Oh once we press the computer it
actually<00:01:57.720> makes<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.800> electrically

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
actually makes this thing electrically

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.740 
actually makes this thing electrically
ah<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> show<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.310> net

that's the policy so you can actually
ignite<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.610> using<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.620> garage<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:19.019> this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
ignite this using a garage so this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.100 
ignite this using a garage so this
actually<00:02:19.860> goes<00:02:20.040> into<00:02:26.360> all<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.660> will<00:02:27.989> be

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.130 
oh and wire to the firing continues
which<00:03:03.920> will<00:03:04.070> be<00:03:04.160> at<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.340> back<00:03:04.520> but<00:03:05.240> they<00:03:06.050> will

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
which will be at the back but they will

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800 
which will be at the back but they will
be<00:03:06.200> sending<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.650> signal<00:03:06.830> from<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.640> exponent<00:03:08.120> so

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
be sending a signal from the exponent so

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.330 
be sending a signal from the exponent so
we'll<00:03:08.959> be<00:03:09.110> picking<00:03:09.260> up<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.680> signal<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.310> a

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
we'll be picking up that signal to a

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.370 
we'll be picking up that signal to a
wireless<00:03:10.880> device<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.870> name<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
wireless device this is the name of the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.350 
wireless device this is the name of the
effect<00:03:12.680> zoom<00:03:12.920> silver<00:03:13.430> camera

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
effect zoom silver camera

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.240 
effect zoom silver camera
so<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:14.930> different<00:03:15.380> one<00:03:15.500> should<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.739> go<00:03:16.040> yeah

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
so this different one should it go yeah

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.640 
so this different one should it go yeah
basically<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.930> lot<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.200> different

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
basically you see a lot of different

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:41.339 
basically you see a lot of different
designs<00:03:21.430> how<00:03:22.430> high<00:03:22.640> does<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.880> go

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.280
