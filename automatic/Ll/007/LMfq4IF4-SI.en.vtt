00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
okay so now let's talk about how to use

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.320 
okay so now let's talk about how to use
a<00:00:08.960> diffuser<00:00:09.380> it<00:00:09.710> is<00:00:09.950> so<00:00:10.280> simple<00:00:10.670> all<00:00:11.030> you<00:00:11.299> need

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
a diffuser it is so simple all you need

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.190 
a diffuser it is so simple all you need
to<00:00:11.629> do<00:00:11.809> is<00:00:12.309> remove<00:00:13.309> the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
to do is remove the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.040 
to do is remove the
traitor<00:00:14.620> inside<00:00:15.040> here<00:00:15.880> you<00:00:16.000> can<00:00:16.180> see<00:00:16.450> there<00:00:16.840> is

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
traitor inside here you can see there is

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.730 
traitor inside here you can see there is
the<00:00:17.290> nebulizer<00:00:17.710> head<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.910> vibrates

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the nebulizer head this vibrates

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650 
the nebulizer head this vibrates
ultrasonic<00:00:20.740> Li<00:00:20.890> at<00:00:21.070> such<00:00:21.460> a<00:00:21.490> high<00:00:21.970> rate<00:00:22.300> that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
ultrasonic Li at such a high rate that

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.540 
ultrasonic Li at such a high rate that
it<00:00:22.779> actually<00:00:22.990> breaks<00:00:23.439> up<00:00:23.740> water<00:00:23.950> molecules

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
it actually breaks up water molecules

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.580 
it actually breaks up water molecules
and<00:00:24.760> you're<00:00:25.390> gonna<00:00:25.510> see<00:00:25.750> them<00:00:25.930> in<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.080> moment<00:00:26.260> so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
and you're gonna see them in a moment so

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.249 
and you're gonna see them in a moment so
really<00:00:27.220> you<00:00:27.340> just<00:00:27.550> have<00:00:27.700> to<00:00:28.119> with<00:00:28.779> half<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.080> cup

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
really you just have to with half a cup

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.010 
really you just have to with half a cup
of<00:00:29.290> water<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.789> maybe<00:00:31.210> even<00:00:31.300> less<00:00:31.720> what<00:00:31.990> I

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
of water actually maybe even less what I

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.729 
of water actually maybe even less what I
like<00:00:32.260> to<00:00:32.349> do<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.830> I<00:00:33.129> go<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.080> tap<00:00:35.350> I

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
like to do is I go to the to the tap I

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.100 
like to do is I go to the to the tap I
put<00:00:36.280> my<00:00:36.400> finger<00:00:36.760> under<00:00:37.030> here<00:00:37.330> put<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.900> water

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
put my finger under here put the water

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.290 
put my finger under here put the water
in<00:00:38.320> there<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.770> just<00:00:38.949> drop<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.699> water<00:00:39.910> inside

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
in there and just drop the water inside

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.250 
in there and just drop the water inside
and<00:00:40.629> then<00:00:42.150> 10-15<00:00:43.150> drops<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.660> all<00:00:43.750> depends<00:00:44.230> how

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
and then 10-15 drops it all depends how

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.280 
and then 10-15 drops it all depends how
big<00:00:44.620> your<00:00:44.890> space<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.850> you'll<00:00:46.570> quickly<00:00:46.839> get

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
big your space is and you'll quickly get

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.259 
big your space is and you'll quickly get
the<00:00:47.440> hang<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.800> how<00:00:48.100> much<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.640> right<00:00:48.940> for<00:00:49.150> you

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
the hang of how much is right for you

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.630 
the hang of how much is right for you
make<00:00:49.600> sure<00:00:49.930> you're<00:00:50.350> not<00:00:50.500> putting<00:00:50.739> anything

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
make sure you're not putting anything

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.509 
make sure you're not putting anything
but<00:00:51.970> really<00:00:52.930> high<00:00:53.170> quality<00:00:53.229> essential<00:00:54.100> oils

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
but really high quality essential oils

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.610 
but really high quality essential oils
this<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.729> liquid<00:00:55.269> sunshine<00:00:55.540> one<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.530> my

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
this is liquid sunshine one of my

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.479 
this is liquid sunshine one of my
favorites<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.970> concentrator<00:00:58.600> goes<00:00:58.900> back<00:00:59.170> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
favorites the concentrator goes back on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539 
favorites the concentrator goes back on
then<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.699> top<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:02.019> get<00:01:02.290> your<00:01:02.589> power<00:01:03.010> supply

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
then the top you get your power supply

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.210 
then the top you get your power supply
at<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.059> back<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.600> here's<00:01:05.290> what<00:01:05.470> happens<00:01:05.860> when

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
at the back and here's what happens when

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.060 
at the back and here's what happens when
you<00:01:06.310> press<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.729> button<00:01:06.760> out<00:01:07.240> comes<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.619> cold

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
you press the button out comes this cold

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.969 
you press the button out comes this cold
steam<00:01:09.460> it's<00:01:09.700> actually<00:01:10.650> molecules<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.830> water

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
steam it's actually molecules of water

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.490 
steam it's actually molecules of water
that<00:01:12.220> are<00:01:12.369> going<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.580> humidify<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.540> air<00:01:13.900> but

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
that are going to humidify the air but

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.109 
that are going to humidify the air but
more<00:01:14.740> importantly<00:01:15.159> than<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.400> there's

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
more importantly than that there's

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.330 
more importantly than that there's
negative<00:01:16.659> ions<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.350> those<00:01:17.590> negative<00:01:18.010> ions

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
negative ions and those negative ions

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.760 
negative ions and those negative ions
will<00:01:18.640> bind<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.420> chemicals<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.500> there's

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
will bind to the chemicals and there's

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.209 
will bind to the chemicals and there's
over<00:01:21.090> 2,000<00:01:22.090> toxic<00:01:23.020> things<00:01:23.289> in<00:01:23.530> your<00:01:23.710> air<00:01:23.920> if

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
over 2,000 toxic things in your air if

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.340 
over 2,000 toxic things in your air if
you<00:01:24.369> live<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.729> city<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.210> when<00:01:25.840> they<00:01:26.049> bind

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
you live in a city and when they bind

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.410 
you live in a city and when they bind
they<00:01:26.619> become<00:01:26.920> heavier<00:01:27.369> than<00:01:27.729> air<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.060> they

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
they become heavier than air and they

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.450 
they become heavier than air and they
drop<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.020> ground<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.469> end<00:01:29.619> up<00:01:29.740> vacuuming

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
drop to the ground you end up vacuuming

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.749 
drop to the ground you end up vacuuming
them<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.359> that's<00:01:31.659> how<00:01:31.990> number<00:01:32.920> two<00:01:33.159> you're

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
them and so that's how number two you're

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.399 
them and so that's how number two you're
helping<00:01:34.299> your<00:01:34.450> health<00:01:34.630> by<00:01:34.840> taking<00:01:35.170> out<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
helping your health by taking out the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.770 
helping your health by taking out the
toxins<00:01:35.799> number<00:01:36.130> three<00:01:36.429> you're<00:01:36.969> infusing<00:01:37.539> your

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
toxins number three you're infusing your

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.349 
toxins number three you're infusing your
air<00:01:38.159> imagine<00:01:39.159> when<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.490> walk<00:01:39.700> into<00:01:39.909> forest

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
air imagine when you walk into forest

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.609 
air imagine when you walk into forest
have<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:40.570> ever<00:01:40.659> noticed<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.259> force

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
have you ever noticed that the force

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.010 
have you ever noticed that the force
seems<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.100> breathe<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:42.549> it's<00:01:42.700> like<00:01:43.020> you're

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
seems to breathe you it's like you're

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.810 
seems to breathe you it's like you're
taking<00:01:44.259> in<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:44.859> those<00:01:45.039> essential<00:01:45.369> oils<00:01:45.789> that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
taking in all those essential oils that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.160 
taking in all those essential oils that
are<00:01:45.909> coming<00:01:46.210> off<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.509> trees<00:01:46.719> what<00:01:46.899> this<00:01:47.049> is

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
are coming off the trees what this is

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.109 
are coming off the trees what this is
the<00:01:47.289> same<00:01:47.499> thing<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:48.009> causes<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.909> to

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
the same thing this causes you to
