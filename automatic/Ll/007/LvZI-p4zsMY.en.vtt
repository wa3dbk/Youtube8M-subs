00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.220
 yes okay if not I know it's stupid 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.619
 but produce something for everyone 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.309
 it makes sense to you though 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.989
 when you tell it, you figure the 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:36.199
 anyway tell me a little about goods for the 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.620
 role of sword sword and to such 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.550
 way if I could ask you a question 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.339
 because I don't understand her anymore 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.729
 motivation when he says mum's house but 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.800
 you are sure and the sword money came, yes 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.220
 knows that I thought planes came here for 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:59.119
 baby is my agency by the sword 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:02.409
 he said by the sword no because he is always 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:06.259
 the more children don't shoot, I see you 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.680
 that is, you are more a child , that is to say, even for 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.900
 baby but here I have had on the best 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.530
 hip hop and shoot that two die 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 apple, however, shoot it I feel more mine 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.270
 having tried anti I feel it more taste 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 nor by word and also let's say I see a lot 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.859
 closer to me physically moore e 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.579
 because but sword is one hardened by the 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:32.569
 life itself is already a man you are one more 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:36.469
 sensitive you are more child if one is you 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:38.630
 look and see you more child try I do 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.539
 the actor so maybe that is a 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.100
 character working a little step if 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.799
 I see you I see you a little more 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.810
 oh well then maybe we try both 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.729
 also baby but here is the announcement 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.079
 jokes because half remembering 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.619
 therefore only the sword is not ancient 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.659
 memory 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.850
 ok, quiet the law the thing 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.840
 we do reading right but I can 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.450
 take a minute there was a problem 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.450
 we make a law reads
