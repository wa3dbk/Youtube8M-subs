00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
said I'm about 98% because I heard it

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.810

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
we'll see but all I know is that I'm

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.430 
we'll see but all I know is that I'm
loving<00:03:26.170> them

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
loving them

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.190 
loving them
I<00:03:26.470> love<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.160> Jordan<00:03:27.550> 9<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.540> sneaker<00:03:29.020> that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
I love the Jordan 9 it's a sneaker that

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.260 
I love the Jordan 9 it's a sneaker that
I<00:03:29.470> didn't<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.460> when<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.640> was<00:03:30.820> young<00:03:31.090> I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
I didn't like it when I was young I

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.180 
I didn't like it when I was young I
think<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:31.720> because<00:03:31.840> Jordan<00:03:32.320> retired<00:03:32.770> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
think it was because Jordan retired and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.730 
think it was because Jordan retired and
I<00:03:33.670> felt<00:03:33.970> some<00:03:34.150> sort<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.450> way<00:03:34.510> about<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.930> but

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
I felt some sort of way about that but

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.320 
I felt some sort of way about that but
as<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.040> got<00:03:36.220> older<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.880> caught<00:03:37.120> my<00:03:37.300> first

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
as I got older and I caught my first

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.180 
as I got older and I caught my first
pair<00:03:37.840> threw<00:03:38.080> him<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.320> my<00:03:38.470> feet<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:38.800> was<00:03:39.040> like

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
