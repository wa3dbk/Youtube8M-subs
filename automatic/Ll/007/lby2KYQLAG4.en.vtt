I<00:01:50.880> came<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> day<00:01:51.570> before<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.050> race<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I came up to day before the race I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.999 
I came up to day before the race I
wanted<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.009> second<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> lot

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
wanted to go second because I got a lot

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.760 
wanted to go second because I got a lot
of<00:01:56.039> rough<00:01:56.340> water<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:57.509> 25<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
of rough water in the first 25 so I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.870 
of rough water in the first 25 so I
think<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.220> been<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> little<00:01:59.610> better

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
think would have been a little better

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
think would have been a little better
than<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.720> third<00:02:01.700> pretty<00:02:02.700> crazy<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.060> thank

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
than going third pretty crazy to thank

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.870 
than going third pretty crazy to thank
you<00:02:03.330> God<00:02:03.539> could<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.020> gone<00:02:04.140> faster<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:05.070> don't

same<00:03:10.450> thing<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.640> only<00:03:12.730> way<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:12.910> be

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
same thing again it's the only way to be

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.570 
same thing again it's the only way to be
disappointed<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.930> 40-point<00:03:14.560> mid<00:03:14.980> hundred

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
