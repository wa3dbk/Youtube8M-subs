00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.950
 announcer to speak or how to say to 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.290

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.450
 the diaphragm just like it does 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.990
 a singer an actor yourself ok what 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.690
 unique is that one adds the illusion of 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:34.530
 do not move the lips the character the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.330
 acting if they have as headlines as 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.790
 a magic like an illusion but 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.420
 it really is a performance like 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.420
 any other 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.200
 when you want to say something, it is 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.300
 sorry and you do not dare to say it 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.930
 says through cooking 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.930
 sometimes 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.470
 more or less on what good times I do not know 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.120

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.160
 the brakes already and guys please no 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.670

 the one who is in love with you is me but 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.140
 is that I like to see her 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.459
