all<00:00:12.440> right<00:00:12.560> now<00:00:12.710> we're<00:00:12.890> going<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.250> be<00:00:13.400> doing

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
all right now we're going to be doing

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.810 
all right now we're going to be doing
simple<00:00:14.180> subtraction<00:00:15.020> in<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.580> ones<00:00:16.580> column

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
simple subtraction in the ones column

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.689 
simple subtraction in the ones column
the<00:00:17.390> ones<00:00:17.600> column<00:00:17.810> right<00:00:18.140> here<00:00:18.340> but<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:19.640> time

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
the ones column right here but this time

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.429 
the ones column right here but this time
we're<00:00:20.089> going<00:00:20.269> to<00:00:20.390> be<00:00:20.539> using<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:20.990> heavenly

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
we're going to be using the heavenly

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.759 
we're going to be using the heavenly
beads<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.880> earthly<00:00:23.089> beads<00:00:23.589> not<00:00:24.589> much

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
beads and the earthly beads not much

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.950 
beads and the earthly beads not much
harder<00:00:25.160> but<00:00:25.339> a<00:00:25.579> little<00:00:26.269> bit<00:00:26.449> more<00:00:26.599> complicated

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
harder but a little bit more complicated

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.019 
harder but a little bit more complicated
you<00:00:27.589> remember<00:00:27.949> that<00:00:28.099> from<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.339> addition<00:00:28.880> that

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
you remember that from the addition that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.720 
you remember that from the addition that
because<00:00:29.869> they<00:00:30.140> just<00:00:30.589> a<00:00:30.739> reminder<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.400> know<00:00:31.550> you

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
because they just a reminder I know you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.350 
because they just a reminder I know you
know<00:00:31.909> this<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.530> heavenly<00:00:34.100> beads<00:00:34.400> are

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
know this but the heavenly beads are

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.020 
know this but the heavenly beads are
worth<00:00:35.750> five<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.890> earthly<00:00:37.219> beads<00:00:37.730> are

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
worth five and the earthly beads are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.110 
worth five and the earthly beads are
worth<00:00:38.329> one<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.859> it<00:00:39.980> brings<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.309> little<00:00:40.609> bit<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.030> a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
worth one so it brings a little bit of a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.439 
worth one so it brings a little bit of a
different<00:00:41.949> different<00:00:42.949> dimension<00:00:43.879> into<00:00:44.059> the

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
different different dimension into the

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.779 
different different dimension into the
using<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.289> abacus<00:00:45.739> because<00:00:46.100> we're<00:00:46.430> used<00:00:46.670> to

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
using the abacus because we're used to

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.119 
using the abacus because we're used to
counting<00:00:47.210> by<00:00:47.329> ones<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.410> counting<00:00:48.739> with<00:00:48.859> fives

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
counting by ones but counting with fives

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.369 
counting by ones but counting with fives
and<00:00:49.489> ones<00:00:49.579> it's<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.210> little<00:00:50.480> bit<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.780> little<00:00:51.260> bit

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
and ones it's a little bit a little bit

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.720 
and ones it's a little bit a little bit
more<00:00:51.530> difficult<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.070> piece<00:00:52.399> of<00:00:52.579> cake

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
more difficult but a piece of cake

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.799 
more difficult but a piece of cake
because<00:00:52.820> you've<00:00:53.059> already<00:00:53.239> done<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.600> before

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
because you've already done this before

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.060 
because you've already done this before
and<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.070> already<00:00:55.370> know<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.739> when<00:00:57.739> we<00:00:57.890> move

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and you already know that when we move

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.799 
and you already know that when we move
something<00:00:58.390> towards<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> beam<00:00:59.660> we're

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
something towards the beam we're

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.319 
something towards the beam we're
counting<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.320> this<00:01:00.530> says<00:01:00.800> five<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.429> if<00:01:02.149> we're

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
counting it this says five and if we're

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.689 
counting it this says five and if we're
going<00:01:02.539> to<00:01:02.629> take<00:01:02.960> away<00:01:03.140> five<00:01:03.620> or<00:01:03.890> subtract<00:01:04.430> five

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
going to take away five or subtract five

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.330 
going to take away five or subtract five
from<00:01:04.730> this<00:01:05.059> we<00:01:05.210> move<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.510> away<00:01:05.600> from<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.990> beam

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
from this we move it away from the beam

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.850 
from this we move it away from the beam
easy<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.730> that<00:01:08.079> okay<00:01:09.079> so<00:01:09.140> let's<00:01:09.409> do<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> problem

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
easy is that okay so let's do a problem

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.210 
easy is that okay so let's do a problem
let's<00:01:10.640> put<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.030> number<00:01:11.390> nine<00:01:12.049> on<00:01:12.560> our<00:01:12.680> abacus

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
let's put the number nine on our abacus

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.999 
let's put the number nine on our abacus
and<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:14.479> know<00:01:14.689> from<00:01:15.229> doing<00:01:15.380> your<00:01:15.500> addition

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
and you know from doing your addition

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.969 
and you know from doing your addition
that<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.310> number<00:01:16.579> nine<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.210> 5<00:01:17.869> plus<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.680> 4

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that the number nine is a 5 plus a 4

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.550 
that the number nine is a 5 plus a 4
this<00:01:19.610> says<00:01:19.850> 9<00:01:20.090> ok<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.479> let's<00:01:23.720> do<00:01:23.899> that<00:01:23.930> I

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
this says 9 ok so so let's do that I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.679 
this says 9 ok so so let's do that I
believe<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.220> know<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:25.880> is<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.060> piece<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.479> cake

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
believe you know this is a piece of cake

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.069 
believe you know this is a piece of cake
so<00:01:27.110> 9<00:01:27.670> minus<00:01:28.670> or<00:01:29.450> 9<00:01:30.170> take<00:01:30.619> away<00:01:30.649> 5<00:01:31.509> well<00:01:32.509> all<00:01:32.899> I

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
so 9 minus or 9 take away 5 well all I

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.539 
so 9 minus or 9 take away 5 well all I
have<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.409> do<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.909> take<00:01:34.909> away<00:01:35.090> 5<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:39.340> what<00:01:40.340> am<00:01:40.430> I

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
have to do is take away 5 and what am I

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.270 
have to do is take away 5 and what am I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.569 
number seven on your abacus there is the
number<00:02:33.049> seven<00:02:33.439> and<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.889> were<00:02:34.010> going<00:02:34.219> to<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.459> is

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
number seven and we were going to do is

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.179 
number seven and we were going to do is
7<00:02:35.480> minus<00:02:36.290> 5<00:02:38.230> maybe<00:02:39.230> you're<00:02:39.530> seeing<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.859> pattern

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
7 minus 5 maybe you're seeing a pattern

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.390 
7 minus 5 maybe you're seeing a pattern
so<00:02:40.819> 7<00:02:41.389> minus<00:02:41.719> 5<00:02:41.930> well<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.859> means<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.129> got<00:02:43.280> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
so 7 minus 5 well that means I got to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.360 
so 7 minus 5 well that means I got to
take<00:02:43.579> away<00:02:43.700> 5<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.329> move<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.689> away<00:02:44.750> from<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
take away 5 and move it away from the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.720 
take away 5 and move it away from the
beam<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:48.290> am<00:02:48.379> I<00:02:48.469> left<00:02:48.620> with<00:02:48.769> is<00:02:49.159> 2<00:02:50.019> 7<00:02:51.430> minus<00:02:52.430> 5

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
beam what am I left with is 2 7 minus 5

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.819 
beam what am I left with is 2 7 minus 5
is<00:02:54.159> 2<00:02:57.819> piece<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.970> cake

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
is 2 piece of cake

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.550 
is 2 piece of cake
all<00:03:00.829> right<00:03:01.450> let's<00:03:02.450> do<00:03:02.629> one<00:03:02.900> that's<00:03:03.139> just<00:03:03.230> a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
all right let's do one that's just a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.959 
all right let's do one that's just a
little<00:03:03.980> bit<00:03:04.129> different<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:04.819> 8<00:03:05.680> minus<00:03:06.680> 2<00:03:06.969> put

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
little bit different so 8 minus 2 put

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.740 
little bit different so 8 minus 2 put
the<00:03:08.060> number<00:03:08.329> 8<00:03:08.569> on<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:09.109> again<00:03:09.819> 8<00:03:10.819> minus<00:03:11.450> 2

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the number 8 on here again 8 minus 2

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.559 
the number 8 on here again 8 minus 2
well<00:03:12.560> we're<00:03:12.950> subtracting<00:03:13.189> 2<00:03:13.849> this<00:03:14.030> time<00:03:14.269> and

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
well we're subtracting 2 this time and

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.030 
well we're subtracting 2 this time and
that<00:03:14.689> those<00:03:14.900> are<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.139> earthly<00:03:15.530> beads<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:15.950> I'm

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that those are the earthly beads so I'm

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.929 
that those are the earthly beads so I'm
going<00:03:16.219> to<00:03:16.250> slide<00:03:16.549> two<00:03:16.879> of<00:03:17.000> those<00:03:17.150> away<00:03:18.370> 8<00:03:19.370> minus

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
going to slide two of those away 8 minus

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.009 
going to slide two of those away 8 minus
2<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.769> what's<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.010> number<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.579> number

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
2 is what's that number it is the number

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.699 
2 is what's that number it is the number
6<00:03:27.489> 8<00:03:28.489> minus<00:03:29.060> 2<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.629> 6<00:03:31.900> piece<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.079> cake<00:03:33.260> let's<00:03:33.560> do

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
6 8 minus 2 is 6 piece of cake let's do

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.219 
6 8 minus 2 is 6 piece of cake let's do
one<00:03:33.889> more<00:03:33.919> of<00:03:34.189> those<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.549> well<00:03:34.780> one<00:03:35.780> more<00:03:35.989> of

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
one more of those so well one more of

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.640 
one more of those so well one more of
the<00:03:36.620> ones<00:03:36.859> that<00:03:37.040> are<00:03:37.840> yeah<00:03:38.840> anyways<00:03:39.379> okay

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
number 6 there is the number 6 on our

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:57.909 
number 6 there is the number 6 on our
abacus<00:03:50.590> 6<00:03:51.790> subtract<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:53.169> 6-1<00:03:55.389> 6-1<00:03:56.389> is<00:03:56.959> well

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
abacus 6 subtract or 6-1 6-1 is well

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.490 
abacus 6 subtract or 6-1 6-1 is well
take<00:03:58.519> away<00:03:58.669> 1<00:03:58.909> 6<00:03:59.509> minus<00:03:59.840> 1<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.049> 5

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
take away 1 6 minus 1 is 5

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.530 
take away 1 6 minus 1 is 5
it's<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.639> little<00:04:01.790> 5<00:04:02.150> left<00:04:02.569> up<00:04:02.750> there<00:04:03.699> so<00:04:04.699> 6

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
it's just a little 5 left up there so 6

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.399 
it's just a little 5 left up there so 6
minus<00:04:05.689> 5<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.319> 1<00:04:10.419> all<00:04:11.419> right<00:04:11.479> I<00:04:11.750> think<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.229> got
