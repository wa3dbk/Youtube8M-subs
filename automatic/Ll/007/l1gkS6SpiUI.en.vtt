guitar Society calm to share with you
some<00:00:33.420> information<00:00:33.800> hopefully<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:34.980> examples

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
some information hopefully some examples

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.139 
some information hopefully some examples
of<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:37.500> approach<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> playing<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> was

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
of that approach to playing that I was

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.690 
of that approach to playing that I was
just<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.739> playing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just think about this is that playing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
just think about this is that playing
melodies<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.780> chord<00:00:43.170> Allah<00:00:43.410> comes<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:45.050> to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
melodies with chord Allah comes on to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.430 
melodies with chord Allah comes on to
note<00:00:46.260> chords<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.760> brief<00:00:48.059> cards<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
note chords just little brief cards that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.000 
note chords just little brief cards that
are<00:00:49.940> essentially<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> seven

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
are essentially the three and the seven

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
are essentially the three and the seven
of<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.789> particular<00:00:54.329> chord<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.930> chord<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.260> call

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of a particular chord the chord I call

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
of a particular chord the chord I call
them<00:00:55.620> essence<00:00:56.039> chords<00:00:56.520> by<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.940> because

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
them essence chords by the way because

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.060 
them essence chords by the way because
that<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.289> sound<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.770> essence

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that to me they sound like the essence

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
that to me they sound like the essence
of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> chord

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.750 

they<00:01:05.140> are<00:01:05.290> useful<00:01:05.740> here<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.280> many<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.640> you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
they are useful here and many of you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.570 
they are useful here and many of you
already<00:01:06.940> know<00:01:07.240> them<00:01:07.450> there<00:01:07.660> I<00:01:07.690> would<00:01:08.020> imagine

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
already know them there I would imagine

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.400 
already know them there I would imagine
but<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:10.030> you're<00:01:10.330> limited<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.870> terms<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.290> the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
but that you're limited in terms of the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.870 
but that you're limited in terms of the
number<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.740> melody<00:01:12.190> notes<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.730> have

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
number of melody notes that you have

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.270 
number of melody notes that you have
access<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.570> when<00:01:14.230> you're<00:01:14.380> playing<00:01:14.650> on<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.860> d

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
access to when you're playing on the d

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.720 
access to when you're playing on the d
and<00:01:15.430> g<00:01:15.550> string<00:01:16.000> but<00:01:16.780> if<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.020> move<00:01:17.200> five<00:01:18.190> frets

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
and g string but if you move five frets

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.290 
and g string but if you move five frets
up<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.570> one<00:01:19.990> set<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.410> strings<00:01:20.680> down<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:22.120> get

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
up and one set of strings down to get

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.930 
up and one set of strings down to get
your<00:01:22.590> chords<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:24.010> G<00:01:24.670> major<00:01:24.880> 7<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.860> minor<00:01:26.940> d7

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
your chords here G major 7 a minor d7

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.870 
your chords here G major 7 a minor d7
and<00:01:28.870> G<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.800> ISA<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:32.290> above<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.580> have<00:01:33.730> one

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
and G and ISA then above we have one

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.700 
and G and ISA then above we have one
more<00:01:34.060> string<00:01:34.390> really<00:01:34.750> above<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:35.440> we<00:01:35.530> can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
more string really above that so we can

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.870 
more string really above that so we can
have<00:01:35.890> three<00:01:36.370> strings<00:01:37.300> worth<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.720> melody<00:01:38.140> notes

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
have three strings worth of melody notes

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.660 
have three strings worth of melody notes
which<00:01:39.880> gives<00:01:40.150> us<00:01:40.270> about<00:01:40.600> another<00:01:41.250> maybe<00:01:42.250> fifth

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
which gives us about another maybe fifth

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.300 
which gives us about another maybe fifth
or<00:01:42.910> more<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.630> imagine<00:01:44.320> there's<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.560> soloist<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
or more of imagine there's a soloist and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.180 
or more of imagine there's a soloist and
I'm<00:01:45.490> playing<00:01:46.050> behind<00:01:47.050> them<00:01:47.410> in<00:01:47.680> fact<00:01:47.860> if<00:01:48.070> you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
I'm playing behind them in fact if you

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.820 
I'm playing behind them in fact if you
want<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.490> play<00:01:48.610> along<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:50.170> be<00:01:50.560> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
want to play along you can be the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:02.789 
want to play along you can be the
soloist<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.460> all<00:01:51.610> accompany<00:01:52.060> you

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.710 

I<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.920> go<00:02:09.039> about<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.729> root<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.179> octave

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
I can go about up to the root on octave

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.869 
I can go about up to the root on octave
and<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.019> higher<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:15.550> gonna<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
and have a higher I'm gonna have to

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.360 
and have a higher I'm gonna have to
change<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.180> fingering<00:02:19.890> similarly<00:02:20.890> from<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
change my fingering similarly from the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.530 
change my fingering similarly from the
fourth<00:02:21.670> degree<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.360> two<00:02:22.540> chord<00:02:27.450> then<00:02:28.450> you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
fourth degree of the two chord then you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.190 
fourth degree of the two chord then you
can<00:02:28.690> maybe<00:02:28.810> even<00:02:29.080> go<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.349> here<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:32.080> on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
can maybe even go to here and then on

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400 
can maybe even go to here and then on
the<00:02:32.319> five<00:02:32.530> chord<00:02:33.360> why<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.660> start<00:02:35.049> say

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
the five chord why we can start say

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.960 
the five chord why we can start say
maybe<00:02:35.769> from<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.160> root<00:02:38.579> myself<00:02:39.579> for<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:39.940> I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
maybe from the root myself for now I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.520 
maybe from the root myself for now I
just<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.720> spend<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.049> little<00:02:41.140> just<00:02:41.440> a
