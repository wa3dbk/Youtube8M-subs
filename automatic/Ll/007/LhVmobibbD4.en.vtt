more soon enough I'm just looking over

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.850 
more soon enough I'm just looking over
here<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.650> could<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:36.350> don't<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> go

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
here what could I do I don't want to go

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
here what could I do I don't want to go
I<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.189> didn't<00:01:38.909> want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> deploy<00:01:39.750> any<00:01:39.930> trips

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I don't didn't want to deploy any trips

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539 
I don't didn't want to deploy any trips
on<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.380> side<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:41.040> i<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.250> no<00:01:41.369> wall

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
on that side because i have no wall

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
on that side because i have no wall
breakers<00:01:41.939> left<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> mortar<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.320> range

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
breakers left and the mortar is in range

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
breakers left and the mortar is in range
but<00:01:44.549> i'll<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.790> rid<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> archer<00:01:45.540> tower

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
but i'll get rid of that archer tower

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
but i'll get rid of that archer tower
there<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.350> I'll<00:01:46.409> three<00:01:46.649> dads<00:01:46.829> marches<00:01:49.790> throw

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
there so I'll three dads marches throw

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
there so I'll three dads marches throw
down<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> rest<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.420> my<00:01:51.509> giants<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.680> some

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
down the rest of my giants and then some

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
down the rest of my giants and then some
arches<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.479> they'll<00:01:54.659> throw

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
arches and then I think they'll throw

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
arches and then I think they'll throw
down<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> rest<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.680> goblins<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
down the rest of my goblins so it was a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.459 
down the rest of my goblins so it was a
probably<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> bad<00:02:00.450> idea<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.229> more

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
probably a bad idea because that more

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
probably a bad idea because that more
art<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.130> still<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.759> range<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.479> goblins

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
art is still in range of those goblins

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.370 
art is still in range of those goblins
but<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:06.000> long<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.020> getting<00:02:07.140> those

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
but as long as I'm getting those

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.969 
but as long as I'm getting those
resources<00:02:07.710> I'm<00:02:08.069> happy<00:02:09.349> my<00:02:10.349> troops<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.770> just

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
