it's not very quick yet but it gets

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020 
it's not very quick yet but it gets
faster<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.289> sound<00:01:07.610> interacts<00:01:08.610> with

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
faster the way the sound interacts with

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.540 
faster the way the sound interacts with
the<00:01:09.149> gameplay<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> great<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.770> music<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> very

and<00:01:19.640> there<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.170> saw<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.829> first<00:01:22.039> example

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and there you just saw the first example

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.959 
and there you just saw the first example
of<00:01:22.880> what<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.299> big<00:01:23.630> problem<00:01:24.049> on<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.409> game

of what is a big problem on this game
accuracy<00:01:25.969> of<00:01:26.060> control<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.479> easier<00:01:29.869> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
accuracy of control it is easier to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.139 
accuracy of control it is easier to
control<00:01:30.289> on<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.649> ps3<00:01:31.009> using<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.820> analog

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.530 
want to no I can't
half<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.160> time

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.420 

and<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.140> very<00:02:56.500> very<00:02:57.040> frustrating

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and that is very very frustrating

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.550 
and that is very very frustrating
because<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.270> mean<00:02:58.480> when<00:02:58.989> there<00:02:59.230> are<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.530> few

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
because I mean when there are so few

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.559 
because I mean when there are so few
objectives<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.550> this<00:03:00.700> game<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.239> slow

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
objectives in this game you can slow

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.500 
objectives in this game you can slow
down<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.459> even<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.270> slow

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
down like that but to even have to slow

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.699 
down like that but to even have to slow
down<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.959> much<00:03:05.020> just<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.739> good<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.170> know<00:03:08.319> to

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
down that much just a good you know to

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.470 
down that much just a good you know to
grab<00:03:09.160> one<00:03:09.520> object<00:03:09.970> in<00:03:10.120> three-dimensional

porthole is doing
you<00:03:14.380> shouldn't<00:03:14.739> have<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.069> slow<00:03:15.310> down<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.730> a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
you shouldn't have to slow down to a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.640 
you shouldn't have to slow down to a
virtual<00:03:16.180> standstill<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.989> be<00:03:17.110> able<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.380> do<00:03:17.560> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
virtual standstill to be able to do it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.610 
virtual standstill to be able to do it
with<00:03:17.769> any<00:03:17.920> accuracy<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.349> bad<00:03:20.860> that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.870 

do<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.709> see<00:03:26.860> what<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> mean<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.489> mean<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.700> don't

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
do you see what I mean I mean I don't

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.289 
do you see what I mean I mean I don't
want<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> labor<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.019> point<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.400> could<00:03:30.970> have

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
want to labor the point this could have

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.850 
want to labor the point this could have
been<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.780> fantastic<00:03:32.680> game<00:03:34.319> but<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.440> controls

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
been a fantastic game but the controls

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.760 
been a fantastic game but the controls
are<00:03:36.040> broken<00:03:36.519> in<00:03:36.760> my<00:03:36.970> opinion

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
are broken in my opinion

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.190 
are broken in my opinion
so<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.460> hit<00:03:39.820> every<00:03:40.210> one<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.450> those<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
so that I hit every one of those I

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.240 
so that I hit every one of those I
shouldn't<00:03:41.650> have<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.380> there's<00:03:44.560> no<00:03:44.830> precision

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
shouldn't have but there's no precision

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.550 
shouldn't have but there's no precision
whatsoever<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.660> way<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.840> can<00:03:47.080> control

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
whatsoever in in the way you can control

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.250 
whatsoever in in the way you can control
it<00:03:51.270> I'll<00:03:52.270> have<00:03:52.510> another<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:55.260> glutton

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
it I'll have another go just a glutton

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.780 
it I'll have another go just a glutton
for<00:03:56.290> punishment<00:03:56.440> or<00:03:56.980> something<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.430> don't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
for punishment or something I don't

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.960 
for punishment or something I don't
think<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.060> work<00:03:58.270> did<00:03:58.540> it<00:04:00.360> come<00:04:01.360> on<00:04:05.790> come<00:04:06.790> on

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970

dude<00:04:07.120> are<00:04:11.220> infesting<00:04:12.220> Lee<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:13.090> looks<00:04:13.450> nicer<00:04:13.930> on

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
dude are infesting Lee it looks nicer on

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.670 
dude are infesting Lee it looks nicer on
the<00:04:14.920> PSP<00:04:15.270> it<00:04:16.270> controls<00:04:16.750> worse<00:04:17.110> and<00:04:17.530> you

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the PSP it controls worse and you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.229 
the PSP it controls worse and you
wouldn't<00:04:17.890> think<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.190> could<00:04:18.340> get<00:04:18.489> worse<00:04:18.730> but<00:04:19.120> it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
wouldn't think it could get worse but it

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.770 
wouldn't think it could get worse but it
does<00:04:19.420> but<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.230> looks<00:04:20.440> nicer<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:21.730> sharper<00:04:22.600> on

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
does but it looks nicer it's sharper on

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:34.040 
does but it looks nicer it's sharper on
the<00:04:23.080> PSP

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.480 

I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.539> can<00:04:36.810> actually<00:04:37.069> identify<00:04:38.069> what<00:04:38.099> the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
I think I can actually identify what the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.869 
I think I can actually identify what the
problem<00:04:38.849> is<00:04:38.970> here<00:04:39.270> with<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.690> control<00:04:40.169> system

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
problem is here with this control system

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.719 
problem is here with this control system
these<00:04:41.879> pipes<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.659> you're<00:04:42.840> going<00:04:43.169> through

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
these pipes that you're going through

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.930 
these pipes that you're going through
are<00:04:44.729> curved<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:46.199> your<00:04:46.590> trajectory<00:04:46.889> is<00:04:47.550> curved

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
are curved and your trajectory is curved

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.110 
are curved and your trajectory is curved
so<00:04:48.449> while<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.900> might<00:04:49.729> point<00:04:50.729> yourself<00:04:52.639> at<00:04:53.639> one

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
so while you might point yourself at one

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.930 
so while you might point yourself at one
of<00:04:54.270> them<00:04:54.539> it<00:04:55.440> doesn't<00:04:55.860> stay<00:04:56.159> slap<00:04:56.550> bang<00:04:56.759> in<00:04:56.789> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
of them it doesn't stay slap bang in the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.140 
of them it doesn't stay slap bang in the
center<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:58.430> think<00:04:59.430> that's<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.930> just<00:05:00.930> yeah<00:05:02.150> it

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
center I think that's it just yeah it

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.290 
center I think that's it just yeah it
doesn't<00:05:03.509> ever<00:05:03.690> want<00:05:04.520> once<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.639> targeted<00:05:06.180> it

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
doesn't ever want once you targeted it

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.700 
doesn't ever want once you targeted it
you<00:05:06.479> just<00:05:06.719> don't<00:05:06.870> know<00:05:07.080> where<00:05:07.259> it's<00:05:07.440> going<00:05:07.620> to

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
you just don't know where it's going to

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.830 
you just don't know where it's going to
appear<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.430> know<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.819> second<00:05:09.150> or<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.509> you

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
appear you know in a second or so you

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.350 
appear you know in a second or so you
can't<00:05:10.110> keep<00:05:10.319> it<00:05:10.530> centered<00:05:10.969> so<00:05:11.969> for<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> most

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
can't keep it centered so for the most

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.680 
can't keep it centered so for the most
part<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.780> just<00:05:12.810> can't<00:05:13.169> grab<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.620> things

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
part you just can't grab the things

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.300 
part you just can't grab the things
drives<00:05:15.690> me<00:05:15.870> mad<00:05:16.050> because<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:17.009> should<00:05:17.190> be

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
drives me mad because this should be

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.440 
drives me mad because this should be
fantastic

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.050 

in<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.080> defense<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.860> can't<00:05:25.640> remember<00:05:25.760> if<00:05:25.940> I

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
in this defense I can't remember if I

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.310 
in this defense I can't remember if I
said<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.390> before<00:05:26.540> or<00:05:26.810> not<00:05:26.960> because<00:05:27.200> I've

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
said this before or not because I've

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.350 
said this before or not because I've
done<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.560> couple<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.190> takes<00:05:28.430> now<00:05:28.670> my<00:05:28.850> camera<00:05:29.090> is

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
done a couple of takes now my camera is

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.620 
done a couple of takes now my camera is
actually<00:05:29.660> no<00:05:30.260> my<00:05:30.470> SD<00:05:30.860> card<00:05:31.160> had<00:05:32.060> count<00:05:32.360> outs

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
actually no my SD card had count outs

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.210 
actually no my SD card had count outs
I've<00:05:32.870> had<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.080> put<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.230> different<00:05:33.410> SD<00:05:33.800> card<00:05:34.070> and
