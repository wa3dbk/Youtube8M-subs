00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.660
 hi girls then like i said 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 the other day on facebook in a while 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.190
 it will be the birthday of my el 11 channel 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.170
 October and then thought of getting me one 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.740
 surprise series a series of give away 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.770
 and this time the prize is special 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.950
 because I chose a palette that langlo 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.140
 eo of the special because I know that the juve 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.180
 it is found in a few very few cities 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 Italian so I imagine that for many 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.220
 be complicated and difficult of you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.380
 finding it was very difficult 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.469
 choose these colors choose these 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.090
 five bretti because I'm already super e 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.649
 decided when I have to choose something 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 for me to choose something for others 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.489
 it's even more complicated and I chose to 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 take autumn colors since 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 we are going towards autumn so i have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 thought it was the best choice 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.470
 so now I'll show you then go 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.120
 said that the clashes why not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.360
 it would be nice that along with the headstock 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 also the receipts and the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
 umbrellas were in these postcards 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 but I took them from here and put them on 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 inside the gym that way 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 even for shipping it will be easier 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 for me it will also be safer for you than 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 the package arrives beautiful healthy because 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.750
 being the wafers in a palette 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.600
 remain beautiful sales rather than 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.380
 all scattered in the package at this point is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 this handbag and this note is the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.530
 pallets are then I find myself or two 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 stick them another eye shadow e 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.550
 the other with the lipsticks I found myself 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 very good because eye shadows write 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.990
 so many are beautiful pigmented and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.460
 just as I told you, they are all 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.050
 autumn colors 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.830
 and then I'll show you one by one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.570
 this is how it looks then vi 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.310
 I explain a little about the choices I made 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 wanted to take a clear eye shadow 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 because in my opinion in all the breakdowns and there 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.149
 it must be a clear eye shadow and this 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.180
 it is a golden white which is therefore a good 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.700
 little for all then I wanted to take a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 dark eyeshadow that of course there 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.520
 will also allow dark eyeshadow e 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 this is a dark gray to be 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.750
 quite dark and then I took this 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
 which reminds me a lot of copyright 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.230
 of the mag 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 and this marone that goes so much on red and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.840
 he is divinely for those with eyes 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.670
 brown then this green because me 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.680
 really liked these three 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 colors reminded me so much 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.500
 autumn and finally that which a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.720
 pomace and this also reminded me 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.120
 very much the autumn wanted to take it 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.790
 for this reason therefore these 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.600
 they are the five eyeshadows I better them 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.040
 you can place in this order 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.610
 change totally reposition them in 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.860
 other way 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.510
 so this is the palette I like 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.130
 very much indeed I am thinking of 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.050

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.270
