00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.069
 another video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.490
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 your new iphone 5 it 15 or even one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 iPhone 5 definitely with 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.330
 ios 7 installed the first time 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 so we set up through this 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.940
 configuration wizard thereby 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 comes and basically starts the whole thing 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.260
 course, first by the sim 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:31.619
 insert card that we do after the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 intro is the sim card insertion 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.950
 actually super easy you need 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.230
 first, of course, a commercial 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 name sim card or if you have an iphone 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.399
 4s then have a micro sim card if 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 you do not have or do not know what it is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.700
 is just times with your provider 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.469
 Ask for help then sure 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.730
 furthermore you need this 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.250
 small tool here that lies in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.329
 scope of delivery of every iphone at and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 We can use it to sim-cards 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.649
 let sled out, so to speak 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 it is always on the right side of yours 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.449
 Handy and you have to always with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.309
 This one he will need this hole once 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 Press a little and then drive 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.060
 the sim-cards sled so a piece 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 out and you can grab them like that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869
 So here is the sled and the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 sim card really only fits in the reason 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.040
 in a direction to say so in there and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.439
 so you have to look there is one 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 Beveled knew and so you have to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.939
 just then insert this and fit 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 if you've done that then you push 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.250
 These cities just come in here again 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.020
 so until it does work and you have 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 her the sim card installed if you 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 now the phone makes and former 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.360
 suffers then her sim lock and now 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.049
 you have to do the SIM card once 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.909
 unlocking 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.040
 it continues with the follow up 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.600
 the installation wizard that is 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 we will speak our language here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 my case german 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 that takes a little moment and then 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.030
 Let's get to the next step 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 so now we have to land or 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.229
 I'll take that region as well now 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 Germany and now you have to in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 dial in a wlan network and if you like 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.899
 then typed in the password 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.310
 connect her on 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.990
 there again a little moment 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 wait that usually does not last 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.670
 long and you are with your wlan 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.170
 network connected now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.220
 no wifi then you can do that too 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 the mobile 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 The mobile network basically does that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.950
 you would then choose there 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.900
 can and now the iphone will be short 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 activated for this is always mandatory 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 required that just a sim card in the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.980
 slot in it is otherwise that works 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.720
 Not 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.730
 it continues with the location services 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.650
 Generally you do not necessarily need that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 if you do not put them on then saves 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.210
 you even battery but there are some 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.770
 apps that need them or too 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.400
 work much better if they work 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.800
 they have 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 That's why I say here first activate 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.280
 and now the question is yours 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.830
 first iphone or do you want a new one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 configure iphone basically so 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.520
 So you start completely at zero yours 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 then data itself gradually 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.690
 you play or you want to play again 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.340
 Use existing back up so that you 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 For example, if you know what you are 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.900
 had an iphone 5 and is coming now 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790
 on 5 s that you then all data one to 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.260
 have one back on your device at 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.330
 this would be the case for me now 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.720
 want to configure new anyway 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.010
 once briefly on iCloud backup then 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.080
 Just log in with yours 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.120
 apple id and your password click on 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.040
 then you choose which backup 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 you want to use and then it will 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.489
 backup recorded that takes a while 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.290
 little moment there you have one yes 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.420
 have patience and as soon as it 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.610
 then your apps will be finished again 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.769
 downloaded and you have too 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.959
 your whole pictures your attitude yours 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.970
 sms few runs and what i do not know 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.920
 all one on one again on yours 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.180
 iphone is a great thing we say 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.610
 but now as a new iphone 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.989
 configure and either we create 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.870
 a new apple id if you do not have one 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.030
 have or we just go away and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.780
 lure us with our apple id that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.820
 I'm going to make it short 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.410
 as soon as you have logged in 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.580
 or create a new account 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.290
 you have to briefly the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.750
 terms of use 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.760
 Of course you can read them and then 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.670
 you click on accept again 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.350
 accept and then the whole thing will be 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.180
 short set up and that is 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.910
 actually then almost the same 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.650
 last step is now so far namely 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 already done everything you can now 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.580
 still use the icloud or is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.140
 stay I can want the to 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.840
 do not use this example now 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.370
 Now you can join Amazon facetime 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.739
 on 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.150
 depending on what you just before ever 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.709
 have asked or you have one 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.389
 have created a new account in the reason 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.220
 there are different things 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.639
 You can put a cure or it 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.560
 continue to stay and you can 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.440
 Use siri or let it stay 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.590
 i would like to use it so diagnose 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.180
 could send or not and that was it 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 Now also really welcome 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.740
 iphone starts and hearty 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.389
 Congratulations you have succeeded 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.220
