For Ever HD foundation

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.629 
For Ever HD foundation
I<00:00:05.580> got<00:00:06.450> shade<00:00:06.859> 117<00:00:07.859> which<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.220> pretty<00:00:08.370> sure<00:00:08.519> is

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
I got shade 117 which I'm pretty sure is

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.450 
I got shade 117 which I'm pretty sure is
called<00:00:09.210> marble<00:00:09.769> and<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.889> think<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
called marble and I think this is the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.490 
called marble and I think this is the
perfect<00:00:11.639> match<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.330> me<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.960> girl<00:00:13.139> Sephora

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
perfect match for me the girl Sephora

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.900 
perfect match for me the girl Sephora
gave<00:00:13.650> me<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> couple<00:00:14.040> other<00:00:14.219> shades<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.849> I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
gave me a couple other shades but I

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
gave me a couple other shades but I
think<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.360> one's<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.630> closest<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.410> don't

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
think this one's the closest I don't

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.620 
think this one's the closest I don't
think<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> full-coverage<00:00:18.240> foundation

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
think this is a full-coverage foundation

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.689 
think this is a full-coverage foundation

mrs.<00:01:06.720> Sigma<00:01:07.020> f80<00:01:07.560> brush<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.460> kabuki<00:01:08.850> brush

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
mrs. Sigma f80 brush the kabuki brush

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.930 
mrs. Sigma f80 brush the kabuki brush
but<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> feel<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.630> everybody<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:11.600> okay

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.270 

start<00:01:17.940> buffing<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.630> done

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.040 

so<00:01:22.880> far<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.150> seems<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.510> be<00:01:23.570> covering<00:01:23.930> my

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
so far it seems to be covering my

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.709 
so far it seems to be covering my
redness

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.719 

I<00:01:30.749> think<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.469> is<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.799> color<00:01:32.070> too<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:32.429> that's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I think this is my color too so that's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.149 
I think this is my color too so that's
good

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.149 

goes<00:01:40.760> on<00:01:40.970> very<00:01:41.150> nicely<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:41.930> don't<00:01:42.830> feels<00:01:43.040> like

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
goes on very nicely I don't feels like

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:53.330 
goes on very nicely I don't feels like
water

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370 

so<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.149> far<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> seems<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.930> covered<00:01:55.229> my

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so so far it seems to have covered my

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.719 
so so far it seems to have covered my
redness<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.159> definitely<00:01:56.250> tell<00:01:56.610> if

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
redness but I can definitely tell if

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.870 
redness but I can definitely tell if
this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.420> full<00:01:57.659> coverage<00:01:58.520> foundation

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.789 

but<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.540> does<00:02:04.689> seem<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:04.930> match<00:02:05.229> me<00:02:05.560> like

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
but it does seem to match me like

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.620 
but it does seem to match me like
perfectly<00:02:06.460> no<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.360> really<00:02:07.719> dry<00:02:07.990> skin

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
perfectly no I do have really dry skin

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.240 
perfectly no I do have really dry skin
how<00:02:10.630> do<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.810> feel<00:02:10.929> like<00:02:11.020> it's<00:02:11.200> kind<00:02:11.470> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.040 

I<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.820> feel<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.270> might<00:02:17.420> some<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.780> my<00:02:17.870> dry

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
I do feel like I might some of my dry

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.540 
I do feel like I might some of my dry
patches<00:02:18.320> like<00:02:18.590> my<00:02:18.740> nose<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.190> said<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.490> you

they're<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.240> wintertime<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.910> it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
they're in this wintertime so it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.050 
they're in this wintertime so it
definitely<00:03:19.060> does<00:03:19.420> look<00:03:19.450> natural<00:03:20.850> except<00:03:21.850> for

the parts that it clung to where I'm
looking<00:03:24.160> really<00:03:24.310> dry<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:29.260> would<00:03:29.890> definitely

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
looking really dry I would definitely

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.310 
looking really dry I would definitely
say<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.460> is<00:03:30.580> more<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.960> medium<00:03:31.960> cover

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
say this is more of a medium cover

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.010 
say this is more of a medium cover
foundation<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.910> did<00:03:34.210> cover<00:03:34.420> my<00:03:34.660> redness

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
foundation it did cover my redness

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.120 
foundation it did cover my redness
between<00:03:35.470> my<00:03:35.770> like<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.940> my<00:03:37.090> cheeks<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.920> do<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.100> a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
between my like on my cheeks I do have a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.410 
between my like on my cheeks I do have a
little<00:03:39.280> bit<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.430> hyperpigmentation<00:03:39.820> right

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
little bit of hyperpigmentation right

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.750 
little bit of hyperpigmentation right
here<00:03:40.660> which<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.930> did<00:03:41.080> not<00:03:41.160> fully<00:03:42.160> cover<00:03:42.490> so<00:03:42.700> I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
here which it did not fully cover so I

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.100 
here which it did not fully cover so I
would<00:03:42.940> have<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.209> use<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.330> concealer<00:03:43.750> which

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
would have to use a concealer which

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.380 
would have to use a concealer which
really<00:03:44.440> isn't<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.950> big<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.670> deal<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.330> I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
really isn't that big of a deal so I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.970 
really isn't that big of a deal so I
don't<00:03:46.540> know<00:03:46.600> I'm<00:03:46.750> gonna<00:03:46.900> let<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.590> a

I'm<00:04:49.810> going<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.320> purchase<00:04:50.530> this<00:04:50.830> but

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
I'm going to purchase this but

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.450 
I'm going to purchase this but
I<00:04:51.110> think<00:04:51.319> I'm<00:04:51.409> gonna<00:04:51.530> wait<00:04:51.830> until<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:52.220> summer

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
I think I'm gonna wait until the summer

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.020 
I think I'm gonna wait until the summer
just<00:04:52.699> because<00:04:52.819> it's<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.240> very<00:04:53.509> lightweight

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
just because it's a very lightweight

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.309 
just because it's a very lightweight
natural-looking<00:04:56.030> foundation<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.139> not

natural-looking foundation it is not

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.719 
natural-looking foundation it is not
full<00:04:57.560> coverage<00:04:57.590> it's<00:04:58.220> definitely<00:04:58.550> more<00:04:58.669> than

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
full coverage it's definitely more than

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.320 
full coverage it's definitely more than

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
my dry spots I looked in the mirror a

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.439 
my dry spots I looked in the mirror a
half<00:06:06.379> hour<00:06:06.589> after<00:06:06.889> that<00:06:07.129> and<00:06:07.639> I<00:06:07.940> did<00:06:08.060> not<00:06:08.180> see

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
half hour after that and I did not see

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.909 
half hour after that and I did not see
that<00:06:08.479> anymore<00:06:08.839> so<00:06:09.020> I<00:06:09.169> think<00:06:09.259> that<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:09.650> kind<00:06:09.889> of

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
that anymore so I think that I kind of

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.619 
that anymore so I think that I kind of
just<00:06:10.069> took<00:06:10.279> the<00:06:10.460> wall<00:06:10.639> for<00:06:10.879> the<00:06:10.940> foundation<00:06:11.599> to

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
just took the wall for the foundation to

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.920 
just took the wall for the foundation to
kind<00:06:11.870> of<00:06:11.930> settle<00:06:12.229> on<00:06:12.440> my<00:06:12.589> skin<00:06:12.979> but<00:06:13.789> yeah<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.300> was

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
kind of settle on my skin but yeah I was

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.059 
kind of settle on my skin but yeah I was
worried<00:06:15.199> about<00:06:15.259> that<00:06:15.560> I<00:06:15.620> thought<00:06:15.889> that<00:06:15.919> it

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
worried about that I thought that it

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.159 
worried about that I thought that it
wouldn't<00:06:16.370> work<00:06:16.490> with<00:06:16.729> my<00:06:16.879> dry<00:06:17.210> skin<00:06:17.599> but<00:06:17.900> it

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
wouldn't work with my dry skin but it

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.129 
wouldn't work with my dry skin but it
went<00:06:18.529> away<00:06:18.620> I<00:06:18.800> think<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.370> just<00:06:19.610> you<00:06:20.029> know<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.449> just

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
went away I think I just you know I just

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.529 
went away I think I just you know I just
applied<00:06:21.469> it<00:06:21.680> so<00:06:21.979> it's<00:06:22.639> very<00:06:22.729> natural<00:06:23.060> looking

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
applied it so it's very natural looking

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.290 
applied it so it's very natural looking
and<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.930> really<00:06:24.199> do<00:06:24.319> like<00:06:24.469> that<00:06:24.759> but<00:06:25.759> again<00:06:26.029> I

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
and I really do like that but again I

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.240 
and I really do like that but again I
feel<00:06:26.930> like<00:06:27.110> this<00:06:27.289> is<00:06:27.440> more<00:06:27.650> of<00:06:27.919> a<00:06:28.009> summer

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
feel like this is more of a summer

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.339 
feel like this is more of a summer
foundation<00:06:28.460> for<00:06:29.089> me<00:06:29.240> if<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.569> have<00:06:29.719> pretty

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
foundation for me if you have pretty

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.959 
foundation for me if you have pretty
much<00:06:30.500> flawless<00:06:30.830> skin<00:06:31.219> or<00:06:31.520> if<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:31.639> just<00:06:31.669> have<00:06:31.940> a

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
much flawless skin or if you just have a

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.339 
much flawless skin or if you just have a
little<00:06:32.150> bit<00:06:32.300> of<00:06:32.389> redness<00:06:32.599> that<00:06:32.779> you<00:06:33.080> want<00:06:33.289> to

little bit of redness that you want to
cover<00:06:33.529> up<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.949> think<00:06:34.219> that<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.759> would<00:06:34.909> really

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
cover up I think that you would really

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.119 
cover up I think that you would really
enjoy<00:06:35.270> this<00:06:35.629> foundation<00:06:36.199> and<00:06:36.379> I'd<00:06:36.500> be<00:06:36.680> perfect

enjoy this foundation and I'd be perfect

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
for you I do have a lot of scarring from

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.829 
for you I do have a lot of scarring from
acne<00:06:40.819> because<00:06:41.000> they<00:06:41.060> used<00:06:41.180> to<00:06:41.210> back<00:06:41.389> me<00:06:41.629> really

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:41.839 
acne because they used to back me really

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.050 
acne because they used to back me really
bad<00:06:42.159> so<00:06:43.159> I<00:06:43.219> kind<00:06:43.400> of<00:06:43.430> do<00:06:43.520> out<00:06:43.669> a<00:06:43.699> little<00:06:43.879> bit

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
bad so I kind of do out a little bit

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.119 
bad so I kind of do out a little bit
more<00:06:44.240> full<00:06:44.449> coverage<00:06:44.500> in<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.589> summer<00:06:45.830> time

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.519 
more full coverage in the summer time
I'm<00:06:46.310> definitely<00:06:46.699> more<00:06:46.879> of<00:06:46.940> a<00:06:47.089> concealer<00:06:47.750> and<00:06:48.050> a

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
I'm definitely more of a concealer and a

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.379 
I'm definitely more of a concealer and a
little<00:06:48.710> bit<00:06:48.830> of<00:06:48.919> powder<00:06:49.099> and<00:06:49.219> that's<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.759> so<00:06:50.360> I

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
little bit of powder and that's it so I

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.999 
little bit of powder and that's it so I
think<00:06:50.509> for<00:06:50.839> summer<00:06:51.139> I<00:06:51.379> really<00:06:51.740> like<00:06:51.889> this
