an indicator it has to be fuzzy so I've

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
an indicator it has to be fuzzy so I've
got<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> bright<00:00:18.150> red<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.630> made<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> glow

got a bright red one made out of glow
buggy<00:00:19.800> yarn<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.699> I've<00:00:20.850> soaked<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.390> silicon

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
buggy yarn that I've soaked in silicon

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
buggy yarn that I've soaked in silicon
and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> leader<00:00:23.570> right<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and then I have a leader right now I was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
and then I have a leader right now I was
just<00:00:25.500> using<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.130> using<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
just using one that I was using at the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
just using one that I was using at the
lake<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.570> less<00:00:27.660> long<00:00:28.080> enough

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
lake so it's more or less long enough

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.589 
lake so it's more or less long enough
although<00:00:28.789> normally<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.390> two

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
although normally you would have the two

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.560 
although normally you would have the two
flies<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:32.009> closer<00:00:32.219> together<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
flies a little closer together at the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.830 
flies a little closer together at the
end<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.200> 10<00:00:34.530> foot<00:00:34.770> leader<00:00:35.600> one<00:00:36.600> about

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
end of about a 10 foot leader one about

end of about a 10 foot leader one about
18<00:00:37.290> inches<00:00:37.469> -<00:00:37.860> flies<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.309> 18<00:00:38.670> inches<00:00:38.820> apart

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
18 inches - flies about 18 inches apart

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
18 inches - flies about 18 inches apart
weighted<00:00:40.200> nymphs<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> caught

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
weighted nymphs and the one that caught

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.810 
weighted nymphs and the one that caught
the<00:00:41.969> fish<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.530> tungsten<00:00:43.530> bead<00:00:44.250> head<00:00:44.489> nymph

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the fish was a tungsten bead head nymph

the fish was a tungsten bead head nymph
called<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> Cadillac<00:00:45.539> him<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> tied

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
called the Cadillac him that I tied

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.510 
called the Cadillac him that I tied
myself<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.719> idea<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.890> demco<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
myself so the idea is the demco to the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
myself so the idea is the demco to the
bottom<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.329> indicator<00:00:51.750> stays<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bottom the indicator stays on the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.430 
bottom the indicator stays on the
surface<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.210> I'm<00:00:54.210> casting<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> Reverse<00:00:55.199> where

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
surface and I'm casting in Reverse where

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.360 
surface and I'm casting in Reverse where
I<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.559> hook<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> cameraman<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I don't hook the cameraman here so the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.869 
I don't hook the cameraman here so the
current<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.230> let<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> drift<00:01:01.770> along<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
current and then let it drift along the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.810 
current and then let it drift along the
nymphs<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> bottom<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.820> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
nymphs will go to the bottom and the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
nymphs will go to the bottom and the
indicator<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.930> tell<00:01:07.170> me<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:08.250> something

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
indicator will tell me if something

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.370 
indicator will tell me if something
takes<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.790> how<00:01:11.790> much<00:01:11.909> lion<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
takes it how much lion I can get out you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
takes it how much lion I can get out you
need<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.950> amount<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.340> line<00:01:14.490> in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
need to get a good amount of line in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
need to get a good amount of line in
this<00:01:14.790> pool<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.020> right

this pool because you want to get right

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.510 
this pool because you want to get right
over<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:18.799> maybe<00:01:19.799> even<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.310> further

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
over there maybe even a little further

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
over there maybe even a little further
than<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.119> we'll<00:01:21.240> try<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.740> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
than that but we'll try that so I'm just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.679 
than that but we'll try that so I'm just
watching<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.400> indicator<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
watching that indicator now and if it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.370 
watching that indicator now and if it
suddenly<00:01:25.560> darts<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.299> I'll<00:01:27.299> strike<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
suddenly darts off I'll strike if it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.980 
suddenly darts off I'll strike if it
goes<00:01:28.560> under<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.070> anything<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.840> I'll<00:01:30.840> be
