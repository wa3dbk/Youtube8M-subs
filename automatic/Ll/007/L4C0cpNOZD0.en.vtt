00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.970 
animation stops but you actually do keep
fishing<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
fishing but there is a way that I do it
and<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.480> show<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:57.059> makes

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and I'm gonna show that now so it makes

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
and I'm gonna show that now so it makes
it<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> lot<00:00:57.600> quicker<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.829> still<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> bit<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it a lot quicker it's still a bit of a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.810 
it a lot quicker it's still a bit of a
pain<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> ass<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> works<00:01:01.219> basically<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
pain in the ass but it works basically I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.170 
pain in the ass but it works basically I
use<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> method<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.979> mouse<00:01:04.979> keys<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.909> if

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
use a method with mouse keys so if

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
use a method with mouse keys so if
you've<00:01:06.360> used<00:01:06.540> mouse<00:01:06.750> keys<00:01:07.020> before<00:01:07.310> you'll<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you've used mouse keys before you'll be

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
you've used mouse keys before you'll be
familiar<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:10.020> basically

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
familiar with all this basically

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
familiar with all this basically
what<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> ease<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
what you do is you go to the ease of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530 
what you do is you go to the ease of
access<00:01:12.840> center<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:14.030> control<00:01:15.030> panel<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> think

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
access center on control panel I think

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.429 
access center on control panel I think
you<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.650> Windows<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.900> have<00:01:18.900> no<00:01:19.110> idea
