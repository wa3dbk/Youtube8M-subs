the<00:00:37.050> pop<00:00:37.559> top<00:00:37.890> cap<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:39.469> kinda<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.649> that

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.380 

we'll<00:00:46.620> leave<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.610> much<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.210> wick

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
we'll leave about that much of the wick

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.619 
we'll leave about that much of the wick
out<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> push<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> pop<00:00:51.329> top

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
out then we're going to push the pop top

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
out then we're going to push the pop top
over<00:00:51.930> enough<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> pour<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> oil

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
over enough so that we can pour the oil

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
over enough so that we can pour the oil
in<00:00:55.250> now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> canola<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.140> use

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
in now this is canola but you could use

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.040 
in now this is canola but you could use
olive<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.890> other<00:00:59.190> vegetable<00:00:59.879> oils<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
olive or other vegetable oils this is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.229 
olive or other vegetable oils this is
not<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> place<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.070> using<00:01:02.430> gasoline<00:01:02.850> which

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
not the place to be using gasoline which

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
not the place to be using gasoline which
may<00:01:03.480> explode<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.409> kerosene<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.189> any<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> these

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
may explode or kerosene or any of these

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
may explode or kerosene or any of these
other<00:01:06.439> more<00:01:07.439> high-octane<00:01:08.040> type<00:01:08.640> fuels<00:01:10.490> we'll

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
other more high-octane type fuels we'll

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
other more high-octane type fuels we'll
need<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> let<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> wick<00:01:12.330> soak<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
need to let the wick soak up a lot of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.490 
need to let the wick soak up a lot of
the<00:01:13.950> fuel<00:01:14.220> before<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.330> lighted

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.170 

the<00:01:19.500> concept<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.130> lamp<00:01:20.400> goes<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the concept of this lamp goes back to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
the concept of this lamp goes back to
the<00:01:21.299> ancient<00:01:21.540> oil<00:01:22.049> lamps<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.340> as

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the ancient oil lamps that go back as

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
the ancient oil lamps that go back as
far<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> pyramids<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> probably<00:01:25.140> earlier

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
far as the pyramids and probably earlier

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320 
far as the pyramids and probably earlier
essentially<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
essentially all you do is have a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.080 
essentially all you do is have a
container<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.409> holding<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> liquid<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
container that's holding the liquid the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
container that's holding the liquid the
oil<00:01:30.329> whatever<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.960> might<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> wick<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> some

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
oil whatever it might be a wick of some

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.260 
oil whatever it might be a wick of some
sort<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> light<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:35.270> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sort and then we're gonna light it it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
sort and then we're gonna light it it
goes<00:01:36.479> without<00:01:36.630> saying<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> should<00:01:37.530> be

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
goes without saying that you should be

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
goes without saying that you should be
very<00:01:38.070> careful<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.270> open

flame<00:01:40.020> anywhere<00:01:40.740> inside<00:01:41.420> also<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
flame anywhere inside also don't use a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
flame is going to produce carbon
