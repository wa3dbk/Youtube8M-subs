magnet<00:01:19.810> manganese<00:01:20.530> just<00:01:21.310> an<00:01:21.430> interview<00:01:21.820> plus

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
magnet manganese just an interview plus

magnet manganese just an interview plus
it<00:01:22.900> has<00:01:22.990> fiber<00:01:23.320> protein<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.340> complex<00:01:24.520> carbs

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
it has fiber protein and complex carbs

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.810 
it has fiber protein and complex carbs
so<00:01:25.590> why<00:01:26.590> do<00:01:26.650> i<00:01:26.830> mix<00:01:27.070> wheat<00:01:27.310> germ<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.490> flax

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
so why do i mix wheat germ and flax

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.690 
so why do i mix wheat germ and flax
together<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:29.620> we<00:01:29.860> charge<00:01:30.130> has<00:01:30.280> less<00:01:30.490> fat

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
together because we charge has less fat

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.880 
together because we charge has less fat
and<00:01:30.940> more<00:01:31.060> protein<00:01:31.630> than<00:01:31.660> class<00:01:32.020> which<00:01:32.710> has

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
and more protein than class which has

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
and more protein than class which has
more<00:01:33.040> fiber<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.300> two<00:01:34.450> mix<00:01:34.690> together

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
more fiber so the two mix together

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080 
more fiber so the two mix together
actually<00:01:35.260> complement<00:01:36.010> each<00:01:36.070> other<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.880> make<00:01:37.030> a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
actually complement each other to make a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.900 
actually complement each other to make a

into jars like this one and I keep them

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.850 
into jars like this one and I keep them
in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.090> freezer<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> mixture<00:02:17.319> stays

in the freezer so the mixture stays
fresh
