this video if not check the description
but<00:00:12.660> anyways<00:00:13.080> I'm<00:00:13.920> doing<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> voiceover

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
but anyways I'm doing a voiceover

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.279 
but anyways I'm doing a voiceover
because<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.599> set<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.619> fret<00:00:16.830> set<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.220> fraps

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
because I set up a fret set up fraps

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
because I set up a fret set up fraps
correctly<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.010> captured<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.880> in-game

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
correctly so it captured the in-game

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810 
correctly so it captured the in-game
audio<00:00:21.869> twice<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.220> hear<00:00:23.430> an<00:00:23.550> echo

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
audio twice so as you hear an echo

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.560 
audio twice so as you hear an echo
whatever<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.380> ignore<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:27.240> anyways

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
whatever so just ignore that so anyways

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.529 
whatever so just ignore that so anyways
this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> crisis<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> demo<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:30.090> running

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
this is the crisis to demo it's running

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.430 
this is the crisis to demo it's running
at<00:00:30.660> 1680<00:00:31.199> x<00:00:31.380> 1050<00:00:31.710> i<00:00:32.390> believe<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.750> hardcore

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
at 1680 x 1050 i believe on hardcore

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
at 1680 x 1050 i believe on hardcore
settings<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> max

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
settings now i don't know that's the max

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.990 
settings now i don't know that's the max
i<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> max<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.579> settings

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
i think it's the max the other settings

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690 
i think it's the max the other settings
are<00:00:39.149> gamer<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> events<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.160> i<00:00:41.460> assume

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
are gamer and events so i assume

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760 
are gamer and events so i assume
hardcores<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> maxed<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.079> since<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> know

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
hardcores the maxed out since you know

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
hardcores the maxed out since you know
hardcore<00:00:44.129> whatever<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> pretty

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
hardcore whatever and this is pretty

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.750 
hardcore whatever and this is pretty
much<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.739> match<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.219> haven't<00:00:47.640> even

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
much my first match I haven't even

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
much my first match I haven't even
touched<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.239> game<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.570> check<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> controls<00:00:49.559> yet

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
touched a game or check the controls yet

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.010 
touched a game or check the controls yet
so<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.160> figure<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.840> walking<00:00:51.840> around

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
so I'm just figure it out walking around

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.330 
so I'm just figure it out walking around
you<00:00:52.289> know<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:54.649> I'm<00:00:55.649> pretty<00:00:55.860> sure<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.190> set

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you know and I'm pretty sure you can set

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.910 
you know and I'm pretty sure you can set
it<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.629> settings<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.620> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it up in the settings but I don't like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.299 
it up in the settings but I don't like
how<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> hold<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.320> right<00:01:01.320> right

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
how you have to hold the right right

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
how you have to hold the right right
button<00:01:02.699> mouse<00:01:03.059> click<00:01:03.390> button<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.199> order<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
button mouse click button in order to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.090 
button mouse click button in order to
keep<00:01:04.710> looking<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.909> iron<00:01:06.750> sights<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
keep looking into your iron sights you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
pretty sure could fix that with a few

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.560 
pretty sure could fix that with a few
tweaks<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> settings<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.799> runs<00:01:14.310> around

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570

I<00:01:30.200> think<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> second<00:01:33.150> one

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I think in this game in the second one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.800 
I think in this game in the second one
you<00:01:34.110> choose<00:01:34.470> between<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.689> it's<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you choose between two it's on the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.940 
you choose between two it's on the
bottom<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.259> consider<00:01:37.920> invisibility<00:01:38.700> or

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
bottom right consider invisibility or

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
bottom right consider invisibility or
armor<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.189> whatever<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.700> call<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.140> cuz<00:01:43.140> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
armor or whatever one call it cuz up

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.280 
armor or whatever one call it cuz up
yeah<00:01:44.299> what<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.390> whatever<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.930> know<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
yeah what or whatever you know just

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.760 
yeah what or whatever you know just
adapt<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.909> anyways<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.180> runs<00:01:48.360> around<00:01:48.740> 50<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
adapt to it anyways it runs around 50 to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620 
adapt to it anyways it runs around 50 to
60<00:01:50.340> frames<00:01:50.549> per<00:01:50.640> second<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.360> that's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
60 frames per second actually that's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
60 frames per second actually that's
pretty<00:01:51.899> impressive<00:01:52.310> well<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.549> bad<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
pretty impressive well I'm not bad for

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.899 
pretty impressive well I'm not bad for
crysis<00:01:54.840> 2<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.340> since<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.520> running<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
crysis 2 that is since it's running the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.080 
crysis 2 that is since it's running the
new<00:01:57.060> CryEngine<00:01:57.930> 3<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.060> little

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
new CryEngine 3 so I was a little

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
new CryEngine 3 so I was a little
surprised<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.770> pretty<00:02:01.860> good

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
surprised there so that's a pretty good

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.690 
surprised there so that's a pretty good
optimization<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.969> guess<00:02:03.950> but<00:02:04.950> yeah<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.399> dropped

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
optimization I guess but yeah I dropped

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.290 
optimization I guess but yeah I dropped
to<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.479> 40<00:02:06.930> frames<00:02:07.079> at<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> least<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.940> what

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
to maybe 40 frames at the least and what

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
to maybe 40 frames at the least and what
if<00:02:09.390> rats<00:02:09.599> running<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:10.379> recording<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.099> 30

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
if rats running it's recording at 30

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.440 
if rats running it's recording at 30
frames<00:02:11.400> per<00:02:11.580> second<00:02:12.030> so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
frames per second so

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.300 
frames per second so
yes<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.689> did<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:15.409> bad<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.769> just<00:02:15.920> match

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
yes I did pretty bad and just match

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.339 
yes I did pretty bad and just match
since<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.970> didn't<00:02:17.180> know<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.360> play<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:18.319> know

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
since I didn't know how to play you know

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.009 
since I didn't know how to play you know
so<00:02:18.970> you're<00:02:19.970> trying<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.209> figure<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.569> out<00:02:20.689> figure

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
so you're trying to figure it out figure

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.699 
so you're trying to figure it out figure
out<00:02:21.230> my<00:02:21.349> way<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:22.450> know<00:02:23.450> there's<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.810> killstreak<00:02:24.230> i

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
out my way I know there's a killstreak i

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.390 
out my way I know there's a killstreak i
believe<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.120> give<00:02:26.299> like<00:02:26.480> three<00:02:26.900> kills

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
believe so you give like three kills

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.860 
believe so you give like three kills
maybe<00:02:28.400> get<00:02:28.610> like<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> scout<00:02:29.150> or<00:02:29.360> something<00:02:29.750> or

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
maybe get like a scout or something or

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.850 
maybe get like a scout or something or
radar<00:02:30.110> i<00:02:30.700> believe<00:02:31.700> i<00:02:31.790> get<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.349> later<00:02:33.349> on<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
radar i believe i get in later on to the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.449 
radar i believe i get in later on to the
match<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.400> we'll<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:35.739> what<00:02:36.739> else<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:38.120> guy

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
match so we'll see what else this guy

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.619 
match so we'll see what else this guy
double<00:02:40.459> kill<00:02:40.579> okay<00:02:42.700> what<00:02:43.700> else<00:02:46.299> if<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.510> guys

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
double kill okay what else if you guys

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.390 
double kill okay what else if you guys
want<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> have<00:02:48.109> a<00:02:48.140> match<00:02:48.440> with<00:02:48.650> me<00:02:48.799> I'm

and so walking around so for the
interesting<00:04:14.220> lab<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.750> jump<00:04:15.990> pretty<00:04:16.110> high

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
interesting lab you jump pretty high

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.300 
interesting lab you jump pretty high
this<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.790> one<00:04:17.970> dude<00:04:18.950> he<00:04:19.950> goes<00:04:20.160> invisible

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
this is one dude he goes invisible

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.060 
this is one dude he goes invisible
buggers<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.970> see<00:04:21.150> him<00:04:21.239> i<00:04:21.360> don't<00:04:21.420> know<00:04:21.570> how

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
buggers to see him i don't know how

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.900 
buggers to see him i don't know how
reason<00:04:23.070> energy<00:04:23.820> runs<00:04:24.000> out<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.700> kind<00:04:26.880> of

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
reason energy runs out and it's kind of

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.790 
reason energy runs out and it's kind of
weird<00:04:27.150> how<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.960> don't<00:04:28.260> think<00:04:28.380> your<00:04:28.470> energy

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
weird how I don't think your energy

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.130 
weird how I don't think your energy
recharges<00:04:29.370> when<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.640> stand<00:04:29.880> still<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:31.020> in

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
recharges when you stand still it's in

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.780 
recharges when you stand still it's in
the<00:04:31.170> original<00:04:31.440> if<00:04:31.860> you're<00:04:31.890> invisible<00:04:32.280> you

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
the original if you're invisible you

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.270 
the original if you're invisible you
stand<00:04:33.030> still<00:04:33.270> your<00:04:33.590> your<00:04:34.590> energy<00:04:34.950> or<00:04:35.010> whatever

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
stand still your your energy or whatever

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.000 
stand still your your energy or whatever
recharged<00:04:35.730> automatically<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:37.010> energy

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
recharged automatically so energy

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.940 
recharged automatically so energy
depletes<00:04:39.380> even<00:04:40.380> when<00:04:40.470> you're<00:04:40.590> running<00:04:40.740> too<00:04:40.920> i

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
depletes even when you're running too i

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.270 
depletes even when you're running too i
just<00:04:41.010> noticed<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:44.150> that's<00:04:45.150> weird<00:04:45.390> i<00:04:46.280> believe

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
just noticed that that's weird i believe

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.750 
just noticed that that's weird i believe
i<00:04:47.370> die<00:04:47.430> faster<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.150> with<00:04:48.420> low<00:04:48.510> energy<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.380> i

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
i die faster to with low energy so i

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.960 
i die faster to with low energy so i
guess<00:04:50.760> no<00:04:50.790> run<00:04:51.060> around<00:04:51.300> too<00:04:51.660> much<00:04:52.850> this<00:04:53.850> guy

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
guess no run around too much this guy

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.580 
guess no run around too much this guy
has<00:04:54.090> thermal<00:04:54.360> mode<00:04:54.690> going<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.350> don't<00:04:55.410> know

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590
