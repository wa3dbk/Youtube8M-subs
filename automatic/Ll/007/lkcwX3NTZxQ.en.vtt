00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 never 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.440
 stand there 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.579
 deserted 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.799
 artificial and that makes frog and genuineness 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.859
 Well 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.039
 at the second glance you understand it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.349
 that the photos show a model 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 an illusion the paper and cardboard 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.210
 So this bus shelter from here drove the German band Tokio Hotel 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.150
 in the school building also applies to the fans 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.250
 The trained sculptor Thomas Demand has been studying the material since he was a student 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.910
 Paper fascinates 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.960
 if he replaces the advantage that is in everyone knows that we had to trust now 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.300
 Occurs even if you do not know why 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.920
 the thumb describes on paper anytime you participle picture and stuff like that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.400
 So all of these has early experiences to serve 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.450
 sure to use it again and again and I also try and stick with it and 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.280
 not to become too many things to do that you actually do 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 wanted to fight 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.300
 In his Berlin studio, the native of Munich works with Schere Kleber 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.620
 and paper follows the same principle 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.520
 Years ago, the first injured 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.760
 life-size construction of the motifs of press photos in paper and cardboard March 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.760
 Lighten the model that's what it means afterwards 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.730
 the photograph is his actual 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.230
 and directly from the perfect deceptions cartoonist for example 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.470
 is usually always in the background to easily visualize windows 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.450
 ours or will usually not go into it first 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.970
 how thick the table top is in relation to each other that there is one 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 Commitment to one expects to recognize and then recognize some of his los Biermanns 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.380
 you should just realize that it is just a certain type of close me 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.940
 all tables of this world or something and these 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.060
 Attention in Kiel to the details that is going through 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.180
 the picture convincing 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.670

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.250

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.640

 the kitchen of the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in his hiding place everything 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 made of paper 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 Thomas Demand's value is logically or politically significant places explosive 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.439
 World events that have burned into the collective memory 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.189
 his deceptively real photos challenge the viewer to think about them 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.179
 to the museum in other applicants are to recognize in the context 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.039
 we know because people are not protesting in South Africa anymore 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.789
 Life and you do not even know who it was 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.089
 And yet we keep the pictures even percent 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.749
 With a solo exhibition, he is still Modern Art 2005 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.019
 the successful German protour racing stable 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.939
 whether in galleries in London or at the Venice Biennale is Thomas Demand 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.939
 the star and his pictures achieve six-figure prices 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.919
 In 2007, visitors to Venice will see a model of his photos over 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.080
 Cited 30 tons of paper 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.739
 Thomas Demand speaks for the first time his previous rule 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 to agree the paper model after scanning 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.119
 when aware of the processes involved in the work of our 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.909
 Before entering the area, visitors had the opportunity to enter the 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.669
 to go to the pictures 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.049
 I have much more behind it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.059
 the Oval Office of the American President one of the most prominent 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.659
 Scenes of power 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.069
 The photo artist and his team are building in his studio in 2008 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.069
 within three and a half weeks the paper became 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.259
 on and obviously that did not happen is so unbelievable I know 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.700
 that you actually know it so well in and out of what you did 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.619
 for every kind of 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:26.729
 omission 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.369
 Add an abstraction or something will of course be read immediately when you're in 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.849
 Pretoria is the furniture and its performers of this dream in and 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.249

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.269
 When you look closely you can see the carpet is the Confetti Bern 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.449
 for the perfect drapery of the curtain in the Thomas Demand of

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:08.510
 PÃ¶lten I have to think about how to find a middle ground between fiction 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.399
 that of this room and cozy room 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.619
 for example, with the relatively small Chinese that I am glad that in 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.299
 the mailboxes project by Wulff 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.530
 Ing Kettwig aligning was based on that
