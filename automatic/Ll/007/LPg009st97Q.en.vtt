00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
on flick through the channels a little

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.640 
on flick through the channels a little
bit<00:00:49.219> ok<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.520> one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.130 

turn<00:00:54.310> this<00:00:54.520> on

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.310 

they're<00:00:58.739> both<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:58.950> one<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.450> few<00:01:00.809> seconds

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
they're both on one but in a few seconds

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.670 
they're both on one but in a few seconds
this<00:01:01.649> whole<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.130> will<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.489> blinking<00:01:02.610> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
this whole thing will start blinking and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
this whole thing will start blinking and
the<00:01:04.680> mic<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.159> incapable<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.850> working<00:01:06.030> as

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the mic will be incapable of working as

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
the mic will be incapable of working as
you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> didn't<00:01:07.619> click<00:01:07.800> anything<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you can see I didn't click anything the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.320 
you can see I didn't click anything the
mic<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.750> work<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.940> okay

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
mic will not work so you know like okay

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.249 
mic will not work so you know like okay
it<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:14.010> sinks<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.670> guess<00:01:14.880> you'd<00:01:15.210> call<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.509> no

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it just sinks I guess you'd call it no

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.600 
it just sinks I guess you'd call it no
but<00:01:17.040> uh<00:01:17.070> turn<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.160> connect<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but uh turn it on and it will connect to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.300 
but uh turn it on and it will connect to
to<00:01:22.909> flick<00:01:23.909> through<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.590> can't<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.950> back<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to flick through it can't get it back to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.630 
to flick through it can't get it back to
one<00:01:26.460> let<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.909> show<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:31.640> turn

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
one let me show you one more time turn

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.280 
one let me show you one more time turn
the<00:01:32.759> mic<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.149> first

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:49.560 

put<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.010> on<00:01:41.160> one<00:01:42.560> turn<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> control<00:01:44.100> around

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.160 

oh<00:01:49.630> yeah<00:01:50.470> they're<00:01:50.800> all<00:01:50.890> at<00:01:51.070> one<00:01:51.280> I'm<00:01:52.120> not<00:01:52.870> for

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
oh yeah they're all at one I'm not for

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.560 
oh yeah they're all at one I'm not for
long<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.970> will<00:01:55.300> not<00:01:55.510> work<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:57.040> yeah<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:58.060> guess

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
long it will not work so yeah I guess

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.750 
long it will not work so yeah I guess
we've<00:01:59.229> gotten<00:01:59.530> somewhere<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.190> little<00:02:00.400> bit<00:02:00.640> of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
we've gotten somewhere a little bit of

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.870 
we've gotten somewhere a little bit of
progress<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.950> finding<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:02.979> solution<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.850> how

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
progress to finding the solution on how

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.590 
progress to finding the solution on how
to<00:02:04.150> get<00:02:04.390> these<00:02:04.570> both<00:02:05.050> tour<00:02:05.380> together<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.600> this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
to get these both tour together and this

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.449 
to get these both tour together and this
also<00:02:07.869> happened<00:02:08.320> with<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> original<00:02:08.770> xbox

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
also happened with the original xbox

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.440 
also happened with the original xbox
headset<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:10.060> mean<00:02:10.240> xbox<00:02:10.990> controller<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:13.120> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450

work or original on subscribe I
hopefully<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.209> find<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.780> solution<00:02:26.290> soon

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
hopefully will find the solution soon

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
hopefully will find the solution soon
and<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.400> will<00:02:27.610> share<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.300> guys<00:02:28.360> all
