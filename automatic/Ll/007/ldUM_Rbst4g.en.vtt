 It is completely initial ability, but with meat guy power g Run power This is the speed of the foot 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.549
 Selling and running ability suddenly it was c 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.790
 And little wonder if let's do a little I'd g or Let's do this there are two 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.850
 In Well at beg doing that Let's try your left course to come this event 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.300

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.550
 After all my surgery 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.550
 It looks like the op is great 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.780
 Well, it seems to have succeeded in surgery 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.850
 And how 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.850
 It became controller s rank 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 Tsu Datte Ehen' child 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.950
 Even if you tell me to prepare 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.040
 I am a road author fielder. 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 Within me 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:00.319
 Well , I thought it was the initial ability that I could go up with 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:04.740
 If Kurere up any to another and Well including Well error avoidance meat power running skill how defense force 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:10.560
 If you think that it is good and try it as an omakase course for the time being 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:14.240
 What a surprise that the control has become s 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.890
 If you look at the ability improvement a little 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:24.900
 Well wonder if it's fully practice about something one body in is now initial capacity 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:29.520
 There is a little bit of points and if you make the pitcher basic ability up 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 Say this is I control learning already control s 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:39.620
 Stamina is 1 in the Well of course fielder why the ball speed is 120 balls 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:43.840

 Onakase course 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.780
 I should stop it for a while 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:07.790
 I would like like to say one to you 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 It is true that the success rate is high, but I do not know what the ability goes up 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.170
 There is also the possibility of becoming an unrelated ability 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.590
 Oh my little bit from next time 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.739

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:36.720
