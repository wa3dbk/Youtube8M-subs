00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.820

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.460
 You can do that even if it falls orange 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.920
 under it no action cards lies 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 with the light blue only you can card 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.130
 you have one particular player with you 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.830
 task 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.619
 everyone has up to four players 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.840
 players have their own tableau at more than 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.759
 four players you take one of the four 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.009
 existing panels from the stack and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.399
 partly the one of your choice of player 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.100
 on it then you put the new action 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.069
 task all panels are in use 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.200
 Do you take any tableau too 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.100
 of her even if you just got one 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 hate and partly with a new task to a 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.750
 Player of no more than a tableau 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.130
 be burdened 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 is played in a clockwise direction and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 whoever mixes the cards is allowed to start 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.610
 is it your turn ? 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.640
 do you see a card from the pile and lay 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.120
 one of your three cards on one 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.580
 corresponding field 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.709
 Now you have to play all the players 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:48.069
 to inform about the new situation 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:50.690
 this is why the new card is loud or 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.880
 Action cards always have to be both in 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.700
 combination can be read out 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.660
 Attention from now on, the new rule 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.820
 activated 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.010
 the game goes in the usual way 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.110
 order and direction continue 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.209
 Be careful which ones 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.370
 rules for who are valid 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.520
 it can even happen that until 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.950
 apply to three rules for a player 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.900
 each player contributes another 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.640
 caught a rule violation 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.730
 always press the buzzer 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.430
 here there is no order of play per 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.830
 So customer as long as a same player 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.910
 At the turn every player is allowed to play the buzzer 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.190
 only press once 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.680
 do you have the basterd do you have that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.230
 crusher his rule book concretely 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.150
 you hold one or even 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.460
 several players actually joined 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.960
 You can catch two broken rules 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.480
 advance fields 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.940
 did you get caught in the rule book? 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.490
 had a field back but never 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.580
 beyond the last field in the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.990
 Disputes are decided by the majority 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.970
 no majority is formed 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.190
 the game is easy without evaluation 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.110
 further you fit wrong 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.030
 or you can not break the rule 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.580
 you have to name a field correctly 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.530
 back is the card stack 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.270
 the end of the game will be the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.810
 used new and mixed cards 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.240
 ready again who is the first 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.360
 Zielfeld has won the game 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.010
 So get to the thing and catch your 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.010
