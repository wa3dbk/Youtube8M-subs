00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.830 
falling group blueprint of course it's a
falling<00:02:02.369> tree<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> need

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
falling tree and now we're going to need

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.499 
falling tree and now we're going to need
to<00:02:04.140> override<00:02:04.619> destruction<00:02:05.340> materials<00:02:05.850> these

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
to override destruction materials these

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.070 
to override destruction materials these
will<00:02:06.719> basically

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
will basically

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.350 
will basically
or<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.979> tree<00:02:09.250> will<00:02:09.460> basically<00:02:09.640> take<00:02:10.150> these

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
or the tree will basically take these

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.940 
or the tree will basically take these
materials<00:02:10.540> as<00:02:10.990> soon<00:02:11.200> as<00:02:11.320> it's<00:02:11.500> breaking<00:02:11.920> down

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
materials as soon as it's breaking down

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.750 
materials as soon as it's breaking down
instead<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.580> having<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.910> stand<00:02:13.090> there<00:02:13.210> once

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
instead of having to stand there once

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.840 
instead of having to stand there once
and<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.470> most<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.220> times<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.610> two

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and you most of the times it's two

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.020 
and you most of the times it's two
elements<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.680> want<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.310> trunk<00:02:21.760> first

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
elements you want to get the trunk first

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.150 
elements you want to get the trunk first
and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.050> leaves<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.680> we're<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:24.010> to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then the leaves so we're going to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.650 
and then the leaves so we're going to
search<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.610> same<00:02:24.820> palm<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.450> have

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
search for the same palm that we have

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.540 
search for the same palm that we have
here<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.710> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.040> big<00:02:27.280> palm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
here so it's going to be big palm

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.330 
here so it's going to be big palm
underscore<00:02:28.390> trunk<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.200> then<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.070> want<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
underscore trunk and then you want to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.580 
underscore trunk and then you want to
have<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.580> instant<00:02:31.090> material<00:02:31.690> instance<00:02:32.080> so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
have the instant material instance so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.710 
have the instant material instance so
next<00:02:32.860> we're<00:02:33.430> going<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.670> look<00:02:34.090> for<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> leaves

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
next we're going to look for the leaves

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.080 
next we're going to look for the leaves
which<00:02:35.230> are<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.740> Atlas<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.610> city<00:02:36.820> or

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
which are is the Atlas in this city or

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.990 
which are is the Atlas in this city or
in<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:37.360> case<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.280> we're<00:02:39.400> going<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.700> scroll

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
in this case and we're going to scroll

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.090 
in this case and we're going to scroll
down<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.870> see<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.470> low<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.890> cold

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
down and we see that the low and cold

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.980 
down and we see that the low and cold
distance<00:02:42.640> that's<00:02:43.030> basically<00:02:43.300> how<00:02:43.480> far<00:02:43.810> your

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
distance that's basically how far your

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.600 
distance that's basically how far your
trees<00:02:44.230> are<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.710> rendered<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
trees are going to be rendered in the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.550 
trees are going to be rendered in the
game<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:46.240> hundred<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.660> fifty<00:02:46.960> thousand<00:02:47.470> on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
game it's hundred and fifty thousand on

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.240 
game it's hundred and fifty thousand on
this<00:02:47.950> one<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.000> tree<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:50.040> made<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> quick

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
this one on this tree I made a quick

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.400 
this one on this tree I made a quick
small<00:02:52.150> typo<00:02:52.630> there<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.970> last<00:02:54.970> or<00:02:55.330> we're<00:02:56.200> going

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
small typo there and last or we're going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.070 
small typo there and last or we're going
to<00:02:56.560> check<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.610> collision<00:02:57.940> no<00:02:58.510> collision<00:02:58.960> is

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
to check that collision no collision is

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.010 
to check that collision no collision is
for<00:02:59.290> example<00:02:59.680> for<00:02:59.830> bushes<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.840> have

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
for example for bushes and then you have

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.170 
for example for bushes and then you have
block<00:03:02.470> autumn<00:03:02.950> which<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.280> used<00:03:03.490> for<00:03:03.580> rocks<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
block autumn which is used for rocks and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.750 
block autumn which is used for rocks and
trees<00:03:05.020> most<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.530> times<00:03:05.740> use<00:03:06.010> block<00:03:06.520> all

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
trees most of the times use block all

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.640 
trees most of the times use block all
except<00:03:07.510> inverse<00:03:08.160> kinematics<00:03:09.900> also<00:03:10.900> normally

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that fans properties open that up

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.500 
that fans properties open that up

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.690 
because it will say receive or it will
ask<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.900> if<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.140> receives<00:03:20.590> decals<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.370> want

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
ask you if it receives decals you want

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.330 
ask you if it receives decals you want
to<00:03:21.790> enable<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.630> both<00:03:23.020> situations<00:03:23.340> what

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
to enable that in both situations what

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
to enable that in both situations what
that<00:03:24.489> does<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.940> if<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.239> would<00:03:25.390> hit<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:25.900> a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
that does is if you would hit it with a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.740 
that does is if you would hit it with a
rock<00:03:26.380> or<00:03:26.680> with<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> pickaxe<00:03:27.459> or<00:03:27.790> an<00:03:27.880> axe<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.600> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
rock or with a pickaxe or an axe that it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.780 
rock or with a pickaxe or an axe that it
would<00:03:28.900> display<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:30.420> impact<00:03:32.459> texture<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.640> it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
would display the impact texture on it

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.949 
would display the impact texture on it
so<00:03:33.880> if<00:03:33.970> you're<00:03:34.090> hitting<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.390> tree<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.690> always

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
so if you're hitting a tree you always

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.240 
so if you're hitting a tree you always
see<00:03:35.140> some<00:03:35.350> yeah

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
see some yeah

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.280 
see some yeah
cool<00:03:36.430> colors<00:03:36.790> pop<00:03:37.090> or<00:03:37.330> some<00:03:37.570> cool<00:03:37.840> texture

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
cool colors pop or some cool texture

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.430 
cool colors pop or some cool texture
popping<00:03:38.620> up<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.820> is<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> decal<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.110> if<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.350> do

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
popping up that is a decal so if you do

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.780 
popping up that is a decal so if you do
not<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.770> that<00:03:41.890> enabled<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.340> will<00:03:42.489> not<00:03:42.640> be

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
not have that enabled it will not be

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.670 
not have that enabled it will not be
showing<00:03:43.090> your<00:03:43.209> trees<00:03:43.450> which<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.350> not<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
showing your trees which is not the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.400 
showing your trees which is not the
intention<00:03:44.980> obviously<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:46.480> now<00:03:46.630> we<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410

here so it's not a completely long list
of<00:03:55.180> settings<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.720> we<00:03:56.020> can<00:03:56.170> actually<00:03:56.350> start

painting<00:03:57.070> now<00:03:57.850> here<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.510> course<00:03:58.690> our

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
painting now here we have of course our

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840 
painting now here we have of course our
brush<00:03:59.200> size<00:03:59.230> kind<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.070> speaks<00:04:00.310> for<00:04:00.400> itself<00:04:00.700> in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
brush size kind of speaks for itself in

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.490 
brush size kind of speaks for itself in
the<00:04:00.940> paint<00:04:01.209> density<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.959> higher<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.380> density

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the paint density the higher the density

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.600 
the paint density the higher the density
the<00:04:03.070> more<00:04:03.280> trees<00:04:03.640> or<00:04:03.940> objects<00:04:04.780> will<00:04:04.930> appear

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the more trees or objects will appear

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.009 
the more trees or objects will appear
within<00:04:06.610> your<00:04:06.790> area<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.300> now<00:04:07.570> with<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> high

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
within your area so now with a high

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.140 
within your area so now with a high
density<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:08.830> see<00:04:09.010> quite<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.459> few<00:04:09.700> trees

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
density you can see quite a few trees

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.120 
density you can see quite a few trees
are<00:04:10.330> popping<00:04:10.660> up<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.350> if<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.590> crank<00:04:11.890> that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
are popping up but if I crank that

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.090 
are popping up but if I crank that
density<00:04:12.730> down

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
density down

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.130 
density down
then<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.730> can<00:04:14.940> see<00:04:15.120> only<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.540> few<00:04:15.870> trees

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
then you can see only a few trees

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.930 
then you can see only a few trees
actually<00:04:16.380> appearing<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.130> area<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.550> where<00:04:17.790> I'm

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
actually appearing the area of where I'm

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.230 
actually appearing the area of where I'm
painting<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.459> what<00:04:20.610> that<00:04:20.790> does

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
painting so that's what that does

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.480 
painting so that's what that does
now<00:04:22.050> um<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:25.260> order<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.920> can<00:04:25.950> also<00:04:26.250> add

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
now um in order and you can also add

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.120 
now um in order and you can also add
stones<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.330> bushes<00:04:28.080> they<00:04:28.380> basically<00:04:28.770> work

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
stones and bushes they basically work

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.520 
stones and bushes they basically work
with<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.460> exact<00:04:29.880> same<00:04:30.090> concept<00:04:31.430> all<00:04:32.430> quickly

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
with the exact same concept all quickly

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.860 
with the exact same concept all quickly
or<00:04:34.530> what<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.370> also<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.760> pretty<00:04:36.330> important<00:04:36.780> to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
or what it also is pretty important to

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.560 
or what it also is pretty important to
know<00:04:37.020> if<00:04:37.320> you're<00:04:38.190> are<00:04:38.370> if<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.030> are<00:04:39.180> removing

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
know if you're are if you are removing

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.690 
know if you're are if you are removing
objects<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:40.710> hold<00:04:40.890> shift<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.490> you

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
objects you just hold shift and you

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.160 
objects you just hold shift and you
hover<00:04:41.940> over<00:04:42.030> them<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.570> they<00:04:42.660> will<00:04:42.780> instantly

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
hover over them and they will instantly

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.390 
hover over them and they will instantly
remove<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.470> do<00:04:46.620> not<00:04:46.830> have<00:04:47.190> your

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
remove but if you do not have your

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.590 
current object selected here if you have
it<00:04:49.680> disabled<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.280> will<00:04:50.430> not<00:04:50.700> remove<00:04:51.090> any<00:04:51.360> of

those<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.590> way<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:53.090> selectively

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
those that way you can selectively

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.270 
those that way you can selectively
remove<00:04:54.840> certain<00:04:55.260> objects<00:04:55.710> if<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.010> have<00:04:56.130> for
