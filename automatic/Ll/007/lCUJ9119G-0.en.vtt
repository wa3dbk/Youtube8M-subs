I come reviews today we got review our

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.530 
I come reviews today we got review our
case-mate<00:00:08.460> tough<00:00:09.000> get<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> tough<00:00:10.290> case<00:00:11.360> it's<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
case-mate tough get a tough case it's a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780 
case-mate tough get a tough case it's a
hybrid<00:00:13.019> case<00:00:13.230> which<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:14.309> made<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
hybrid case which is would be made of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.630 
hybrid case which is would be made of
two<00:00:15.000> parts<00:00:15.080> of<00:00:17.390> soft<00:00:18.439> silicon<00:00:19.439> part<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> hard

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
two parts of soft silicon part and hard

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820 
two parts of soft silicon part and hard
plastic<00:00:20.910> part<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> combine<00:00:22.439> together

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
plastic part then you combine together

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
plastic part then you combine together
for<00:00:23.400> extra<00:00:24.150> strength<00:00:25.519> that's<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.910> looks

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
for extra strength that's how it looks

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.420 
for extra strength that's how it looks
when<00:00:27.920> when<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> rice<00:00:29.279> that's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.000> packaging<00:00:30.539> on

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
when when I rice that's a packaging on

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.110 
when when I rice that's a packaging on
on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> case<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:34.710> case<00:00:34.980> may<00:00:35.219> say<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
on the case with case may say this that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.690 
on the case with case may say this that
is<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> hybrid<00:00:37.110> tough<00:00:37.620> case<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:37.920> ipad<00:00:38.460> users

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
is a hybrid tough case for ipad users

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
each impact or hard knock so that's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.219 
each impact or hard knock so that's
sometimes<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.680> think<00:00:55.710> i<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.280> it<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:04.220> that

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
sometimes i think i look at it is that

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
sometimes i think i look at it is that
okay<00:01:07.229> i<00:01:07.560> mention<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> hybrid<00:01:09.000> case<00:01:09.240> made

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
okay i mention it's a hybrid case made

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.830 
okay i mention it's a hybrid case made
of<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.710> parts<00:01:11.659> silicon<00:01:13.400> port<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.790> hard<00:01:15.540> shell

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of two parts silicon port and hard shell

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.940 
of two parts silicon port and hard shell
i<00:01:18.710> believe<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:19.890> come<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.580> three

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
i believe they come in three

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.859 
i believe they come in three
combinations<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.580> colors<00:01:27.799> let's<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> look

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
combinations of colors let's take a look

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.390 
combinations of colors let's take a look
so<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.990> come<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:32.360> black<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.750> pink<00:01:34.130> black<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so they come in black and pink black and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.270 
so they come in black and pink black and
green<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:37.310> white<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.700> light<00:01:39.570> gray<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> these

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
green and white and light gray so these

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.609 
green and white and light gray so these
are<00:01:41.340> three<00:01:41.490> color<00:01:42.030> combination<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> come<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
are three color combination to come the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.370 
are three color combination to come the
prices<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:44.939> fifty<00:01:45.360> dollars<00:01:45.689> not

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
prices are not for fifty dollars not

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
prices are not for fifty dollars not
including<00:01:46.860> shipping<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> let's<00:01:50.520> try<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> put

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
including shipping so let's try to put

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.410 
including shipping so let's try to put
it<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.590> ipod<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.850> everything

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it on on the ipod and see how everything

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.160 
it on on the ipod and see how everything
fits

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
fits

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.940 
fits
so<00:01:56.860> first<00:01:57.280> what<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.700> like<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.180> do<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.710> look

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
so first what I like to do is to look

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.630 
so first what I like to do is to look
for<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:01.020> sound<00:02:02.020> record<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.680> then<00:02:03.100> find<00:02:03.549> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
for the sound record and then find the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.679 
for the sound record and then find the
part<00:02:04.180> that's<00:02:04.390> much<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.979> q<00:02:05.979> sound<00:02:06.790> record<00:02:07.210> on

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
part that's much in it q sound record on

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.160 
part that's much in it q sound record on
the<00:02:07.960> silicon<00:02:08.440> part<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.819> he's<00:02:10.360> going<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.660> try

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the silicon part so he's going to try

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.520 
the silicon part so he's going to try
this<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:13.150> sleek<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.690> very<00:02:13.900> flexible

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
this in the sleek on this very flexible

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.910 
this in the sleek on this very flexible
it's<00:02:14.770> very<00:02:15.069> easy<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.280> put<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:16.500> no<00:02:17.500> problem

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's very easy to put it on no problem

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.589 
it's very easy to put it on no problem
here<00:02:19.890> that's<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:22.650> second<00:02:23.650> part<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:25.540> we

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
here that's a second part on and now we

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.059 
here that's a second part on and now we
have<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.050> do<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.440> same<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.720> hard<00:02:28.720> case

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
have to do the same with a hard case

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.330 
have to do the same with a hard case
again<00:02:30.069> I'm<00:02:30.280> now<00:02:30.430> looking<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.000> son<00:02:31.660> rocker

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
again I'm now looking for the son rocker

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.620 
again I'm now looking for the son rocker
which<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.550> right<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:37.269> where<00:02:37.510> it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
which is right here so that's where it's

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:49.949 
which is right here so that's where it's
going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> go<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.230> right<00:02:41.310> see<00:02:47.819> that's<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:49.000> tricky

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
going to go in right see that's a tricky

00:02:49.959 --> 00:03:01.819 
going to go in right see that's a tricky
part<00:02:50.230> starts<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:52.799> bet<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:53.980> back<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.350> go

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.710 

unlike<00:03:02.829> other<00:03:03.010> cases<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.790> not<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.299> will<00:03:04.450> not

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
unlike other cases is not it will not

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.449 
unlike other cases is not it will not
kind<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.140> snap<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.859> place<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.430> I

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
kind of snap in the place you that I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.780 
kind of snap in the place you that I
actually<00:03:06.670> push<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.390> down<00:03:07.570> into<00:03:07.900> place<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.670> it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
actually push it down into place but it

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.199 
actually push it down into place but it
looks<00:03:09.970> good<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.400> fit<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.760> very<00:03:16.510> tight<00:03:16.959> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
looks good the fit is very tight and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.710 
looks good the fit is very tight and
very<00:03:19.209> secure<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.180> first<00:03:22.420> thing<00:03:22.540> I
