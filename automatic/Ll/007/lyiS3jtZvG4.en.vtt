2013 to look at the new sync device and
so<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:11.000> table<00:00:12.000> device<00:00:12.389> essentially

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
so this is a table device essentially

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110 
so this is a table device essentially
you<00:00:13.080> can<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.620> there<00:00:13.910> has<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you can see it right there has a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.410 
you can see it right there has a
dual-core<00:00:15.420> 1.7<00:00:16.260> gigahertz<00:00:16.680> processor

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
dual-core 1.7 gigahertz processor

NFC and it features like screen bearing
4/3<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.890> setup<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
4/3 have setup right here so I have a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.370 
4/3 have setup right here so I have a
Galaxy<00:00:28.680> Note<00:00:28.920> 2<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.260> can

Galaxy Note 2 right here and as you can

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160 
Galaxy Note 2 right here and as you can
see<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:32.250> being<00:00:32.520> mirrored<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> display

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
see it's being mirrored to the display

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.830 
see it's being mirrored to the display
that<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.280> behind<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.660> can

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that we have just behind and so you can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.430 
that we have just behind and so you can
play<00:00:37.020> games<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.829> stream<00:00:38.129> video<00:00:38.430> content

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
play games you can stream video content

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
play games you can stream video content
and<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.800> very<00:00:41.309> responsive<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.180> even

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and it's very responsive so we're even

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.560 
and it's very responsive so we're even
angry<00:00:42.600> birds<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> let<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
angry birds up here so let me see if I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.459 
angry birds up here so let me see if I
can<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.870> both<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.890> frame

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.380 

so<00:00:50.039> there's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.910> delay<00:00:51.149> but

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
so there's a little bit of a delay but

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.110 
so there's a little bit of a delay but
it's<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.780> fairly<00:00:52.050> minor<00:00:53.000> obviously<00:00:54.000> if

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's it's fairly minor obviously if

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's it's fairly minor obviously if
you're<00:00:54.269> playing<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> first-person<00:00:55.019> shooter<00:00:55.469> or

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you're playing a first-person shooter or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
you're playing a first-person shooter or
anything<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.359> be

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
anything like that it's not going to be

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.600 
anything like that it's not going to be
acceptable<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.769> sorry<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.309> hard

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
acceptable I'm sorry it's a little hard

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.540 
acceptable I'm sorry it's a little hard
to<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.000> single-handed<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.839> can<00:01:00.960> see

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
to do with single-handed as you can see

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.750 
to do with single-handed as you can see
so<00:01:02.550> let's<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.659> we<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.870> okay

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
so let's get back there we go okay

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.010 
so let's get back there we go okay
so<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.050> little<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.770> delay

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
so a little bit a little bit of a delay

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
so a little bit a little bit of a delay
definitely<00:01:10.020> less<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.380> second<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.550> very

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
definitely less than a second so very

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.390 
definitely less than a second so very
short<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.440> has<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> screen<00:01:14.220> mirroring

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
short this has been the screen mirroring

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
short this has been the screen mirroring
feature<00:01:14.760> let's<00:01:15.390> take<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:15.960> some<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
feature let's take a look at some of the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
feature let's take a look at some of the
other<00:01:16.500> features<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.980> well<00:01:17.130> okay<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:17.760> so<00:01:18.030> now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
other features as well okay and so now

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
other features as well okay and so now
we're<00:01:18.300> looking<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> Android<00:01:19.170> interface

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
we're looking at the Android interface

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
we're looking at the Android interface
on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.980> TV<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.210> your

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
on the TV you actually use your

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.030 
on the TV you actually use your
smartphone<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.290> mouse<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.920> see

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
smartphone as the mouse as you can see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
smartphone as the mouse as you can see
right<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.880> touchpad<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
right here and so this is touchpad to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.200 
right here and so this is touchpad to
touchpad<00:01:25.320> mode<00:01:25.560> let<00:01:26.550> me<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:26.910> here<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
touchpad mode let me get down here a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.310 
touchpad mode let me get down here a
little<00:01:27.300> bit<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.230> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
little bit so that you can see it in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.040 
little bit so that you can see it in
action<00:01:28.580> now<00:01:29.580> this<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.940> remote<00:01:30.300> Mouse<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
action now this is remote Mouse and so

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
action now this is remote Mouse and so
for<00:01:31.200> remote<00:01:31.440> Mouse<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.640> move<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> device

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
for remote Mouse you move the device

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.500 
for remote Mouse you move the device
physically<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> uses<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:36.060> accelerometer

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
physically so it uses the accelerometer

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.370 
physically so it uses the accelerometer
to<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.160> mouse<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.300> screen<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to move the mouse on the screen so you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.400 
to move the mouse on the screen so you
kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> use<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.980> touchpad<00:01:42.080> which<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:43.230> saw

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
kind of use the touchpad which we saw

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.370 
kind of use the touchpad which we saw
just<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> moment<00:01:44.010> ago<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.370> there

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
just a moment ago right there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170 
just a moment ago right there
we<00:01:46.860> use<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> touchpad<00:01:47.340> there<00:01:47.760> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> device

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
we use the touchpad there on the device

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
we use the touchpad there on the device
or<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> remote<00:01:49.259> mouse<00:01:49.530> feature

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
or you can use the remote mouse feature

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.280 
or you can use the remote mouse feature
which<00:01:50.909> seems<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.240> work<00:01:51.509> pretty<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.990> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
which seems to work pretty well it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.140 
which seems to work pretty well it's
pretty<00:01:52.409> responsive<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> tap<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
pretty responsive can you tap the
