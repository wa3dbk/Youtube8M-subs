 hi i am a nasa scientist jim garvin today 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.259
 would like to share with you one of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.210
 most stunning callers 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.640
 memories pictures of the universe which 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.640
 ever done and these are my top shots 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.879
 today we go to the moon to 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.360
 View pictures taken l lesson 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.670
 orbital reconnaissance in 2009 lesson 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.500
 engaged in mapping the moon and here 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.500
 five of my favorite pictures 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.489
 number five aristarchus see reaction here 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.000
 Mother Nature on the cosmic 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.589
 collision impact crater on this 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.259
 image shows about five kilometers 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.820
 relief the internal wall slopes in this 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.100
 giant shock punishers were 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.270
 ejected from inside the lunar crust which 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 Mother Nature is here for the first time 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 arranged solar system go to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.319
 number 4 lunar south pole on this 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.659
 picture you see perhaps the coldest 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.159
 place in the solar system in the shadows 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.800
 craters that you see here 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.220
 temperatures can be below 25 degrees 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.020
 kelvin is colder than on pluto on this 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.300
 in the picture we also see places that 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.490
 hide the remains of ancient ice frozen 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.130
 in this part of the solar system are billions 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.259
 years ago number three lunar emissions 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.909
 The material in this snapshot is reminiscent 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.579
 abstract art is visible process 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.950
 shock mapping of the moon's surface 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.780
 her young age this beautiful shot 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 shows us how dust and rocks 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.740
 moved or knocked out by this 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.350
 process as they are distributed by 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.840
 moon surface this beautiful shot 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.960
 shows us how this process works 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.660
 in the whole solar system number two 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.209
 lunar tunnel is very characteristic 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.950
 picture we see that such pits show 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.530
 process of destruction of the lunar crust 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 possible destruction of punishment over ancient 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.910
 the river of glory that flowed on the moon very 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 long led to the formation of tunnels under 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 the surface of the moon 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 such a snapshot offers us to study 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.430
 in the future completely new conditions on 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.890
 the moon and the first shot 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 the crater is quietly formed when 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.299
 colossal cosmic collision in 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.829
 dinosaur times on earth if 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.750
 zoom in picture can be seen 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.819
 the consequences of this blow 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.340
 who created a mountain of five kilometers 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.360
 tall is the largest impact crater in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.370
 land system 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.990
 on on top of that slide are 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.230
 giant rocks the size of a house 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.270
 discarded on impact 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.850
 this is mother nature at its best 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.890
 manifestation 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.760
 these were my top hotel rock shots with you 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.760
