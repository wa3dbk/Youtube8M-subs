00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.490 
love Magus XLR and honestly nitpicking
is<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.000> only<00:03:52.300> way<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> give<00:03:52.780> each<00:03:52.930> episode<00:03:53.470> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
is the only way to give each episode a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.620 
is the only way to give each episode a
different<00:03:53.920> score<00:03:54.370> if<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.910> rating<00:03:55.239> seems<00:03:55.480> a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
different score if the rating seems a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.750 
different score if the rating seems a
little<00:03:55.750> low<00:03:56.080> it's<00:03:56.410> only<00:03:56.620> because<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.190> how<00:03:57.459> high

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
little low it's only because of how high

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.540 
little low it's only because of how high
the<00:03:57.790> bar<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.390> set<00:03:58.630> by<00:03:58.840> other<00:03:59.080> episodes<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.220> you

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
the bar is set by other episodes and you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.910 
the bar is set by other episodes and you
know<00:04:00.760> oddly<00:04:01.300> enough<00:04:01.660> this<00:04:02.319> seems<00:04:02.590> like<00:04:02.709> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
know oddly enough this seems like the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.770 
know oddly enough this seems like the
kind<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.250> thing<00:04:03.459> Michael<00:04:03.819> Bay<00:04:04.060> would<00:04:04.090> make<00:04:04.540> if
