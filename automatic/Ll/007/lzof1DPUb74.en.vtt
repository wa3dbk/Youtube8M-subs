00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.920
 people have been drinking since ancient times 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.379
 coffee 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.490
 Since 1988 there is fair trade 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.130
 certified coffee and now in 2013 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.690
 we are launching fair trade climate neutral 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 coffee coffee is originally from 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.710
 ethiopia where it grows under trees that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.180
 give the shrub the necessary shade 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.180
 but those trees are disappearing rapidly 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 people cook on fire and keep open 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 mining forest to be able to get new land 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 edit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.640
 if this continues, there will be 25 years 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.640
 no more forest left 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 in the meantime, humanity remains too much 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 co2 emits climate change that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.610
 the consequence of this is large 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 consequences for the coffee farmers 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.500
 ethiopia are coffee bushes 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 extremely sensitive to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 temperature rise 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.920
 with a degree of temperature rise 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.199
 the coffee completely different at 2 degrees 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 there is much less yield and at 3 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 degrees in temperature has the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.040
 coffee bush even struggled to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 survive 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 it is certainly not far although the poorest 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.830
 countries contribute the least to the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 emission of greenhouse gasses 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.119
 they experience the most problems 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 of these in particular small-scale farmers 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.580
 are hit hard to help these farmers 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.030
 supporting is fair trade scratching 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.340
 partnership 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 that starts with a coffee bunch program 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.150
 for the benefit of 30,000 farmers who are members 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.860
 are from a fair trade coffee 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.860
 organization in ethiopia 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.740
 as part of this 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.409
 cookers spread out that much less 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.470
 use wood for the new trees 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.600
 planted and got coffee farmers 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.880
 training to make efficient use 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 of existing agricultural land 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 all this to preserve the forest 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.320
 and help farmers get more income that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 is clear 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.210
 but now it is even more interesting by 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.159
 these activities 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.009
 becomes the amount of CO2 in the air 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.739
 reduced and this yielded coffee farmers 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.819
 so-called allowances on those 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.380
 allowances 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.950
 are available for the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.860
 coffee roaster further down the coffee chain 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
 and the coffee roaster that compensates with 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.360
 the purchase of allowances 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.880
 are already minimized CO2 emissions 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.569
 this makes his coffee climate neutral 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.569
 produced 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.970
 the coffee farmers in ethiopia get one 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.040
 fair price for allowances and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.480
 the sale therefore provides extra income 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.579
 for them 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.709
 but we are not there yet because 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.360
 we to half of all CO2 emissions 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.900
 in the chain takes place at the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.910
 consumption of coffee and that is just 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.500
 a fraction of our daily co2 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.180
 emissions 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.180
 that's why we appeal to you 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.019
 in addition to purchasing 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.140
 climate neutral coffee you can use the co2 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.579
 your organization's footprint 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.410
 you can then reduce emissions 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.630
 the remainder then compensate with fair ones 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.090
 allowances the more people participate 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.109
 the more income for farmers to the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.880
 source 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.500
 hot in most 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.720
 climate change 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.720
 join in and become a fair carmen partner
