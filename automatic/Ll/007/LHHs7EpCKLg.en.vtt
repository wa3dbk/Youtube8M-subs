Americas with us and we're gonna walk

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.029 
Americas with us and we're gonna walk
through<00:00:22.490> why<00:00:23.300> is<00:00:23.360> it<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:23.900> big<00:00:24.199> why<00:00:24.680> is<00:00:24.740> the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
through why is it so big why is the

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.250 
through why is it so big why is the
tunnel<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:25.550> maybe<00:00:25.760> driving<00:00:26.210> according<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.690> we

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
tunnel so maybe driving according to we

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.720 
tunnel so maybe driving according to we
needed<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.560> tunnel<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:27.949> be<00:00:27.980> longer<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:28.520> that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
needed the tunnel to be longer so that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.370 
needed the tunnel to be longer so that
it<00:00:28.970> would<00:00:29.060> fit<00:00:29.359> more<00:00:29.600> equipment<00:00:30.080> in<00:00:30.170> it<00:00:30.260> we

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
it would fit more equipment in it we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.170 
it would fit more equipment in it we
could<00:00:30.560> fit<00:00:30.740> more<00:00:30.920> soap<00:00:31.160> applications<00:00:31.970> through

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
could fit more soap applications through

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.119 
could fit more soap applications through
