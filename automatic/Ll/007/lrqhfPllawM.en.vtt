00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
at that time if I ever have a company I

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.079

want to do this for my company offer
this<00:00:35.300> opportunity<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:36.140> my<00:00:36.290> dancers<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:36.949> so

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
this opportunity to my dancers and so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.770 
this opportunity to my dancers and so
when<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:37.760> moved<00:00:38.089> the<00:00:38.150> company<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:38.660> at<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
when we moved the company here at the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.899 
when we moved the company here at the
Twin<00:00:38.989> Cities<00:00:39.350> that's<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:40.339> we<00:00:40.489> started<00:00:40.850> doing

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
Twin Cities that's what we started doing

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.090 
Twin Cities that's what we started doing
and<00:00:41.269> this<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.600> think<00:00:41.629> our<00:00:41.989> 19th<00:00:42.620> year<00:00:42.949> of

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
and this is I think our 19th year of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.250 
and this is I think our 19th year of
having<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.460> valley<00:00:43.610> works<00:00:43.850> project<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.629> think

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
having the valley works project I think

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.990 
having the valley works project I think
it's<00:00:45.379> important<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:45.920> develop<00:00:46.159> the<00:00:46.460> artists<00:00:46.909> I

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's important to develop the artists I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.610 
it's important to develop the artists I
don't<00:00:47.269> just<00:00:47.420> have<00:00:47.600> dancers<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.079> have<00:00:48.199> artists<00:00:48.589> i

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
don't just have dancers I have artists i

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.160 
don't just have dancers I have artists i
have<00:00:48.739> people<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.309> by<00:00:50.000> developing<00:00:50.210> them<00:00:50.870> in

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
have people and by developing them in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.950 
have people and by developing them in
all<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.949> ways<00:00:52.100> possible<00:00:52.399> i<00:00:52.910> think<00:00:53.180> they<00:00:53.660> bring

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
all the ways possible i think they bring

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.020 
all the ways possible i think they bring
that<00:00:54.140> back<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.100> work<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.579> i<00:00:55.760> then

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
that back to to the work that i then

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.150 
that back to to the work that i then
asked<00:00:56.210> them<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.510> do<00:00:56.629> for<00:00:56.840> me<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.890> it's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160
