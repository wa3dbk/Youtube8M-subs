 I read and this is here with one 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 occasion is quite particular 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.269
 singular as unfortunately you can see it is 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.030
 cerca riccardo pursues those who say hello 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 to all I asked recco to take 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.010
 facebook to assemble a pc 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 obviously paying it if you are dead 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.599
 if a fact he initially said no ai 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.969
 first arrived from far away before 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.110
 said okay and today later to decorate the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.540
 first question 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.219
 in short, I was enough 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600
 happy in short, initially he has me 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.010
 say 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.670
 looks like a neighbor to the state councils 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.710
 nicely behind google search 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 he answers because he is the fruit of his mother who 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 do too often have to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.559
 match with what then gave me everything 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 he says listen but if I came to you 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.469
 wherever my you would seem the pc has 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.510
 said why not, in short, everything is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.700
 offered to offered me this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.030
 3d possibility by bike and since a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 I like it he needs it we go 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.260
 I meet both needs 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 so here we are today for montali 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 the pc if this moment comes to offices 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.040
 i am very helpful follow here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 because he launched you before and half of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.729
 time to do it seems a pc then not 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.110
 otherwise parts after it will turn on yun 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.150
 fat was armed 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 I am not signed and nothing is all alone 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.329
 can't mount on pc then it 's ok here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.369
 can also be accessed with the cilento but if 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.750
 we are immediately what is inside 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.790
 this neighbor says why it is not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.790
 especially then 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:57.119
 then the three of a kind in the data itself 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.580
 I read a scout 22 the physical tones 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.780
 comedians that in winter then to the card 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:08.039
 mother is an asrock z77 the victims there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:17.100
 gave 4 net then we have the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:18.690
 processor is a table with 535 70k that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.150
 well he could see if it goes away 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.250
 even ten minutes does not have what there is then 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.140
 the sink is a food ip subject 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 therefore the fans were missing 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 important I had one in a word 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.269
 so you are compact in this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 heat sink to laptops that 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.360
 nicely the fans do not you 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.810
 put in you have to partner in parties 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.019
 that it is only this that is, he has seen that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.370
 two wings I know if there are these was 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.209
 created these things since then who is 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:54.329
 understand then we have the same virus 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:58.440
 too much maybe this gives me a few 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:03.000
 hundreds of a gtx thesis was the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.600
 version raises a pd repeats the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.430
 same thing 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.739
 then we have the processional feeder 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.209
 unci 600 it has been found in more 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.100
 short I showed a dispute 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.730
 700 but 600 limiter is more than that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.780
 sufficient 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:24.450
 if then the ram of the g.skill I frequent 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.040
 and the dress the frequency of 1600 megahertz 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.079
 are 8 gigabytes for two hands from four then a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.890
 minors a datum that goes from the contract 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:38.040
 original that shack how to approach 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:42.150
 the elector reader of limits a crap 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.180
 however 9 given in net the normal and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.180
 nothing is known, everything is also there now 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.890
 the black hard disk of your digital 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.549
 they are of no use 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.780
 now we always continue pc after 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.750
 we will end this eagle video when 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.549
 I hope to make it work there 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.549
 we see more black guys hello 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.820
 well guys we just finished 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.010

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.320
 success in fact here behind that 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.600

 PC is everything, etc. Bellavista practices 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.720

 everything explodes no 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:14.369
 on the day of g8 not broken to see why 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:19.409

 nothing since it's authority or who I am 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:31.559
 a Roman is that of having great ones 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.080

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:50.729
 I pray and now in order to save everything 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:52.769
