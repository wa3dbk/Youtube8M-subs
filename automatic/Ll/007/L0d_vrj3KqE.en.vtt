00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.070
 Look 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.070
 Water 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.500
 good afternoon and know how about how you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.810
 you find carlos the girl the girl 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 phenomenal growing a lot and coming to that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.779
 I solved some doubts 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 I wanted to know now that started 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.520
 walking should arrange some control if 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.530
 you need a control found that you 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.440
 your pediatrician must perform so that 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.870
 observe the way of walking is 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.699
 planned in the control of the year verify 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.559
 how a child walks because here he is 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.510
 when the small ones can be produced 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.729
 alterations that must be verified 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.670
 that's why I think you've gone through 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.199
 several stages in the development of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 girl you've gone through what 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.540
 we could say the classic booties with 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 a loser and what are these that I 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.729
 My show served to protect above all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 the child from the cold after the blows or 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.790
 trauma then from 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.010
 the 5 or 6 months onwards that are the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.110
 pre- crawling stage which is a material 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 also undoubtedly as you will see 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 very soft very flexible and that is a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.010
 transition to the other shoe that is the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.660
 hitting shoe 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.360
 efforts that you see so much in the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.850
 tip as back and then you have the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 flexibility of the points these are 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.730
 They found in the front skin and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 from here we would go to the shoe 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.360
 definitive truth or the shoe of the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.270
 of very breathable walking very 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.550
 open that also has the reinforcement 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 this later is higher so that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.320
 park your ankle completely, do not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 encompasses all can also help in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.510
 this sense in physiological footwear 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 that we have commented on the presence of 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.280
 templates of this type that has these 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
 stimulation points that you see here in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.590
 three areas and that would also help 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.359
 the formation of the plantar arcade 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.729
 how can I know if they have the 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.250
 flat feet are flat feet 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.700
 physiological up to 4 years old ie 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.519
 the absence of a plantar arch is 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
 normal that you do not have to worry if 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.840
 we see that the child leaves all the trace 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.580
 true or that supports on both the edge 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.549
 external on the inner edge is 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.700
 undoubted that the flat foot can improve 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.430
 when it really walks on surfaces 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.440
 roughened such as the sand on 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.200
 all in the wet flour on the shore 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.880
 of the sea or on general grass on 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.739
 grass that are uneven surfaces 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.200
 what materials are the most suitable 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.049
 for the most suitable footwear are 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.510
 as we have more or less seen what 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:47.220
 throughout these stages the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.150
 more flexible materials lighter more 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.230
 breathable 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.939
 of skin or tissue was actually 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.920
 fundamentally that perspiration is 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.079
 can produce especially taking into 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.540
 account also the duration of the day of 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.519
 children and how can I know if the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.250
 Her husband's shoes are big 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.069
 if this is to see it verify it several 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.769
 times throughout the life of the 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.170
 first years especially shoes for 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.090
 do not squeeze to avoid compressing the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.790
 template you can see the distance 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.250
 about 68 millimeters 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.530
 above truth or the thumb 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.540
 It can also serve you since it has 12 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.819
 months then we would practically be 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.889
 talking that every two or three months you should 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.200
 change the shoe until you get to 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.430
 the three years can already be every four 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.250
 months 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.650
 the sole is important the sole 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.049
 be a school that has grip because 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.879
 obviously also children the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.980
 sliding is one thing that you have to 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.080
 avoid 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.250
 very good now 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.250
 thank you very much for Carlos 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.480
 Do you want more 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.019
 in the Huesca
