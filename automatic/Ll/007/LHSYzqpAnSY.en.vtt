pop-tarts recently they're not commonly
available<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.350> Australia<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:04.890> decided<00:00:05.250> to

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
available in Australia so I decided to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.030 
available in Australia so I decided to
experiment<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.390> try<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.720> make<00:00:06.870> my<00:00:07.049> own<00:00:07.080> let's

jam you like I am using black currant
jam<00:00:45.420> mainly<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.910> wonderful<00:00:47.910> other

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
jam mainly because my wonderful other

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
jam mainly because my wonderful other
half<00:00:48.450> made<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> special<00:00:49.289> request<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
half made a special request for that so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
half made a special request for that so
I'm<00:00:50.700> putting<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.030> about<00:00:51.239> half<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.690> jar<00:00:51.960> black

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I'm putting in about half a jar black

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
I'm putting in about half a jar black
currant<00:00:53.100> jam<00:00:53.399> that's<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.510> 250<00:00:55.440> grams

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
currant jam that's about 250 grams

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.130 
currant jam that's about 250 grams
roughly<00:00:56.160> next<00:00:57.030> I've<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.660> dish<00:00:57.840> with

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
roughly next I've got a little dish with

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
roughly next I've got a little dish with
a<00:00:58.350> tablespoon<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> corn<00:00:59.850> flour<00:01:00.090> that's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a tablespoon of corn flour that's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
a tablespoon of corn flour that's
cornstarch<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.350> American<00:01:01.590> friends<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
cornstarch to my American friends and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
cornstarch to my American friends and
I'm<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.059> add<00:01:03.270> enough<00:01:03.629> water<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I'm just going to add enough water to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.640 
I'm just going to add enough water to
dissolve<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.830> maybe<00:01:05.040> about<00:01:06.260> two<00:01:07.260> teaspoons

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
dissolve it so maybe about two teaspoons

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
dissolve it so maybe about two teaspoons
roughly<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.390> stir<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> together

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
roughly and just stir that together

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
roughly and just stir that together
until<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:10.979> dissolved<00:01:11.869> ideally<00:01:12.869> this

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
until it's all dissolved ideally this

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.690 
until it's all dissolved ideally this
shouldn't<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.470> thick<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> should<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.369> thin

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
shouldn't be thick it should be thin

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080 
shouldn't be thick it should be thin
like<00:01:14.939> milk<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.680> add<00:01:16.799> enough<00:01:17.130> water<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
like milk so just add enough water to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
like milk so just add enough water to
make<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.689> consistency<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.650> looks

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
make it the right consistency that looks

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
make it the right consistency that looks
good<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.090> add<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
good what we're going to do is add the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.730 
good what we're going to do is add the
cornflour<00:01:22.290> mixture<00:01:23.130> into<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> jam<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.049> then

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
cornflour mixture into the jam and then

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.850 
cornflour mixture into the jam and then
just<00:01:26.070> stir<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.869> over<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.229> medium<00:01:28.680> heat

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
just stir it in just over a medium heat

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
just stir it in just over a medium heat
we're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> stir<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.030> until<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
we're going to stir this until the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
we're going to stir this until the
mixture<00:01:31.380> comes<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> boil<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
mixture comes to the boil and then just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
mixture comes to the boil and then just
take<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> off<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> heat<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.130> see

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
take it off the heat and as you can see

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.240 
take it off the heat and as you can see
it's<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.290> thin<00:01:37.290> source<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:37.979> but

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's this really thin source now but

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
it's this really thin source now but
don't<00:01:38.369> panic<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
don't panic what we're going to do is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.670 
don't panic what we're going to do is
take<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> heat<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> allow<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:43.020> jam

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
take this off the heat and allow the jam

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.700 
take this off the heat and allow the jam
mixture<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> cool<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> cools<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.409> corn

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
mixture to cool and as it cools the corn

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.210 
mixture to cool and as it cools the corn
starch<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.270> corn<00:01:48.479> flour<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.649> actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
starch or the corn flour will actually

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
starch or the corn flour will actually
thicken<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.659> beautiful

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
thicken this up into this beautiful

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
thicken this up into this beautiful
thick<00:01:53.220> filling<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> be

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thick filling and it's going to be
