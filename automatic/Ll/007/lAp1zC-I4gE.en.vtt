00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.840 
pretty nice I'll show you the graphic
there<00:02:58.830> was<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> hand<00:02:59.480> right<00:03:00.480> now<00:03:00.510> um<00:03:01.670> at<00:03:02.670> his

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
there was a hand right now um at his

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.690 
there was a hand right now um at his
middle<00:03:03.120> finger<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:04.100> don't<00:03:05.100> care<00:03:05.489> about<00:03:07.700> good

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
middle finger up don't care about good

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.270 
middle finger up don't care about good
booty<00:03:09.630> not<00:03:10.290> done<00:03:11.450> yeah<00:03:15.380> brands<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.590> checked

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
booty not done yeah brands I checked

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.610 
booty not done yeah brands I checked
because<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.760> go<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> grind<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.570> hits<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
because when you go to grind it hits the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500 
because when you go to grind it hits the
rails<00:03:19.890> or<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.299> going<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
rails or not this so this is going to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.590 
rails or not this so this is going to
stay<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.440> long<00:03:23.100> time<00:03:23.400> until<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.880> rails<00:03:24.390> on

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
stay for a long time until the rails on

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.140 
stay for a long time until the rails on
the<00:03:24.690> side<00:03:24.930> leaves<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:26.489> pretty<00:03:26.910> though

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the side leaves and it's pretty though

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.819 
the side leaves and it's pretty though
the<00:03:27.510> rails<00:03:27.930> are<00:03:28.109> pretty<00:03:28.440> um<00:03:28.709> spread<00:03:29.340> apart<00:03:29.670> so

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
the rails are pretty um spread apart so

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.140 
the rails are pretty um spread apart so
grinding<00:03:31.829> on<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> deck<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.850> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
grinding on the deck is going to be a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.539 
grinding on the deck is going to be a
lot<00:03:33.420> easier<00:03:37.160> pegs<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.870> went<00:03:39.870> from<00:03:39.989> an<00:03:40.200> MVP<00:03:40.769> to

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
lot easier pegs I went from an MVP to

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.080 
lot easier pegs I went from an MVP to
this<00:03:42.739> we'll<00:03:43.739> see<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:43.890> note<00:03:44.220> know<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.910> but

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this we'll see you note know that but

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.300 
this we'll see you note know that but
some<00:03:45.299> II<00:03:45.329> don't<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:47.239> I<00:03:48.650> actually<00:03:49.650> had<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:49.980> shave

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
some II don't so I actually had to shave

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.509 
some II don't so I actually had to shave
off<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> peg<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.540> get<00:03:51.720> her<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.900> there

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
off some of the peg to get her in there

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.520 
off some of the peg to get her in there
for<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.609> axial<00:03:54.150> fit<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.170> back<00:03:55.319> end

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
for the axial fit because the back end

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.390 
for the axial fit because the back end
is<00:03:55.680> why<00:03:55.950> does<00:03:56.190> crap<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:58.109> back<00:03:58.290> end<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.769> wide<00:03:59.069> as

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
is why does crap the back end is wide as

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.910 
is why does crap the back end is wide as

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.790 
shave off some line to get to work and I
don't<00:04:39.940> feel<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.180> buying<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.320> whole<00:04:41.590> nother
