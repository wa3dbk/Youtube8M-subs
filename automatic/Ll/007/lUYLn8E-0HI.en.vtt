over it let's move on and so I think

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.870 
over it let's move on and so I think
that<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> people<00:02:07.770> might<00:02:08.070> be<00:02:08.100> living<00:02:08.640> in

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
that a lot of people might be living in

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.780

I<00:02:09.330> never<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> bicycle<00:02:10.259> mode<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:11.550> holding

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I never got the bicycle mode by holding

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.250 
I never got the bicycle mode by holding
on<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:13.530> did<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.670> could've<00:02:15.330> what<00:02:15.930> should

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
on to what did what could've what should

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.860 
on to what did what could've what should
have<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.550> wished<00:02:17.940> had<00:02:18.390> happened

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
have what you wished had happened

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.020 
have what you wished had happened
holding<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> past<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.460> would<00:02:20.910> have

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
holding on to the past and I would have

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060 
holding on to the past and I would have
to<00:02:21.150> say<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.600> terms<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.110> releasing<00:02:22.740> your<00:02:22.830> power

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
to say in terms of releasing your power

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.130 
to say in terms of releasing your power
into<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> world<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.150> being<00:02:24.270> able<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.870> all

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
into the world and being able to be all

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.800 
into the world and being able to be all
that<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.100> were<00:02:26.250> meant<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.520> be<00:02:26.660> holding<00:02:27.660> onto

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that you were meant to be holding onto

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
that you were meant to be holding onto
the<00:02:28.050> past<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.710> one<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> biggest

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the past is one of the biggest

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360 
the past is one of the biggest
detriments
