00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.660 
open so it has a really little nice
gloss<00:02:24.900> finish<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> white<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.100> you're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
gloss finish to the white as you're

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.920 
gloss finish to the white as you're
gonna<00:02:26.820> see<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:29.300> yeah<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.510> that's<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.750> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
gonna see and yeah so that's what it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.190 
gonna see and yeah so that's what it
looks<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> inside

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
looks like on the inside

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
looks like on the inside
this<00:02:34.200> padding<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.740> here<00:02:34.950> isn't<00:02:35.550> too

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
this padding right here isn't too

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
this padding right here isn't too
squishy<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.050> guess<00:02:37.350> that's<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.620> it's

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
squishy but I guess that's what it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.240 
squishy but I guess that's what it's
supposed<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.750> here's<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> strap<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
supposed to be like here's the strap and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490 
supposed to be like here's the strap and
yeah<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.210> that's<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> adjustable<00:02:43.110> part

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
yeah and that's the adjustable part

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.610 
yeah and that's the adjustable part
where<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.100> adjust<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.610> your<00:02:45.620> neck

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
where you can adjust it to your neck

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.120 
where you can adjust it to your neck
height<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.730> how<00:02:47.990> yeah<00:02:48.990> how<00:02:49.200> long<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.830> neck<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
height or how yeah how long your neck is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040 
height or how yeah how long your neck is
I<00:02:50.250> guess<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.730> then<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> opening<00:02:51.780> port

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I guess and then that's the opening port

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.510 
I guess and then that's the opening port
right<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.560> open<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.340> put
