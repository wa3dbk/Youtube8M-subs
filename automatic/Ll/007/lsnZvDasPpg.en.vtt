that I have from Big Boss I have used

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
that I have from Big Boss I have used
some<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.720> outside<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> says

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
some of this outside and when it says

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.930 
some of this outside and when it says
expands<00:01:06.150> five<00:01:06.510> times<00:01:06.870> in<00:01:07.080> five<00:01:07.320> minutes

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
expands five times in five minutes

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.380 
expands five times in five minutes
it<00:01:08.940> does<00:01:09.150> expand<00:01:09.540> five<00:01:09.840> times<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:11.300> there's<00:01:12.300> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it does expand five times but there's a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
it does expand five times but there's a
whole<00:01:12.540> bunch<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.810> steps<00:01:12.990> missing<00:01:13.440> from<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
whole bunch of steps missing from this

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.500 
whole bunch of steps missing from this
point<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.520> point<00:01:14.640> basically<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
point to this point basically what you

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.030 
point to this point basically what you
have<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> spray<00:01:16.260> down<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:16.799> wet<00:01:17.010> it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have to do is you spray down you wet it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
have to do is you spray down you wet it
you<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> flip<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> over<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> got<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you got to flip it over and you got to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
you got to flip it over and you got to
pull<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> pieces<00:01:19.590> apart<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.580> they're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pull the pieces apart because they're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
pull the pieces apart because they're
stuck<00:01:21.120> together<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.720> compacted<00:01:22.320> pretty

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
stuck together and are compacted pretty

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
stuck together and are compacted pretty
well<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.370> while<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.850> expand<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> five

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
well so while it will expand to five

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
well so while it will expand to five
times<00:01:25.049> its<00:01:25.320> size<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.979> won't<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.370> it<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.580> five

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
times its size it won't do it in five

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.810 
times its size it won't do it in five
minutes<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.490> looks<00:01:29.640> like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
minutes and this is what it looks like

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
minutes and this is what it looks like
