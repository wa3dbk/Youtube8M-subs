i do can offer but the same time they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.310 
i do can offer but the same time they
were<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.890> pc<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.329> least<00:00:57.449> i'm<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:58.020> sure

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
were on pc or at least i'm pretty sure

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.069 
were on pc or at least i'm pretty sure
they<00:00:58.500> were<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:59.340> also<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.270> consoles<00:01:00.780> demo

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
they were then also the consoles demo

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.039 
they were then also the consoles demo
was<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.620> too<00:01:01.890> small<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:03.090> having<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
was just too small and really having to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.010 
was just too small and really having to
console<00:01:04.619> players<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.549> game<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.510> devs<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
console players on the game with devs of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
console players on the game with devs of
course<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:08.159> doesn't<00:01:08.490> show<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
course really doesn't show off the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
course really doesn't show off the
potential<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.540> planetside<00:01:09.960> 2<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
potential of planetside 2 at all and to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.649 
potential of planetside 2 at all and to
be<00:01:11.640> honest<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.420> should<00:01:12.630> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
be honest I think they should have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.200 
be honest I think they should have
really<00:01:13.229> probably<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:14.040> never<00:01:14.250> had<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.850> booth

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
really probably just never had a booth

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
really probably just never had a booth
there<00:01:15.299> rather<00:01:15.960> than<00:01:16.140> show<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.460> have

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
there rather than show that and I have

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
there rather than show that and I have
watched<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.450> IG<00:01:18.869> ends<00:01:18.990> hands-on

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
watched a little of IG ends hands-on

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.910 
watched a little of IG ends hands-on
gameplay<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.780> much

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
gameplay and they don't really do much

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
gameplay and they don't really do much
anyway<00:01:22.920> another<00:01:23.580> thing<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> mention<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
anyway another thing to mention is that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
anyway another thing to mention is that
all<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.409> said<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.159> over

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
all of what they said was really over

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
all of what they said was really over
the<00:01:26.610> top<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.000> sugar-coated<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:29.070> mean

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the top and sugar-coated and I mean

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
the top and sugar-coated and I mean
that's<00:01:29.369> okay<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.329> trying<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that's okay because they are trying to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
that's okay because they are trying to
advertise<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> ps4<00:01:31.950> players

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
advertise the game to the ps4 players

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
advertise the game to the ps4 players
but<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.049> revenue<00:01:34.350> isn't<00:01:34.799> just

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
but we know that the revenue isn't just

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
but we know that the revenue isn't just
from<00:01:35.220> camos<00:01:35.780> there<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.930> membership<00:01:37.770> plans

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
from camos there are membership plans

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.649 
from camos there are membership plans
that<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.520> give<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> an

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that can give you a little bit of an

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
that can give you a little bit of an
advantage<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.320> weapons<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> also<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.729> bought

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
advantage and weapons can also be bought

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
advantage and weapons can also be bought
by<00:01:42.030> station<00:01:42.420> cash<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.350> Higbee's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
by station cash which I think Higbee's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.730 
by station cash which I think Higbee's
forgotten<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> mention<00:01:44.430> quite<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> few<00:01:45.240> times

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
forgotten to mention quite a few times

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.550 
forgotten to mention quite a few times
but<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.149> as<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.479> say<00:01:48.780> they're<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.290> side

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
but as as they say they're all side

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260

two gigahertz I five furthermore it is

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
two gigahertz I five furthermore it is
worth<00:02:50.640> mentioning<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.240> all<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.840> videos<00:02:52.170> are

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
worth mentioning that all the videos are

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.220 
worth mentioning that all the videos are
taking<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.830> widescreen<00:02:53.370> TVs<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.230> personally

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
taking of widescreen TVs and personally

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
taking of widescreen TVs and personally
I<00:02:55.290> believe<00:02:55.380> in<00:02:55.620> an<00:02:55.740> optical<00:02:56.280> effect<00:02:56.580> because

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
I believe in an optical effect because

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.460 
I believe in an optical effect because
you<00:02:57.120> sit<00:02:57.390> further<00:02:57.600> away<00:02:57.840> from<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> screen

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
you sit further away from the screen

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.090 
you sit further away from the screen
it's<00:02:58.980> harder<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.459> notice<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> games<00:03:00.570> floors

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
it's harder to notice the games floors

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.290 
it's harder to notice the games floors
so<00:03:02.100> when<00:03:02.220> you're<00:03:02.370> looking<00:03:02.400> back<00:03:02.910> at<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
so when you're looking back at it you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.390 
so when you're looking back at it you
think<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.840> game<00:03:03.990> looks<00:03:04.110> amazing<00:03:04.709> like

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
think are that game looks amazing like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.920 
think are that game looks amazing like
when<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.700> used<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.090> console<00:03:06.540> games<00:03:06.720> like

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
when I used to think console games like

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
when I used to think console games like
halo<00:03:07.440> three<00:03:07.800> halo<00:03:08.100> 4<00:03:08.370> looked<00:03:08.610> amazing<00:03:09.030> but

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
halo three halo 4 looked amazing but

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.150 
halo three halo 4 looked amazing but
when<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.390> look<00:03:09.480> closely<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:10.080> them<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
when you look closely at them the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160 
when you look closely at them the
textures<00:03:11.700> aren't<00:03:11.940> very<00:03:12.090> good<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
textures aren't very good and the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.110 
textures aren't very good and the
Lighting's<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.680> covering<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.580> we

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
Lighting's really covering for it we

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.910 
Lighting's really covering for it we
can't<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:15.540> say<00:03:15.630> now<00:03:16.020> but<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:16.830> know

in general i think that ps4 players

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.289 
in general i think that ps4 players
should<00:03:40.920> be<00:03:41.040> hyped<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.519> game<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
should be hyped for the game it's a

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.600 
should be hyped for the game it's a
great<00:03:42.480> game<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.260> gunplay<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.769> there<00:03:44.100> it's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
great game the gunplay is there it's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.520 
great game the gunplay is there it's
combined<00:03:45.060> arms<00:03:45.510> everything<00:03:46.019> really<00:03:46.230> work

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
combined arms everything really work

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.650 
combined arms everything really work
it's<00:03:46.799> my<00:03:47.010> most<00:03:47.250> played<00:03:47.430> game<00:03:47.549> on<00:03:47.910> steam<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.510> I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
it's my most played game on steam and I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.090 
it's my most played game on steam and I
don't<00:03:48.870> think<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.049> go<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> day<00:03:49.440> without<00:03:49.590> playing<00:03:49.950> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
don't think I go a day without playing a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.670 
don't think I go a day without playing a
little<00:03:50.400> bit<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.170> doesn't<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.560> its

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
little bit not that it doesn't have its

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.039 
little bit not that it doesn't have its
flaws<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.510> think<00:03:54.660> when<00:03:54.989> people

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
flaws but really I think when people

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.810 
flaws but really I think when people
jump<00:03:55.530> into<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.040> they'll<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.489> getting<00:03:56.610> a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
jump into this so they'll be getting a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.630 
jump into this so they'll be getting a
good<00:03:57.030> experience<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.830> honestly<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.220> one

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
good experience and it honestly is one

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.890 
good experience and it honestly is one
of<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.820> kind<00:04:00.090> which<00:04:00.330> they're<00:04:00.510> taught<00:04:00.750> of

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
of a kind which they're taught of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.320 
of a kind which they're taught of
selling<00:04:01.519> there's<00:04:02.519> nothing<00:04:02.640> really<00:04:02.940> out<00:04:03.060> there

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
selling there's nothing really out there

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.360 
selling there's nothing really out there
for<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.660> epicness<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> constant

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
for the epicness and the constant

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.090 
for the epicness and the constant

some points however I think this is true

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.740 
some points however I think this is true
of<00:04:13.980> most<00:04:14.130> PC<00:04:14.610> players<00:04:14.850> when<00:04:15.150> they<00:04:15.180> complain

of most PC players when they complain
about<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.169> game<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.950> people<00:04:17.250> get<00:04:17.370> burnt

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
about the game is that people get burnt

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.150 
about the game is that people get burnt
out<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.600> they<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.930> play<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.169> much<00:04:19.560> like

who<00:05:04.620> farms<00:05:05.070> quite<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.370> bit<00:05:05.840> sorry<00:05:06.840> low<00:05:06.990> battery

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
who farms quite a bit sorry low battery

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.290 
who farms quite a bit sorry low battery
rinks<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.250> all<00:05:08.370> honesty<00:05:08.400> I<00:05:08.760> think<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> plan

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
rinks so in all honesty I think the plan

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.760 
rinks so in all honesty I think the plan
so<00:05:09.540> four<00:05:09.810> players<00:05:10.080> will<00:05:10.230> be<00:05:10.290> pretty<00:05:10.500> bowled

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
so four players will be pretty bowled

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.740 
so four players will be pretty bowled
over<00:05:10.890> by<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.220> game<00:05:11.490> as<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:12.060> was<00:05:12.270> when<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.480> first

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
over by the game as I was when I first

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.720 
over by the game as I was when I first
started<00:05:13.230> although<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.160> was<00:05:14.310> pretty<00:05:14.490> bowled

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
started although I was pretty bowled

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.030 
started although I was pretty bowled
over<00:05:14.820> by<00:05:14.970> planetside<00:05:15.540> as<00:05:15.720> well<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.140> joint<00:05:16.770> ops

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
over by planetside as well and joint ops

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.680 
over by planetside as well and joint ops
when<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.370> used<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.669> be<00:05:17.790> quite<00:05:18.000> big<00:05:18.330> for<00:05:18.360> its

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
when that used to be quite big for its

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.600 
when that used to be quite big for its
size<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:19.260> don't<00:05:20.100> know<00:05:20.160> if<00:05:20.220> any<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.520> remember

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
size I don't know if any of you remember

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.170 
size I don't know if any of you remember
that<00:05:20.940> game<00:05:21.120> part<00:05:21.570> 4<00:05:21.900> why<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.520> PC<00:05:23.940> player

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
that game part 4 why I as a PC player

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.840 
that game part 4 why I as a PC player
with<00:05:24.360> no<00:05:24.600> ps4<00:05:25.230> I'm<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:26.130> interested<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
with no ps4 I'm so interested in the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.240 
with no ps4 I'm so interested in the
launch<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.180> console<00:05:27.600> side<00:05:27.780> too<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:28.770> firstly

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
launch of console side too so firstly

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.190 
launch of console side too so firstly
hopefully<00:05:30.090> s3<00:05:30.419> profits<00:05:30.840> would<00:05:30.960> hopefully

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
hopefully s3 profits would hopefully

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.980 
hopefully s3 profits would hopefully
mean<00:05:32.010> more<00:05:32.310> money<00:05:32.490> spent<00:05:32.850> on<00:05:33.000> ps2<00:05:33.270> development

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
mean more money spent on ps2 development

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.960 
mean more money spent on ps2 development
so<00:05:34.650> maybe<00:05:34.800> we<00:05:34.950> could<00:05:35.070> see<00:05:35.250> more<00:05:35.729> content

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
so maybe we could see more content

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.090 
so maybe we could see more content
quicker<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:36.810> then<00:05:36.960> again<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.470> guess<00:05:37.530> they'd<00:05:38.010> be

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
quicker but then again I guess they'd be

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.040 
quicker but then again I guess they'd be
spending<00:05:38.460> more<00:05:38.580> time<00:05:38.640> in<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.060> ps4<00:05:39.330> stuff<00:05:39.780> too

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
spending more time in the ps4 stuff too

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.250 
spending more time in the ps4 stuff too
that<00:05:40.650> could<00:05:40.830> be<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.950> double-edged<00:05:41.310> sword<00:05:42.260> also

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
that could be a double-edged sword also

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.350 
that could be a double-edged sword also
it<00:05:43.770> might<00:05:44.130> give<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.400> game<00:05:44.820> more<00:05:45.120> longevity

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
it might give the game more longevity

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.960 
it might give the game more longevity
meaning<00:05:46.169> that<00:05:46.290> it'll<00:05:46.590> last<00:05:46.860> longer<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.580> it'd

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
meaning that it'll last longer and it'd

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.430 
meaning that it'll last longer and it'd
be<00:05:48.000> very<00:05:48.120> nice<00:05:48.450> for<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:48.810> game<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.020> go<00:05:49.260> on<00:05:49.350> for

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
be very nice for this game to go on for

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.890 
be very nice for this game to go on for
quite<00:05:49.530> a<00:05:49.590> while<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.100> quite<00:05:50.970> importantly<00:05:51.630> it

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
quite a while and quite importantly it

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.810 
quite a while and quite importantly it
brings<00:05:52.290> planetside<00:05:52.919> 2<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.400> forefront

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
brings planetside 2 to the forefront

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.610 
brings planetside 2 to the forefront
again<00:05:54.240> it's<00:05:54.780> really<00:05:54.990> fallen<00:05:55.350> out<00:05:55.440> of<00:05:55.470> the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
again it's really fallen out of the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.640 
again it's really fallen out of the
limelight<00:05:56.090> bore<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.240> III<00:05:57.720> hype<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.140> that

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
limelight bore this III hype and that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.380 
limelight bore this III hype and that
coming<00:05:58.830> up<00:05:58.979> on<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.190> ps4<00:05:59.430> might<00:05:59.880> draw<00:06:00.120> more

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
coming up on the ps4 might draw more

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.600 
coming up on the ps4 might draw more
players<00:06:00.630> back<00:06:00.930> from<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.229> pc<00:06:01.590> too<00:06:01.890> because

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
players back from the pc too because

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.430 
players back from the pc too because
they'll<00:06:02.729> see<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.150> be<00:06:03.270> like<00:06:03.390> oh<00:06:03.570> yeah<00:06:03.720> i'll

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
give that a go again because really why

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.050 
give that a go again because really why
few<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.590> servers<00:06:08.040> are<00:06:08.130> getting<00:06:08.370> quite<00:06:08.669> under

shouldn't<00:06:45.000> do<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.360> and<00:06:46.260> so<00:06:46.380> a<00:06:46.410> grief<00:06:46.770> as

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
shouldn't do it and so a grief as

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.340 
shouldn't do it and so a grief as
literally<00:06:47.790> spawn<00:06:48.060> camping<00:06:48.570> as<00:06:48.750> soon<00:06:49.050> as<00:06:49.260> you

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
literally spawn camping as soon as you

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.530 
literally spawn camping as soon as you
spawned<00:06:49.650> in<00:06:49.830> there's<00:06:50.699> a<00:06:50.760> haiti<00:06:50.970> lightning

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
spawned in there's a haiti lightning

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.750 
spawned in there's a haiti lightning
called<00:06:51.840> only<00:06:52.530> exploring<00:06:53.010> or<00:06:53.280> something<00:06:53.639> like

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
called only exploring or something like

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.879 
called only exploring or something like
that<00:06:53.820> and<00:06:54.210> he's<00:06:54.750> getting<00:06:54.870> killed<00:06:55.290> after<00:06:55.470> kill

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
that and he's getting killed after kill

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.800 
that and he's getting killed after kill
and<00:06:56.160> on<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.550> NC<00:06:56.850> spawn<00:06:57.210> which<00:06:57.419> was<00:06:57.570> pretty

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
and on the NC spawn which was pretty

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.110 
and on the NC spawn which was pretty
much<00:06:58.050> just<00:06:58.290> out<00:06:58.470> in<00:06:58.680> the<00:06:58.770> open<00:06:58.970> yeah<00:06:59.970> i<00:07:00.030> don't

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
much just out in the open yeah i don't

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.430 
much just out in the open yeah i don't
know<00:07:00.360> what<00:07:00.479> they're<00:07:00.630> thinking<00:07:00.660> there<00:07:01.199> to<00:07:01.350> be

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
know what they're thinking there to be

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.200 
know what they're thinking there to be
honest<00:07:01.710> although<00:07:02.310> i<00:07:02.340> don't<00:07:02.490> think<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.120> way

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
honest although i don't think the way

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.879 
honest although i don't think the way
that's<00:07:03.419> why<00:07:03.510> we<00:07:03.630> handled<00:07:03.990> it<00:07:04.080> afterwards<00:07:04.740> was

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
that's why we handled it afterwards was

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.890 
that's why we handled it afterwards was
a<00:07:04.919> good<00:07:05.160> idea<00:07:05.190> saying<00:07:06.120> they<00:07:06.360> just<00:07:06.570> two<00:07:06.690> seem<00:07:06.870> to

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
a good idea saying they just two seem to

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.350 
a good idea saying they just two seem to
deny<00:07:07.260> it<00:07:07.320> at<00:07:07.860> all<00:07:08.130> and<00:07:08.370> it<00:07:08.729> was<00:07:08.820> annoying<00:07:09.090> that

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
deny it at all and it was annoying that

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.969 
deny it at all and it was annoying that
they<00:07:09.419> backed<00:07:09.750> hilt<00:07:10.080> they<00:07:10.620> could<00:07:10.830> have<00:07:10.949> just

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
they backed hilt they could have just

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.800 
they backed hilt they could have just
said<00:07:11.280> we<00:07:11.550> didn't<00:07:11.880> think<00:07:12.030> it's<00:07:12.180> gonna<00:07:12.330> work<00:07:12.419> out

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
said we didn't think it's gonna work out

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.600 
said we didn't think it's gonna work out
but<00:07:13.110> no<00:07:13.260> they<00:07:13.470> just<00:07:13.500> said<00:07:13.740> now<00:07:14.340> we<00:07:14.400> couldn't

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
but no they just said now we couldn't

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.040 
but no they just said now we couldn't
get<00:07:14.729> it<00:07:14.850> to<00:07:14.970> work<00:07:15.000> even<00:07:15.780> though<00:07:15.870> they<00:07:15.990> were

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
get it to work even though they were

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.230 
get it to work even though they were
playing<00:07:16.289> pcs<00:07:16.740> against<00:07:17.100> the<00:07:17.220> ps4<00:07:17.490> S<00:07:17.880> or<00:07:18.120> at
