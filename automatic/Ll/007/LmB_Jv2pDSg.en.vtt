GTA<00:06:12.940> 5<00:06:13.120> online<00:06:13.300> because<00:06:13.960> my<00:06:14.259> my<00:06:14.409> this<00:06:14.710> might

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
GTA 5 online because my my this might

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.209 
GTA 5 online because my my this might
allow<00:06:15.129> Rockstar<00:06:15.639> to<00:06:15.819> have<00:06:16.539> more<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:17.319> don't<00:06:18.159> know

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
allow Rockstar to have more I don't know

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.940 
allow Rockstar to have more I don't know
it<00:06:18.610> will<00:06:18.759> allow<00:06:18.940> them<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.210> have

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
it will allow them to have

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.770 
it will allow them to have
more<00:06:20.640> leeway<00:06:20.940> with<00:06:21.300> things<00:06:21.540> they<00:06:21.660> can

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
more leeway with things they can

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.480

probably come out with since you know

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.160 
probably come out with since you know
they<00:06:23.610> have<00:06:23.790> more<00:06:23.970> control<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.510> the<00:06:24.630> market<00:06:24.960> but

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
they have more control of the market but

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.210
