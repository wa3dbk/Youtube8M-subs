00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
console like most of us have got either

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
console like most of us have got either
a<00:00:19.890> PSP<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.760> d/s<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.810> something<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.170> that

whereas<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> GP<00:00:23.550> two<00:00:23.730> exits<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
whereas with the GP two exits it's a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
whereas with the GP two exits it's a
games<00:00:24.660> console<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.350> designed<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.920> people

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
games console really designed so people

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.500 
games console really designed so people
can<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:26.430> their<00:00:26.490> own<00:00:26.670> games<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.210> because

can make their own games for it because
if<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.640> inclined<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.510> write<00:00:30.960> code

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
if if you are so inclined to write code

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.799 
if if you are so inclined to write code
and<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> sort<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> thing<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> can't

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and do that sort of thing then you can't

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450 
and do that sort of thing then you can't
really<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.079> anything<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:34.980> PSP

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
really do anything with the with the PSP

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
really do anything with the with the PSP
or<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.880> d/s<00:00:36.149> unless<00:00:36.540> you've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.809> lots<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
or the d/s unless you've got lots of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.500 
or the d/s unless you've got lots of
money<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.460> gp2x<00:00:38.850> allows<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> do

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
money so the the gp2x allows you to do

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
money so the the gp2x allows you to do
that<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.590> gained<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> will

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that and it's not just gained is it will

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
that and it's not just gained is it will

professional kind of operation but i'd

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190

into ones and zeros and getting excited

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.870 
into ones and zeros and getting excited
about<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.200> know<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.770> quite<00:02:25.980> cool<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
about it you know it's quite cool and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.090 
about it you know it's quite cool and
there<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.420> also<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.810> TV<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.230> point<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.890> yeah

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
there is also a TV out point in it yeah

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
there is also a TV out point in it yeah
yeah<00:02:29.370> yeah<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> mean<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.330> idea<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
yeah yeah I mean the idea is that you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
yeah yeah I mean the idea is that you
you<00:02:31.500> literally<00:02:31.800> plug<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.130> into<00:02:32.250> TV<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.910> it's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
you literally plug it into TV and it's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
you literally plug it into TV and it's
like<00:02:33.540> playing<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.870> normal<00:02:34.140> game<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> TV<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
like playing a normal game and a TV so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.760 
like playing a normal game and a TV so
it's<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:36.480> all<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> consoles<00:02:37.290> tend<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.680> do

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it's not all of the consoles tend to do

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.350 
it's not all of the consoles tend to do
that<00:02:37.890> sort<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.670> quite<00:02:38.850> cool<00:02:39.150> if

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that sort of thing so it's quite cool if

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.730 
that sort of thing so it's quite cool if
particularly<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:39.990> you've<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.260> kids<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> you
