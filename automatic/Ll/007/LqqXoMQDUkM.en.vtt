we have to be a more supportive back

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.759 
we have to be a more supportive back
into<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.220> nose<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.299> usually<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.500> case

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
into the nose and I usually in my case

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.550 
into the nose and I usually in my case
is<00:02:24.040> i<00:02:24.160> will<00:02:24.400> use<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.090> septal<00:02:25.569> cartilage<00:02:25.599> or

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
is i will use the septal cartilage or

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.789 
is i will use the septal cartilage or
even<00:02:27.220> cartilage<00:02:27.730> behind<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> ear<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.650> rebuild

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
even cartilage behind the ear to rebuild

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.000 
even cartilage behind the ear to rebuild
the<00:02:30.220> nose<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.730> opposed<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.299> using<00:02:31.620> graphs<00:02:32.620> such

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the nose as opposed to using graphs such

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.660 
the nose as opposed to using graphs such
as<00:02:33.190> silicon<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:34.030> believe<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.890> person's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
as silicon I believe that a person's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.420 
as silicon I believe that a person's
politician<00:02:37.540> will<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:38.049> better<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.680> long<00:02:39.129> term

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
politician will do better in long term

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.619 
politician will do better in long term
and<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.180> will<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.540> more<00:02:40.780> natural<00:02:41.019> for<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> nose

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
and it will be more natural for the nose

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.080 
and it will be more natural for the nose
what<00:02:43.629> we<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.079> do<00:02:44.260> now<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.579> build<00:02:45.819> up

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
what we have to do now is to build up

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.460 
what we have to do now is to build up
the<00:02:46.120> nose<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.930> those<00:02:47.709> has<00:02:48.280> no<00:02:48.700> rich<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.959> is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
the nose and those has no rich here is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.890 
the nose and those has no rich here is
very<00:02:50.739> flat<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.940> kind<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.299> an<00:02:52.420> ethnic

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
very flat is it kind of like an ethnic

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.039 
very flat is it kind of like an ethnic
nose<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.250> tip<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.790> very<00:02:55.030> weak<00:02:55.359> what<00:02:56.019> I

nose and the tip is very weak what I
have<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.890> I'm<00:02:57.069> going<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.310> take<00:02:57.489> some

cartilage from inside and also with the
natural<00:03:00.549> cartilage<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.840> going<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.109> place<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
natural cartilage I'm going to place it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.879 
natural cartilage I'm going to place it
right<00:03:03.069> here<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.450> build<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.019> tip<00:03:05.290> this

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
right here and a build of the tip this

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.289 
right here and a build of the tip this
is<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.190> part<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.549> we're<00:03:06.790> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.060> remove

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
is the part that we're going to remove

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.030 
is the part that we're going to remove
some<00:03:07.859> cartilage<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:09.700> she<00:03:10.150> doesn't<00:03:10.389> need<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
some cartilage that she doesn't need and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.830 
some cartilage that she doesn't need and
we're<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> use<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.000> strengthen<00:03:13.690> this

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
we're going to use it to strengthen this

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.650 
we're going to use it to strengthen this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
is a revision rhinoplasty which is more

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.050 
is a revision rhinoplasty which is more
difficult<00:03:16.810> way<00:03:17.380> more<00:03:17.650> difficult<00:03:17.829> than<00:03:18.819> an

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
difficult way more difficult than an

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.490 
average one you're classy and it's more
reconstructive<00:03:23.709> work<00:03:23.859> rather<00:03:24.430> than<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
reconstructive work rather than just the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.920 
reconstructive work rather than just the
plane<00:03:26.829> will<00:03:27.130> be<00:03:27.340> moving<00:03:27.579> some<00:03:28.620> tums<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:31.690> is

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
plane will be moving some tums this is

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.740 
plane will be moving some tums this is
the<00:03:32.169> cartilage<00:03:32.980> graft<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.970> we<00:03:34.120> took<00:03:34.299> come<00:03:34.569> in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the cartilage graft that we took come in

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.890 
the cartilage graft that we took come in
here<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.560> nose<00:03:35.739> itself<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.579> you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
here and the nose itself and you

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.160 
here and the nose itself and you
sit<00:03:38.140> right<00:03:38.530> here<00:03:38.560> underneath<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.790> skin<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
sit right here underneath the skin and

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.470 
sit right here underneath the skin and
will<00:03:41.349> be<00:03:41.470> natural<00:03:41.950> because<00:03:42.099> it's<00:03:42.970> her<00:03:43.180> own

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
will be natural because it's her own

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.870 
will be natural because it's her own
apartment
