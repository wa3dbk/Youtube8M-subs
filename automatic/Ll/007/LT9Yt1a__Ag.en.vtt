 last league2 games a record 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.040

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.670
 of you dear surfers 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.710
 represents pile-hair 53 % on the same 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.110
 period eg apartheid clermont 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.840
 the little points 18 times beautiful 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.309
 surprises of this beginning of the season 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.260
 create the first opportunity with mana 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.510
 dembélé beautiful parade of paul delecroix 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.699
 dembélé again the free kick 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.079
 which passes just above the goal of 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.149
 niort also does not know what to do 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.100
 be worth the shot of florian martin just 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.100
 Above the goal of fabien farnolle 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.550
 the Clermont far more dangerous in 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:00.820
 this first period strikes too much 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.229
 crushed signed salibur also to untie 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.030
 believes by the way believes yet again 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.649
 put to use without great danger 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 by salibur here again 0-0 so 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.039
 at half-time a very pleasant match 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.930
 many opportunities to have the most 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.970
 frank for chamois niortais with 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.649
 a rescue on his line of jacques 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.330
 salze this is not farnolle who removes 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.000
 the ball 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.140
 the biggest opportunity for clermont 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.929
 exceptional relaxation of paul delecroix 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.049
 save his team the opener 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.920
 northerly clermont clearly dominates the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.330
 second period 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.860
 the first was for clearly the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.080
 second is clearly for chamois 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.679
 nice collective action and the typing of 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.479
 Simon Hebras is going to be superbly 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.729
 diverted by fabien farnolle 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.539
 we told you two games ds used 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.539
 in this meeting 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.759
 another draw for niort 0 0 the chamois 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.229
 king of points sharing ends up 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.110
 so logically in the middle of the ranking 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.890
 but still the last team still 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.890
 unbeaten in league 2
