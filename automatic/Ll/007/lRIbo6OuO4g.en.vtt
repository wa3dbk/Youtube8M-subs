it's going to have this is not going to
be<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> window<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.320> there's<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
be a window it's there's going to be a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
be a window it's there's going to be a
viewing<00:00:20.430> window<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.030> side<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.539> here

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
viewing window on this side right here

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.510 
viewing window on this side right here
and<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.280> entrance<00:00:23.610> and<00:00:25.520> it's

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
and this will be the entrance and it's

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.890 
and this will be the entrance and it's
going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.880> an<00:00:26.970> underground<00:00:27.210> hide<00:00:27.600> with<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
going to be an underground hide with a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.560 
going to be an underground hide with a
lid<00:00:28.170> probably<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.860> corner<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.430> a<00:00:30.000> lid<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
lid probably in this corner and a lid in

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
lid probably in this corner and a lid in
this<00:00:30.900> corner<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.560> open<00:00:31.860> up<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> hides

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this corner so you can open up the hides

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.149 
this corner so you can open up the hides
without<00:00:33.270> having<00:00:33.629> to<00:00:33.809> take<00:00:34.469> off<00:00:34.679> the<00:00:34.890> entire

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
without having to take off the entire

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.410 
without having to take off the entire
top<00:00:35.579> layer<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.949> carving<00:00:38.420> okay

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
top layer so let's get to carving okay

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.779 
top layer so let's get to carving okay
so<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.719> cut<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> big<00:00:40.289> plugs<00:00:40.589> out<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> spots

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
so I cut the big plugs out of the spots

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.469 
so I cut the big plugs out of the spots
where<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.979> two<00:00:43.979> highs<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.969> supposed<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> be

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
where the two highs are supposed to be

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.660 
where the two highs are supposed to be
I'm<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> save<00:00:46.530> these<00:00:46.739> pieces<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.399> cut

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
I'm going to save these pieces I cut

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840 
I'm going to save these pieces I cut
them<00:00:47.879> fairly<00:00:48.300> nicely<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.280> go<00:00:50.280> around<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.729> edge

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
them fairly nicely I go around the edge

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.450 
them fairly nicely I go around the edge
with<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.359> it's<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.379> easy<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> know

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
with this it's pretty easy to you know

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.840 
with this it's pretty easy to you know
sawed<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.199> styrofoam<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.609> going

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
sawed the styrofoam and then I'm going

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.489 
sawed the styrofoam and then I'm going
to<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.269> as<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.659> lids<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> hides

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
to use those as the lids for the hides

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.850 
to use those as the lids for the hides
later<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.549> second<00:01:02.940> layer<00:01:03.059> made

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
later when I have the second layer made

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.529 
later when I have the second layer made
okay<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> carving<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.640> done<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.390> can

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
okay now the carving is done as you can

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.469 
okay now the carving is done as you can
see<00:01:06.719> all<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> edges<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.939> nice<00:01:08.939> rounded

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
see all the edges have nice rounded

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.319 
see all the edges have nice rounded
spots<00:01:09.780> looks<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.469> more<00:01:10.649> like<00:01:11.090> rocks<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
spots looks a lot more like rocks and

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.539 
spots looks a lot more like rocks and
stuff<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.719> that<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.219> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.399> need

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
stuff like that so now I'm going to need

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.779 
stuff like that so now I'm going to need
to<00:01:14.670> start<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> next<00:01:15.149> level<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:17.159> make<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
to start the next level and then make a

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.359 
to start the next level and then make a
cutout<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.509> fit<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.890> one

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
cutout so these fit in one there one

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.209 
cutout so these fit in one there one
there<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.570> that'll<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.649> done<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> here

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219
