00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.460
 ah 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.690
 February 22, 2009 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.890
 My name is in the center of pain. 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.129
 its third generation 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.839
 of chile 2 born in rio grande do sul 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.879
 great-grandson of tomÃ¡s david olindo from italy 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'm on a vineyard 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.339
 the face to be more explicit 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.210
 and something that was 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 planted by my first generation grandfather born in Brazil 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 the citizen's name was the military vidor 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.460
 we can see here that we do not have a production 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.560
 something was collected 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.950
 but what I fall says lucky vineyard 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.480
 it's a vine of the variety 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 diogo isabella 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.440
 which was planted in the early 20th century plus ten to be more exact 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.000
 a thousand 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350
 905 approximately or 1906 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.580
 in case 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.340
 this kid kia 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.400
 quixad 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.820
 approached 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 approached with the passed 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 Are you Mr. Years old? 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.860
 and continues to produce 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 until this day 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.710
 the action 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 not with the youth record 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.430
 continues to produce 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 we have something still here but very little that she 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.510
 is enough 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.800
 the maturation of the era very fast 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.820
 and I could not 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880
 was done before 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.150
 we can already see that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.420
 by the beloved 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.180
 that spreads where I'm walking 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 it's the same plant 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.210
 and now they will try to take a walk 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 I was 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 I must be more or less at four meters 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.760
 sweet 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.480
 trunk and initial 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.830
 what was the number being 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 so therefore can we all feel here 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.759
 even with more than a century of life 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.779
 continues to produce 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.609
 and with a very good quality 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.259
 it's no coincidence that there's a box here 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.799
 ballet stage 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.099
 and it will stop 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.139
 inside the footage 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 is one of the last ones still in the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.610
 in said
