00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.899
 driver in vehicle using 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 telematics applications for example 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.140
 for emergency kools and for it 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.270
 record the weather and

 road conditions and driving behavior 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.259
 provide a lower claims but 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.910
 also for more customer contact 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.250
 led by day chairman rijnmond 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.930
 Reesink thought the visitors along 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.159
 possible opportunities and threats to the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 non-life sector 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.700
 what if for example as with god it 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.680
 google suddenly put itself on the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.720
 insurance market plunges the world 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.310
 changes and the bridge must change with it 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080
 today that is clear 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.670
 makes presentations that the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
 world is changing 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 you also see that there 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.189
 as a party on your own you 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 don't save you should go looking for it 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.950
 partnerships but you have to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.960
 especially look for it and you have to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.759
 ask yourself what would happen 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.990
 mean for me in the future because 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.460
 that we are the technological 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.890
 prevent development 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.509
 it is clear that this is exactly 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.400
 deal with the entire damage repair industry 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.640
 I also find that difficult to do that 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.259
 predict that ultimately 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 note that the number of damages 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.470
 that is gradually decreasing 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.479
 a trend that's been gone for a while 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.880
 And ultimately the entire industry will be there 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.409
 must also be prepared and especially 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.909
 think about how it looks for 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.020
 get me out in the future and i can 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.350
 following this day also whole 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.360
 well imagine the asking 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
 go univé in this case and maybe 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.690
 in general and in general to the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.790
 insurance industry 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.290
 and how do you want to deal with that, I 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.420
 think it is a legitimate question 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.040
 but that is not the question we are on 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.660
 currently already very extensively with silent 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.220
 have stood it could be so 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.480
 that from the industry itself from the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.010
 damage repair industry ultimately 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.480
 initiative is taken to contact 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.890
 to take with the insurer 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 to think about a form of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.430
 a business model that I absolutely exclude 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.350
 not out 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.610
 Case of the Pee-Pee Castle 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.010
 just during scissors 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.670
 seminar a presentation is about 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.730
 telematics where with ecole de 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.260
 insurer actually after the direct the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.550
 car can forward to the to the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.350
 damage repair 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.850
 yes you would say i think yes the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.690
 repairing damage will soon have nothing 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.780
 to bring in 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.220
 how do you see that I believe that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.060
 not 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.950
 because this new method also offers opportunities 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.680
 offers for the damage repairer 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.230
 to go directly to the customer 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.910
 and there to make sure that it is that 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.130
 bring in damage 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.079
 so did you actually say you would 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.610
 system and you should 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.280
 must ensure that you are going to recover 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.140
 are the ones that contact that customer through 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.670
 telematics with the customer 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.549
 yes i certainly would like me and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.030
 I would be a damage repair company 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.790
 every case 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.489
 seize the opportunities that are there and yet 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.530
 looks at how you directly at the 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.600
 customer can come to ensure that the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 harm comes to you and what you 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.640
 your first thought when you hear what's going on 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.170
 all is possible with telematics 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.180
 well my first thought we said 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.390
 years ago about a lot 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.420
 this kind of thing spoke but then again 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.609
 that that is what we are seeing now 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.040
 just really it is now and and more 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.570
 while it goes very fast and I believe 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.880
 also in development so what that 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.550
 concerns 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.520
 see him go so fast that it goes for it 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.950
 the people and and and also in the entire industry 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.550
 really big changes 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.630
 upcoming 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.220
 look at our fruit sector 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.290
 insurance case think that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.150
 you even more differentiated 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.890
 can offer insurance there 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.630
 I mean you like that a lot 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.100
 More information can get the of these 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.510
 as a person but to 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.000
 driving styles maybe ages 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 can adjust everything with your policy to that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.140
 certain target groups and types of cars 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.670
 their profession with which I am well then be 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.830
 target audience or car where you are 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.480
 premiums can sit a lot and a 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.340
 number of other factors 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.450
 to get premiums higher with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.020
 other words 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.260
 where the real damage block or too 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.760
 wiring the damage blocks are you 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.250
 that simply lets you pay more no more 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.150
 calculates over all the premium 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.400
 that gives 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.390
 within our industry and yes the decor it 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.190
 more chances 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.690
 marketing expert paul moers who like 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.610

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.310
 interpolis 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.200
 then go on a marketing master class 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.630

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.100
 successful and less successful 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.510

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.610
 the message and unique in what you sell 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.470
 his message was so selling and 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.060
 manager margarine at unilever no blue 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.590
 band but mother love 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 and of course you can get a higher one there 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.470
 price for questions 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.730
 it was the masterclass of oers 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.990
 topic of conversation during the 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.350
 casual buffet 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.720
 there were already had it about 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.430
 importance of a clear strategy but 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.440
 even more important what comes before that 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.680
 the importance of a clear identity that 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.080
 what kind of organization do you want to be 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.520
 which the customer will recognize yes 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.010
 and that also has everything to do with 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.780
 the kind of organization with will not be 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.760
 every customer will probably be there too 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.350
 immediately attracted 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.390
 Feel drawn there are the choices that too 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.050
 you have to make and be 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.510
 very important 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.040
 yes we are in all of them from abs 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.660
 we are very present 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.250
 also ensure that it is clear what is 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.910
 then your added value whatever you go 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.500
 offer 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.150
 yes then you will also be very simple and 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.860
 must be clear in you 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.240
 message to the market to the customer 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.670
 I think that man then of course 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.250
 We are also quite right 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.530
 Long a strong brand to build and 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.850
 puts the customer first and makes choices 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.410
 and then new came very clearly 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.820
 you want to make choices 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.920
 survive in this market 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.490
