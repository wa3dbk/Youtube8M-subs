00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.170
 straight and starts getting a little bit 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.090
 and little by little the same in my technique 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.580
 by state is an initial step and 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.770
 Pathological to cease the link between 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.570
 Easy 5000 in theory they make lose 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.570
