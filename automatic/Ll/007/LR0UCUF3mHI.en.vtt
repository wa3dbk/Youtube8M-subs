now depending on how tight you like your
snare<00:03:40.340> will<00:03:41.340> depend<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:41.790> how<00:03:42.090> tight<00:03:42.359> you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
snare will depend on how tight you

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.209 
snare will depend on how tight you
actually<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.140> make<00:03:43.319> these<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.890> both

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:44.219 
actually have to make these on both

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.660 
actually have to make these on both
sides<00:03:44.840> if<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.989> get<00:03:46.170> really<00:03:46.500> tight<00:03:46.739> with<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
sides if you get really tight with the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.160
