00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.680
 if the opponents are already hanging debuff from 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.340

 holy grail end of the game your build should 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
 look like this

 inflict permanent damage and spells 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.819
 deluxe are skill shots so the hero 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.709
 quite complicated to learn for new 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.110
 players but positives 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.280
 still outweigh the first one 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.980
 huge damage in a short span 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.079
 the second time is just incredible 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.120
 amount of control and the third is 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.000
 good shield that can not just save 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.829
