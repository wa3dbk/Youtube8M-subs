00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
even in amateurs and I think it'll be

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.910 
even in amateurs and I think it'll be
interesting<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:59.100> think<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.680> don't<00:03:01.680> necessarily

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
interesting I think I don't necessarily

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.520 
interesting I think I don't necessarily
think<00:03:02.250> Tim<00:03:02.580> will<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.120> well<00:03:03.330> yeah<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.440> I

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
think Tim will do that well yeah but I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.800 
think Tim will do that well yeah but I
think<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.830> will<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> new<00:03:06.300> challenge<00:03:06.510> yeah

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
think it will be be a new challenge yeah

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
think it will be be a new challenge yeah
it'll<00:03:06.989> be<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> new<00:03:07.290> challenge<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.130> create<00:03:08.850> some

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it'll be a new challenge and create some

it'll be a new challenge and create some
buzz<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.769> think<00:03:10.980> Timothy<00:03:11.340> has<00:03:11.489> everything

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790

I'm of the opinion that I think both

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
I'm of the opinion that I think both
Valerie<00:03:17.700> Alexander<00:03:18.269> would<00:03:18.390> get<00:03:18.540> crushed<00:03:18.720> by

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
Pacquiao I don't know I'm not sure if it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.180 
Pacquiao I don't know I'm not sure if it
would<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.420> competitive<00:03:21.900> Bradley<00:03:22.320> he

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
would be that competitive Bradley he

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.440 
would be that competitive Bradley he
does<00:03:23.370> everything<00:03:23.640> well<00:03:24.000> B<00:03:24.180> doesn't<00:03:24.329> do

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
does everything well B doesn't do

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.030

anything<00:03:24.750> great<00:03:24.959> same<00:03:25.200> thing<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.470> Alexander

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
anything great same thing with Alexander

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.039 
anything great same thing with Alexander
and<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:27.120> can't<00:03:27.390> wait<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.780> fight<00:03:28.019> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
and I can't wait for that fight to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.630 
and I can't wait for that fight to
happen<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.470> January<00:03:28.620> about<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> same<00:03:29.370> time<00:03:29.610> I

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
happen in January about the same time I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.039 
happen in January about the same time I
don't<00:03:29.790> think<00:03:30.030> either<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.239> puzzle<00:03:30.690> poses<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
don't think either one puzzle poses a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.870 
don't think either one puzzle poses a
great<00:03:31.290> challenge<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.620> Pacquiao<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.700> same

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880

country<00:03:50.070> eating<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.609> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.450> what<00:03:51.570> does

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
country eating and going to it what does
