00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.360 
duo Lane about the new Thresh I think
it's<00:03:05.419> he's<00:03:06.200> pretty<00:03:06.709> overpowered<00:03:06.950> right<00:03:07.250> now

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
it's he's pretty overpowered right now

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.490 
it's he's pretty overpowered right now
he's<00:03:08.359> pretty<00:03:08.720> much<00:03:08.810> picked<00:03:09.049> her<00:03:09.109> been<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.379> like

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
he's pretty much picked her been in like

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.580 
he's pretty much picked her been in like
every<00:03:09.739> game<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.900> just<00:03:12.019> gonna<00:03:12.109> put<00:03:12.560> a

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
every game and this is just gonna put a

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.899 
every game and this is just gonna put a
more<00:03:12.799> in<00:03:12.859> line<00:03:13.040> he's<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.549> be<00:03:13.669> good

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
more in line he's going to be good

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.509 
more in line he's going to be good
rather<00:03:14.299> than<00:03:14.480> overpowered<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.169> anna<00:03:16.129> i<00:03:16.280> still

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
rather than overpowered and anna i still

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.490 
rather than overpowered and anna i still
think<00:03:16.639> his<00:03:17.060> core<00:03:17.269> kid<00:03:17.419> is<00:03:17.569> insane<00:03:17.959> like<00:03:18.169> if<00:03:18.349> you

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
think his core kid is insane like if you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.319 
think his core kid is insane like if you
saw<00:03:18.680> how<00:03:19.250> many<00:03:19.310> players<00:03:19.579> we<00:03:19.760> made<00:03:19.909> with<00:03:20.090> just

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
thrash alone that going to happen if we

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.289 
thrash alone that going to happen if we
just<00:03:22.040> pick<00:03:22.159> like<00:03:22.310> Lulu<00:03:22.549> or<00:03:22.579> jana<00:03:22.909> or<00:03:23.060> something
