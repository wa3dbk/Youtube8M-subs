00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.830
 almost close to deer head at 47 meters 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.600
 in depth you can go visit 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.520
 the wreck of a German cargo ship has 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.810
 founded in the spring of 1943 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.340
 the dive is sufficiently 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.010
 demanding to be recommended 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.960
 Experienced divers the wreck is located 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.970
 perched on a flat expanse of 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.600
 sand and mud that keeps the hull in 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.600
 navigation structure 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.780
 certainly we know that it was requisitioned e 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.630
 adapted overlooking the warship of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.010
 German navy 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.290
 we follow the long top that from the buoy 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.530
 placed on the surface leads us to the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.480
 ship's deck often surrounded by 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.059
 good visibility conditions thanks 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.860
 in the presence of a slight current the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.729
 hull profile is already visible from 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.670
 stern to bow during the descent time 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.470
 background allows us to visit 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.060
 totally almost 70 meters long 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.060
 of the wreck for the nine of width 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.050
 the bow characterized by jaws 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.190
 rounded and covered with flora and fauna 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.140
 bentonica as the whole excavation 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.170
 in addition to oysters and sponges it has become 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.000
 home also of the elegant spirographs 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.370
 their presence has been betrayed for a long time and 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.230
 thin and flexible membranous tube 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.790
 branchial tuft that lazily yes 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.790
 let it rock from the current 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.990
 attention catalyzed only covered 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.600
 by the presence of a powerful arcane led 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 and very recognizable gears 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.759
 are now dominated by a myriad of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.770
 encrusting organisms every centimeter 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.230
 square sheet metal and been colonized 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.030
 there is no longer a vacancy for some 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.870
 body of sexes that wanted 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.870
 take root now 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.370
 in free water the carousel is 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.310
 characterized by the sinuous dance of the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.050
 red chestnut a very dense cloud 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.250
 which opens closes to ours 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.750
 passage 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.110
 the whole wreck wrapped around it 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
 we recover the blanket 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.090
 at some point it stops 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.540
 abruptly from my net backstroke e 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.209
 highlights the deep hold there 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.439
 we come closer, finding ourselves in the belly 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.209
 of the carmo on the forward side of the hold 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.209
 it is possible to try a timid e 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.459
 prudent penetration of the hull while 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.750
 the rest of the area is occupied by 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.750
 collapsed superstructures 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.790
 inside the basement collapsed 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.790
 what supported the armament of the port 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.200
 externally exceeded one of the two 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.220
 walled you reach the aft wheel ed 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.220
 also the maximum depth 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.880
 we go back to the stern deck 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.669
 superstructures apart little remained 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.009
 of the commands for the government of the ship 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.919
 the formwork of the engine room the cabin 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:28.870
 of command and finally the winches with i 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.870
 partially steel cables sometimes 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.009
 in this section more than ever sheets 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.810
 they are covered with colorful sponges and 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.810
 from many other fouling organisms 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.680
 here is the jewel anemone from the researchers 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.110
 life is defined there 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.909
 we approach further to appreciate 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.569
 the brilliant colonies that every single one 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.389
 poles can make you stand out chromatically 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:12.699
 the shades range from orange red 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.699
 passing through pink to green 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.979
 through the portholes of the formwork is 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.979
 possible to observe what remains of 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:32.460
 propeller before heading to the 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:34.740
 center of the ship to climb up the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.199
 wreck has turned into a great one 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.210
 oasis of natural repopulation the 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.729
 backdrop that surrounds it indeed is 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.639
 predominantly turned on and therefore absent 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.599
 life neo rock where to start giving life 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.599
 to the food chain
