alright<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:02.879> video<00:00:03.179> what<00:00:03.659> we<00:00:03.810> want<00:00:04.020> to

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
alright so in this video what we want to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.710 
alright so in this video what we want to
do<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.920> about<00:00:05.250> using<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.670> TI<00:00:05.970> 34

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
do is talk about using the TI 34

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990 
do is talk about using the TI 34
multi-view<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.710> convert<00:00:08.099> from<00:00:08.370> improper

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
multi-view to convert from improper

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.749 
multi-view to convert from improper
fractions<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.900> mixed<00:00:09.929> numbers<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.800> then

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
fractions to mixed numbers and then

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.419 
fractions to mixed numbers and then
again<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.389> mixed<00:00:12.719> numbers<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.139> improper

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
again from mixed numbers to improper

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.150 
again from mixed numbers to improper
fractions<00:00:14.570> so<00:00:15.570> I'm<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> assume<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
fractions so I'm going to assume that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.910 
fractions so I'm going to assume that
your<00:00:17.400> calculator<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.449> set<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.350> default

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
your calculator is set up in a default

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.599 
your calculator is set up in a default
mode<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:22.080> let's<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> check

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
mode but if not let's just kind of check

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.550 
mode but if not let's just kind of check
real<00:00:23.880> quick<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> do

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
real quick so what you would want to do

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
real quick so what you would want to do
is<00:00:25.890> click<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.970> mode<00:00:27.269> button<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.880> if<00:00:29.880> we

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is click the mode button and if we

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.350 
is click the mode button and if we
scroll<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:33.410> get<00:00:34.410> past<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:36.120> you'll

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
scroll down get past that now you'll

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
scroll down get past that now you'll
notice<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.890> says<00:00:37.920> u<00:00:38.910> +<00:00:39.410> /<00:00:40.410> D<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.160> that's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
notice here it says u + / D and that's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.479 
notice here it says u + / D and that's
the<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:41.879> highlighted<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the one that's highlighted and then the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.660 
the one that's highlighted and then the
option<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.480> highlighted<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> n<00:00:46.590> /<00:00:47.340> D

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
option that's not highlighted is n / D

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.709 
option that's not highlighted is n / D
so<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.719> n<00:00:48.960> /<00:00:49.469> D<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> highlighted<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so if your n / D is highlighted what you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.819 
so if your n / D is highlighted what you
want<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.770> arrows<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.620> make

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
want to do is use your arrows to make

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
want to do is use your arrows to make
sure<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.579> und<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.539> highlighted<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

mode button because it says quit above
it<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.280> gray<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> option<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.770> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it in gray so that's the option that we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
it in gray so that's the option that we
want<00:01:09.260> now<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.250> want<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> take<00:01:11.900> 39<00:01:13.100> sixths

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
want now if we want to take 39 sixths

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.749 
want now if we want to take 39 sixths
and<00:01:14.330> turn<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.320> mixed<00:01:17.009> number<00:01:17.220> then

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and turn this into a mixed number then

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
and turn this into a mixed number then
all<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.840> type<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.439> exactly

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
all we have to do is type it in exactly

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.080 
all we have to do is type it in exactly
as<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> appears<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> I'll<00:01:20.970> hit<00:01:21.740> 39<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.189> then

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
as it appears so I'll hit 39 and then

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.859 
as it appears so I'll hit 39 and then
the<00:01:24.270> fraction<00:01:24.630> button<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.420> notice<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the fraction button and then notice that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
the fraction button and then notice that
when<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> hit<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> fraction<00:01:28.979> button<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> gave

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
when I hit the fraction button it gave

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
when I hit the fraction button it gave
me<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> fraction<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> automatically<00:01:31.380> made<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
me a fraction it automatically made the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
me a fraction it automatically made the
39<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> entered<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> numerator<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.750> now

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
39 that I entered the numerator so now

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
39 that I entered the numerator so now
all<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.259> need<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.500> 6<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.840> then<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.259> right

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
all we need is 6 and then use your right

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.640 
all we need is 6 and then use your right
arrow<00:01:37.799> button<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:39.140> make<00:01:40.140> sure<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> your

arrow button to make sure that your
cursor<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.130> outside<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> fraction<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
cursor is outside of the fraction and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.819 
cursor is outside of the fraction and
just<00:01:42.750> hit<00:01:42.899> enter<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> it'll<00:01:45.060> tell<00:01:45.329> us<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.829> 39

just hit enter and it'll tell us that 39

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.719 
just hit enter and it'll tell us that 39
6th<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> equivalent<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> 6<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> 1/2<00:01:49.729> now

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
6th is equivalent to 6 and 1/2 now

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.460 
6th is equivalent to 6 and 1/2 now
notice<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.390> our<00:01:51.420> calculator<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
notice with our calculator it

would<00:02:28.210> notice<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.980> man<00:02:30.340> simp<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.970> which

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
would notice is that man simp is which

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.160 
would notice is that man simp is which
means<00:02:32.110> manually<00:02:32.800> simplified<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:34.210> highlighted

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
means manually simplified is highlighted

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.400 
means manually simplified is highlighted
so<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.560> order<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.580> your<00:02:36.850> calculator

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
so in order to have your calculator

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.750 
so in order to have your calculator
automatically<00:02:38.410> simplify<00:02:39.160> what<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.520> want<00:02:39.670> to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
automatically simplify what you want to

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.730 
automatically simplify what you want to
do<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.120> scroll<00:02:40.540> over<00:02:40.780> using<00:02:41.110> your<00:02:41.350> right<00:02:41.530> arrow

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
do is scroll over using your right arrow

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.040 
do is scroll over using your right arrow
to<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.160> auto<00:02:42.400> sim<00:02:42.760> automatically<00:02:43.510> simplify

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
to the auto sim automatically simplify

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.600 
to the auto sim automatically simplify
and<00:02:44.830> hit<00:02:44.980> enter<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.560> lot<00:02:47.860> easier<00:02:48.430> if

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and hit enter it's just a lot easier if

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.610 
and hit enter it's just a lot easier if
your<00:02:48.760> calculator<00:02:49.270> automatically<00:02:49.990> simplifies

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
your calculator automatically simplifies

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.160 
your calculator automatically simplifies
fractions<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.600> let's<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:52.900> ahead<00:02:52.960> and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
fractions for you so let's go ahead and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.770 
fractions for you so let's go ahead and
hit<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> Clear<00:02:53.680> button<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.480> we're<00:02:55.690> gonna

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
hit the Clear button and we're gonna

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.410 
hit the Clear button and we're gonna
take<00:02:56.080> 98<00:02:56.680> sevenths<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.640> we're<00:02:57.940> going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.240> turn

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
take 98 sevenths and we're going to turn

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.680 
take 98 sevenths and we're going to turn
that<00:02:58.480> into<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:59.050> fully<00:02:59.440> reduced<00:02:59.740> mixed<00:03:00.160> number

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that into a fully reduced mixed number

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.350 
that into a fully reduced mixed number
so<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:01.810> hit<00:03:01.960> 98<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.210> hit<00:03:04.300> our

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
so we hit 98 and then we hit our

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.700 
so we hit 98 and then we hit our
fraction<00:03:05.020> button<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:06.720> seven<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.620> we

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
fraction button and then seven so we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.010 
fraction button and then seven so we
have<00:03:08.740> 98<00:03:09.280> sevenths<00:03:09.940> press<00:03:10.360> our<00:03:10.540> right<00:03:10.780> arrow

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
have 98 sevenths press our right arrow

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.320 
have 98 sevenths press our right arrow
and<00:03:11.320> one<00:03:12.040> thing<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.400> want<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.760> emphasize

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
and one thing I just want to emphasize

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.820 
and one thing I just want to emphasize
is<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.570> we<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:14.020> want<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.410> make<00:03:14.530> sure<00:03:14.740> that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
is that we really want to make sure that

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830 
is that we really want to make sure that
we've<00:03:14.980> typed<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.580> exactly<00:03:16.210> what<00:03:16.390> we<00:03:16.510> want<00:03:16.720> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
we've typed in exactly what we want the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.620 
we've typed in exactly what we want the
calculator<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.650> do<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.730> calculator<00:03:19.330> doesn't

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
calculator to do the calculator doesn't

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.410 
calculator to do the calculator doesn't
have<00:03:20.590> any<00:03:20.980> understanding<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.240> we're

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
have any understanding of what we're

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.510 
have any understanding of what we're
trying<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.990> do<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.410> will<00:03:23.590> only<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:24.310> what<00:03:24.490> we

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
trying to do it will only do what we

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.120 
trying to do it will only do what we
tell<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.030> do<00:03:25.270> so<00:03:25.990> I'm<00:03:26.140> always<00:03:26.470> looking<00:03:26.800> back

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
tell it to do so I'm always looking back

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.130 
tell it to do so I'm always looking back
at<00:03:27.370> my<00:03:27.490> screen<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.150> making<00:03:28.540> sure<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.990> I've

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
at my screen and making sure that I've

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.500 
at my screen and making sure that I've
typed<00:03:29.350> things<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.860> correctly<00:03:30.330> once<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.450> know

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
typed things in correctly once I know

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.350 
typed things in correctly once I know
that<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:32.080> correct<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.560> hit<00:03:32.770> enter<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.670> this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
that it's correct I hit enter and this

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.170 
that it's correct I hit enter and this
one<00:03:34.570> tells<00:03:34.720> me<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.050> it's<00:03:35.200> 14<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.910> what<00:03:37.060> that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
one tells me that it's 14 so what that

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.490 
one tells me that it's 14 so what that
tells<00:03:37.510> us<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.460> 98<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:40.750> 7<00:03:41.260> goes<00:03:41.470> into

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
tells us is that 98 and that 7 goes into

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.090 
tells us is that 98 and that 7 goes into
98<00:03:42.220> evenly<00:03:42.880> there's<00:03:43.180> no<00:03:43.360> remainder<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:44.140> so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
98 evenly there's no remainder here so

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.860 
98 evenly there's no remainder here so
rather<00:03:45.400> than<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.760> mixed<00:03:46.090> number<00:03:46.300> we<00:03:46.630> get<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
rather than a mixed number we get a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.440 
rather than a mixed number we get a
whole<00:03:47.170> number<00:03:50.670> now<00:03:51.670> what<00:03:51.880> if<00:03:51.970> we<00:03:52.090> want<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.330> do

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
whole number now what if we want to do

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.850 
whole number now what if we want to do
the<00:03:52.570> opposite<00:03:53.050> what<00:03:53.230> if<00:03:53.320> we<00:03:53.440> want<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.650> take<00:03:53.830> a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
the opposite what if we want to take a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.500 
the opposite what if we want to take a
mixed<00:03:54.220> number<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.730> turn<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.150> into<00:03:55.300> an

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
mixed number and turn it into an

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.370 
mixed number and turn it into an
improper<00:03:55.960> fraction<00:03:56.160> like<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:57.640> example<00:03:58.210> 3<00:03:58.600> we

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
improper fraction like in example 3 we

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.360 
improper fraction like in example 3 we
have<00:03:59.620> 3<00:03:59.860> +<00:04:00.430> 4<00:04:00.760> 13<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.650> what<00:04:02.770> I'm<00:04:02.890> going<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.070> do<00:04:03.220> is

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
have 3 + 4 13 so what I'm going to do is

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.040 
have 3 + 4 13 so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:03.490> going<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:03.670> hit<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.970> 3<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.540> whole<00:04:04.720> number

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
I'm going to hit the 3 the whole number

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm going to hit the 3 the whole number
portion<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.800> then<00:04:06.430> under<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.880> second<00:04:07.330> button

numerator<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.510> want<00:04:19.750> my<00:04:19.780> 4<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.609> into<00:04:21.850> my

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
numerator so I want my 4 to get into my

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.150 
numerator so I want my 4 to get into my
denominator<00:04:22.750> after<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> down<00:04:23.500> button<00:04:24.010> and
