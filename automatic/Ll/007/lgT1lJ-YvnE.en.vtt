00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
all of these machines the big difference

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
all of these machines the big difference
between<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.390> 600<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.020> 500<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
between this one and the 600 and 500 it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240 
between this one and the 600 and 500 it
has<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> color<00:00:47.820> touchscreen<00:00:48.289> whereas<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.739> 600

screens but they all do have touch
screens<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> difference<00:00:56.280> between

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
screens and then the difference between

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
screens and then the difference between
the<00:00:56.699> 700<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> 600<00:00:57.750> beyond<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the 700 and the 600 beyond that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.950 
the 700 and the 600 beyond that
aesthetically<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.719> sort

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
aesthetically is that you get this sort

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
aesthetically is that you get this sort
of<00:01:01.079> silver<00:01:01.440> embellishment<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> 700<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of silver embellishment on the 700 you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.219 
of silver embellishment on the 700 you
don't<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.369> 6<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.210> 500<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
don't have that on the 6 or the 500 so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
don't have that on the 6 or the 500 so
those<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> only<00:01:08.189> big

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
those are really the only big

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120 
those are really the only big
differences<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> come<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
differences when you come right down to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
differences when you come right down to
kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> those<00:01:12.090> initial<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.200> between<00:01:13.500> all

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
kind of those initial things between all

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730 
kind of those initial things between all
of<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> mention<00:01:15.960> when

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
of them the other thing to mention when

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.050 
of them the other thing to mention when
you're<00:01:16.890> talking<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> differences

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you're talking about the differences

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
you're talking about the differences
between<00:01:18.119> each<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
between each of these is going to be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.370 
between each of these is going to be
that<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.180> water<00:01:21.420> reservoirs<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that the water reservoirs are a little

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.399 
that the water reservoirs are a little
bit<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.950> each<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.420> V<00:01:24.600> 500

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
bit different on each one on the V 500

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
bit different on each one on the V 500
you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.920> smallest<00:01:26.250> reservoir<00:01:26.880> that's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
you have the smallest reservoir that's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
you have the smallest reservoir that's
60<00:01:27.450> ounces<00:01:27.570> whereas<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> 6<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
60 ounces whereas over here on the 6 and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
60 ounces whereas over here on the 6 and
the<00:01:29.490> 7<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> 72<00:01:31.200> ounce<00:01:31.500> water

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the 7 you have a 72 ounce water

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.429 
the 7 you have a 72 ounce water
reservoir<00:01:32.700> those<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> major<00:01:33.840> distinct

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
reservoir those are the major distinct

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
reservoir those are the major distinct
differences<00:01:34.860> between<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.520> machines<00:01:35.759> let's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
differences between these machines let's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.640 
differences between these machines let's
talk<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.630> another<00:01:37.020> difference<00:01:37.530> between

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
talk about another difference between

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
talk about another difference between
these<00:01:38.250> machines<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
these machines that you're not going to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
these machines that you're not going to
be<00:01:39.750> able<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.290> camera<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.009> just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to tell you about it now this V
700<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.820> V<00:01:44.970> 600<00:01:45.720> both<00:01:46.020> clock<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:47.509> 1500

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
700 and V 600 both clock in at 1500

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.130 
700 and V 600 both clock in at 1500
watts<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.680> their<00:01:49.829> operating<00:01:50.430> wattage

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
watts for their operating wattage

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
watts for their operating wattage
whereas<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> V<00:01:53.009> 500<00:01:53.759> you're<00:01:53.909> looking<00:01:54.240> at

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
whereas on the V 500 you're looking at

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.709 
whereas on the V 500 you're looking at
14<00:01:55.079> 70<00:01:55.979> watts<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:57.180> bit<00:01:57.329> less<00:01:57.540> energy

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
14 70 watts so a little bit less energy

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.100 
14 70 watts so a little bit less energy
consumption<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> V<00:01:59.579> 500<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.960> other

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
consumption on the V 500 the other

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.450 
consumption on the V 500 the other
difference<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.680> again<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.159> something

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
difference and again this is something

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
difference and again this is something
that<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.700> can't<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.689> camera<00:02:03.990> but

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that you can't really see on camera but

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.050 
that you can't really see on camera but
I<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.469> tell<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> big<00:02:05.009> difference<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.909> V

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I can tell you is a big difference the V

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.109 
I can tell you is a big difference the V
500<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> much<00:02:07.170> lighter<00:02:07.649> than<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.340> 600<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
500 is much lighter than the 600 and the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.570 
500 is much lighter than the 600 and the
700<00:02:09.690> these<00:02:09.840> machines<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.500> pretty<00:02:10.770> darn<00:02:11.129> heavy

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
700 these machines are pretty darn heavy

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
700 these machines are pretty darn heavy
they<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.690> lot<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.590> may

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
they do have a lot going on so that may

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
they do have a lot going on so that may
a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> sense<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> V<00:02:15.510> 500<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.290> much

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
a lot of sense but the V 500 is much

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
a lot of sense but the V 500 is much
much<00:02:16.830> lighter<00:02:17.040> even<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.550> water<00:02:17.910> added<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
much lighter even with water added to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540 
much lighter even with water added to
its<00:02:18.930> water<00:02:19.530> reservoir<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> find<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.430> it's

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
its water reservoir I find that it's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.430 
its water reservoir I find that it's
much<00:02:20.760> lighter<00:02:21.060> than<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> two<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.260> these

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
much lighter than the two of these

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.170 
much lighter than the two of these
machines<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.220> those<00:02:23.400> are<00:02:23.550> some<00:02:23.700> distinct

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
machines so those are some distinct

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.490 
machines so those are some distinct
differences<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.110> energy

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
differences a little bit of energy

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.220 
differences a little bit of energy
savings<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.570> maybe<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.110> bit

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
savings and you know maybe a little bit

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.750 
savings and you know maybe a little bit
of<00:02:28.290> savings<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.800> your<00:02:28.890> muscles<00:02:29.250> depending<00:02:29.670> on

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
of savings to your muscles depending on

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.830 
of savings to your muscles depending on
how<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.030> you're<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.390> moving<00:02:30.600> each

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
how much you're going to be moving each

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.460 
how much you're going to be moving each
of<00:02:30.960> these<00:02:31.110> around<00:02:31.790> finally<00:02:32.790> let's<00:02:33.090> talk<00:02:33.330> about

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
of these around finally let's talk about

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
of these around finally let's talk about
the<00:02:34.470> button<00:02:34.980> designs<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.670> each<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:36.000> these<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the button designs on each of these and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.210 
the button designs on each of these and
I<00:02:36.420> are<00:02:36.570> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> notice<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.650> 700

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
I are going to notice that on the 700

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.980 
I are going to notice that on the 700
and<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> 600<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> brew<00:02:39.270> button<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.780> right

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and the 600 the brew button is right

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.280 
and the 600 the brew button is right
here<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.470> top<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> brew<00:02:41.550> basket<00:02:42.140> for<00:02:43.140> some

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
here on top of the brew basket for some

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
here on top of the brew basket for some
reason<00:02:43.530> always<00:02:43.680> found<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.370> bit

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
reason always found that a little bit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.820 
reason always found that a little bit
strange<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.240> don't<00:02:45.480> know<00:02:45.600> why<00:02:45.810> maybe<00:02:46.620> it's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
strange I don't know why maybe it's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.800 
strange I don't know why maybe it's
because<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.310> used<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.940> using<00:02:48.360> multiple

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
because I'm just used to using multiple

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
because I'm just used to using multiple
buttons<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.380> brew<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:49.950> very<00:02:50.130> different

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
buttons to brew and it's very different

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.860 
buttons to brew and it's very different
with<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> Vue<00:02:50.910> machines<00:02:51.270> where<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.720> use

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
with the Vue machines where you just use

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.050 
with the Vue machines where you just use
one<00:02:52.110> button<00:02:52.410> after<00:02:52.739> you've<00:02:53.340> selected<00:02:53.520> what

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
one button after you've selected what

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.040 
one button after you've selected what
you<00:02:54.180> want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> brew<00:02:54.570> on<00:02:54.720> your<00:02:54.840> touchscreen

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
you want to brew on your touchscreen

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.720 
you want to brew on your touchscreen
well<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.130> little<00:02:56.340> different<00:02:56.610> so

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
well that's a little different so

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.120 
well that's a little different so
different<00:02:57.060> over<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.080> V<00:02:58.230> 500<00:02:58.920> where

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
different over here on the V 500 where

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.460 
different over here on the V 500 where
your<00:02:59.280> brew<00:02:59.459> button<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.840> right<00:03:01.080> front

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
your brew button is on the right front

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.570 
your brew button is on the right front
hand<00:03:01.739> side<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.790> machine<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.350> a

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
hand side of the machine so that is a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.650 
hand side of the machine so that is a
slightly<00:03:05.580> distinct<00:03:06.120> difference<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
slightly distinct difference it's a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660 
slightly distinct difference it's a
little<00:03:06.870> smaller<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:07.500> either<00:03:08.220> way<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
little smaller but either way the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.490 
little smaller but either way the
operation<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.900> same<00:03:10.170> which

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
operation is going to be the same which

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.930 
operation is going to be the same which
is<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:10.980> dropping<00:03:11.220> your<00:03:11.430> view<00:03:11.700> pack

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
is going to be dropping your view pack

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.360 
is going to be dropping your view pack

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the 600 and the 500 are kind of almost

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.259 
the 600 and the 500 are kind of almost
the<00:04:13.890> same<00:04:14.070> machine<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> exception<00:04:15.209> of

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
the same machine with the exception of

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.670 
the same machine with the exception of
some<00:04:15.450> small<00:04:15.870> differences<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.560> I've

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
some small differences that I've

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.920 
some small differences that I've
outlined<00:04:17.100> but<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> pricing<00:04:18.479> difference<00:04:18.780> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
outlined but the pricing difference is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.310 
outlined but the pricing difference is
very<00:04:19.260> very<00:04:20.100> distinct<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:21.570> V<00:04:21.720> 500

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
very very distinct with that V 500

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.010 
very very distinct with that V 500
coming<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.830> at<00:04:23.070> least<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.550> good<00:04:23.910> chunk<00:04:24.360> cheaper

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
coming in at least a good chunk cheaper

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.410 
coming in at least a good chunk cheaper

a little bit thrifty and get into a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.490 
a little bit thrifty and get into a
Keurig<00:04:29.310> Vue<00:04:29.430> machine<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.060> V<00:04:30.180> 500<00:04:30.930> is<00:04:31.080> gonna<00:04:31.380> be

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
Keurig Vue machine the V 500 is gonna be

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.350 
Keurig Vue machine the V 500 is gonna be
the<00:04:31.620> way<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.770> go<00:04:32.040> but<00:04:32.520> however<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.120> price

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
the way to go but however the price

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.210 
the way to go but however the price
difference<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:33.900> not<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.470> much<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.920> decide

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220

difference is not so much if you decide
to<00:04:35.340> go<00:04:35.460> up<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.760> V<00:04:35.880> 700<00:04:36.750> if<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.440> just<00:04:37.620> want

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
to go up to the V 700 if you just want

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.200 
to go up to the V 700 if you just want
to<00:04:37.860> get<00:04:37.980> all<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.400> features<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.910> one<00:04:39.030> fell

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
to get all the features in one fell

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.730 
to get all the features in one fell
swoop<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.630> get<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.200> color<00:04:40.440> touchscreen

swoop and get that color touchscreen

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.860 
swoop and get that color touchscreen
which<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.460> admittedly<00:04:41.760> kind<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.480> cool

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
which is admittedly kind of cool

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.510 
which is admittedly kind of cool
what's<00:04:43.350> my<00:04:43.440> bottom<00:04:43.770> line<00:04:43.920> on<00:04:44.160> all<00:04:44.280> these

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
what's my bottom line on all these

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.100 
what's my bottom line on all these
machines<00:04:44.910> well<00:04:45.150> my<00:04:45.330> bottom<00:04:45.600> line<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.960> that

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
machines well my bottom line is that

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.110 
machines well my bottom line is that
I've<00:04:46.230> used<00:04:46.500> each<00:04:46.740> one<00:04:47.010> I've<00:04:47.280> used<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.760> lot<00:04:47.910> i

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
I've used each one I've used it a lot i

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.640 
I've used each one I've used it a lot i
brewed<00:04:48.510> coffee<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.230> different<00:04:49.500> beverages

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
brewed coffee and different beverages

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.590 
brewed coffee and different beverages
with<00:04:50.040> each<00:04:50.160> one<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.700> think<00:04:50.910> any<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.360> them

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
with each one and I think any of them

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600 
with each one and I think any of them
are<00:04:51.780> gonna<00:04:51.870> make<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.110> great<00:04:52.230> addition<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.100> your

are gonna make a great addition to your
at-home<00:04:54.270> coffee<00:04:54.510> shop<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:55.140> think<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> only

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
at-home coffee shop I think the only

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.290 
at-home coffee shop I think the only
thing<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.100> really<00:04:56.370> need<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.640> choose<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:56.940> how

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
thing you really need to choose is how

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.270

exactly the features are that you're

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.180 
exactly the features are that you're
looking<00:05:01.260> for<00:05:01.530> because<00:05:01.800> you're<00:05:01.920> not<00:05:02.010> really

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
looking for because you're not really

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.310 
looking for because you're not really
gonna<00:05:02.430> lose<00:05:02.850> or<00:05:03.150> gain<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.390> whole<00:05:03.750> lot<00:05:04.020> with<00:05:04.260> each

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
gonna lose or gain a whole lot with each

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.800 
gonna lose or gain a whole lot with each
one<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.640> kind<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.060> comes<00:05:06.300> down<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.660> how

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
one so it just kind of comes down to how

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.600 
one so it just kind of comes down to how
maybe<00:05:07.140> picky<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.770> are<00:05:07.800> when<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.190> comes<00:05:08.310> to

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
maybe picky you are when it comes to

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.430 
maybe picky you are when it comes to
your<00:05:08.730> machine<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.750> exception<00:05:10.170> on<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.320> vie

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
your machine the exception on the vie

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.290 
your machine the exception on the vie
500<00:05:10.980> being<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.280> little<00:05:11.460> bit<00:05:11.550> lighter<00:05:11.850> there's

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
500 being a little bit lighter there's

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.420 
500 being a little bit lighter there's
not<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> whole<00:05:12.870> major<00:05:13.410> difference<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.310> on

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
not a whole major difference going on

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.010 
not a whole major difference going on
between<00:05:14.580> all<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:14.970> these<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:15.540> it's<00:05:15.660> just<00:05:15.840> down

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
between all of these so it's just down

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.780 
between all of these so it's just down
to<00:05:16.200> how<00:05:16.290> much<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.560> want<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> spend<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:17.280> know<00:05:17.670> if
