 in session david pascual 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.150
 there are very few juices that give a 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.370
 first impression very good in your 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.369

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.070
 50 hours of game the witcher tree 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.690
 Williams is one of them with two 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.250
 previous deliveries that have been elevating 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.900
 your narrative quality to your invoice 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.990

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.200
 playability the youngsters of ps4 xbox one 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.810
 or ipc are in luck when receiving 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.390
 this excellent new job of feed and 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.129
 little project could imagine andrzej 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.429
 sapkowski that his series of seven books 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.780
 who wrote about if it was from rivia 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.149
 would inspire such good eyes 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.640
 for many it is possible that this is the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.120
 first time they meet the white wolf or 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.249
 be yesterday but do not fear because the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.379
 story that arises in this game not 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.350
 you need the previous two to 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.329
 understood at a certain moment we can give 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.370
 one or the other answers as if 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.190
 we would have played the witcher to 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.409
 assassins of kings to give simple 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.799
 continuity and coherence and outline 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.060
 certain aspects of our character 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.250
 quickly enter the story that of 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.180
 trapped ipsofacto it is something 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 who decides 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.720
 dominates even more in william a kinematics 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.030
 overwhelming an intro that puts us in 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.890
 the world in which we will play and everything already 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.020
 we are controlling asier without giving us 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.180
 account in a game that already good to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.130
 The first gives us a multitude of options 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.070
 main missions characters and 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.740
 secondary in a very environment but that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 very wide the game mechanics the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.610
 possibilities of creation of disposition 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.190
 of personalization skills 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.890
 character the object diagrams the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.750
 alchemy the mutagens control dominate 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.149
 and take advantage of everything that this 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.820
 delivery inherits what it modifies or 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.399
 adds could have caused a chaos of 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.649
 information to come together so suddenly 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.020
 but not again everything is fine 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.840
 explained in small tutorials that go 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 properly appearing those who 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.170
 know this character for the first time 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 They must know that we are facing a 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.610
 rpg with high doses of action in a 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 open world full of missions 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 commissions favors crowd of enemies 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.080
 that bend and much exploration great 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.990
 games like this one are making the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.450
 rpg are gaining exponentially 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.250
 more and more followers 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 since we made contact with the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 first personages we believe in wild hand 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.390
 we are aware that what we do 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.390
 we say and how we say it because it has 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.310
 a much more important weight now according to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.379
 the answer we give may appear 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 a script line with new sentences or 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.819
 do not induce we have the answers of others 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.069
 or there will also be answers in which 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.980
 make a decision or another before 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.170
 time among other options too 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.620
 we can bargain and do good or bad 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.470
 some decisions modify the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.959
 the course of history influence the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.360
 behavior of others a posteriori 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.819
 and can take them to some facts or other 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 what you see on the screen at this moment 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.980
 is a clear example with two options 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.450
 totally different as we select 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.799
 All the information we collect from 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.290
 the conversations with the characters 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.180
 main and secondary with people 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.709
 of the taverns what is explained to us in 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.560
 the side missions and we read in 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.329
 posters letters etcetera is enlarging 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.940
 the rich history of the witcher trick 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.760
 everything has a reason and is in the game 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.870
 for something there is absolutely nothing of 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 filling 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.129
 and the secondary missions accumulate 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.209
 experience is seen using the points of 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.670
 ability to enhance aspects 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.620
 liabilities and assets of the character buy 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.080
 best weapons armor and clothing and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.629
 repair them and make the most of 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.849
 capacity of our inventory how many 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.280
 more missions and favors let's do more and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.140
 better equipped we can be and for 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.900
 therefore more experience we can 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.060
 accumulate in less time not always 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.610
 we will be fighting or talking sometimes 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.010
 we'll even have to find which detective 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.470
 and that is where we will use our vision 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.739
 of sorcerer to look for clues in plan 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.109
 batman arkham evidently the action 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.090
 plays a fundamental role strong attack 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.180
 and fast attack block skiing roll 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.650
 magic and throwing weapons all these 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.359
 are the usual actions that we will do 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.389
 in the game distributed in a way 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.010
 successful and quite intuitive to the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.620
 crosshead is assigned quick options 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.270
 sheathed and unsheathed from each of 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.760
 the two main weapons to right and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.490
 left as well as use of potions and 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.229
 food up and down is possible 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 mark a target to attack him 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.650
 while we move around you 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.300
 the gameplay is something more dynamic than 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.710
 the view in his previous delivery with a 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.410
 something more agile 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.140
 gerald can finish or execute the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.970
 We see ourselves enemies with a lot of ease 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.950
 and at the time of battle we have a 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.800
 wide range of possibilities thanks 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.140
 to our magic and weapons sometimes 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.270
 especially when we are surrounded the 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.180
 character does not attack well is objective 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.100
 thus giving some blows in the air to 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.050
 times the cameras are blocked in certain 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.510
 places preventing seeing correctly 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.340
 who is hitting us small 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.710
 imperfections that are good as well as 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.620
 a pimple that does not make the product 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.330
 but the play space looks so 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
 vast that the use of our horse is 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.890
 It's essential, luckily, too 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.300
 we have quick trips that we will go 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.570
 unlocking as we go 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.610
 discovering the map the whole environment 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.800
 is completely alive and moves according to 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.750
 our acts characters who make their 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.790
 tasks until we bother enemies 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.980
 that we are being scolded by creatures that 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.350
 attack characters with animal memory 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.870
 that they roam at ease and avoid us if 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.730
 we try to hunt the collection of 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.480
 materials for alchemy as well as 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.130
 harvest 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.800

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.080
 improve or sell then welcome be to 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.210

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.860
 it blows more according to the time of day the 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.260
 lighting of the playing field according to 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.110
 the different time uses that we can 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.490
 vary and sleep when we want and the 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.400
 influence of that day night in the 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.380

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.880
 of the environment so excellent that it deserves to be 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.650
 treated as a protagonist of the

 For the first time a patch is downloaded

 that improves the performance of it 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.680
 note certain downgrade in console 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.780
 compared to the time seen in the past
