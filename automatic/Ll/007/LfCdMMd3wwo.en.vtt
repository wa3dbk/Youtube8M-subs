00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.420
 Let's start now another chat about fashion 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 and today again the engine interpretation 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.919
 the return of the silk shirt 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.119
 is now said that teaching without a suit 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 f 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.779
 it's a theme the reality is a person who has returned 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 returned to be a female wardrobe piece 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.579
 the shirt 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.199
 like ways to the table where they were a little 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.070
 that shirt said yeda 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 delicious, focused on my 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 sometimes even the truck 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 he was out wins from the female wardrobe 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.590
 what we have seen so far are the shirts on the head but with the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 is more attuned 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.550
 it's still jammed 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.370
 but with the shirt designed with a differentiated structure 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.780
 closest to male modeling 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.380
 she 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.150
 return 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.520
 and I made this modern because 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.710
 he despite being a clean basic piece 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.010
 a clinical modeling 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.990
 he managed 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.980
 innovate 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.440
 rc you send to our previous child 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.920
 the ideal for us we did a study of a world blue with japan 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.150
 or slaughter 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.480
 but who gives the signatures in front 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.650
 Did you see how to play the game? 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620
 and there he wears a shirt 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.550
 the same technique you will perform to make a tea people was a such here 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 as from this method is simple 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 the other has this aquidauana cut 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240
 80 is passing here on the course 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.330
 and in that part 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 was cut in that round shape 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.770
 now it's good it can be 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.349
 cut in the shape of a snail as we created it in the nano 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.829
 in our part of yesterday afternoon 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.090
 or you just take that measurement 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.029
 on the neckline until the match 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.049
 and transform it here into the circuit 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 there are several ways to do this and you can get 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 to do this is this straight statistic 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.999
 and then if you do stay in it at this time 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.560
 infor 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.329
 curving this modeling you will promote 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.379
 it be done here 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.939
 so you want a really cool tip 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 a simple person 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.419
 now that the lad houses 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.249
 this house here is a right letter in the place 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.889
 What interests us is that it is signed by it. 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.899
 but I left more women 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.650
 by her screen 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.230
 and more easily bypassing little 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.029
 because 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.190
 home 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.800
 is the land producing 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.459
 but this piece 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.909
 she still does not have that catastrophe 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.909
 she is a person and hit in place 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 here in the passages you may have to have a word 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.569
 and when trying to forward army 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.459
 it is in him that I said that the masculine style 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.929
 what happens that uses what she has the goal for 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.679
 of the same principle 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.039
 this detail transposed this year if you pay more 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.809
 are two pre-classified on the same side 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.809
 producing this effect 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:53.339
 here on the commander is probably the one that seems to me to have some harry student cutouts 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.440
 something 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 differentiated but can not give to the people he has 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.280
 and with the rest it is that way 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.569
 if you're already past 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.549
 defendant 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.639
 I think that even here in the channel of the event in the shrimp I already put the 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.389
 shirt making 1 sure 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.380
 but try to do in installments 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.650
 of 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.439
 for all and very well explained 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.439
 to remove the white collar that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.189
 that 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.449
 you can see the seams here right? 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.990
 why him 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.580
 natural finish here in this part 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.849
 is delayed 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.849
 it's not double that little boat 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.159
 very delicate 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.509
 a characteristic of the collar 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.639
 for this season is that the collars are eating the beaks 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.490
 so if you received 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.879
 the area she modeling 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.340
 is a home to the nine cities of the collar 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.560
 to keep up with fashion trends you're going to have to take a picture 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.460
 the beak would have to sign a little bit 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.509
 It's going to be possible and I'm going to pause here. 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.099
 had to stop 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.719
 that damn 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.330
 what's happening now 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.919
 not what you can not do to make payments like you received 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.909
 but it's always good to be here, there's nothing 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.300
 and at least some species 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.560
 always innovating they give pain that they 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.729
 but those who are late in the state 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.020
 5ยบ will make your product to your parts that have 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.529
 there is something more something different 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.230
 it is 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.059
 We're going to stay here. 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.780
 if you wish 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.880
 really produce parts with the quali-mt itself of the stock with quality 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.449
 harry reid accepted alcohol free of high cost 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.169
 of all the knowledge necessary for the production of both the first and 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.749
 series 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.150
 As for our courses we have eight motorcycle courses 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.080

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.189
