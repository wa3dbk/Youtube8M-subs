to<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.890> them<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.990> either<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
to take them out is either with the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.960 
to take them out is either with the
sticky<00:01:07.770> grenade<00:01:08.190> or<00:01:09.440> brute<00:01:10.440> shot<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.970> guess

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
sticky grenade or brute shot I guess

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
sticky grenade or brute shot I guess
using<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.660> battle<00:01:12.930> rifle<00:01:13.200> ammo<00:01:13.410> on<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
using all my battle rifle ammo on that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.080 
using all my battle rifle ammo on that
one<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> best<00:01:14.820> way<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
one was the best way they can now as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.590 
one was the best way they can now as
soon<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> first<00:01:18.780> archway<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
soon as you get to the first archway a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.730 
soon as you get to the first archway a
good<00:01:21.600> amount<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> floods<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.410> to<00:01:22.470> start

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
good amount of floods going to start

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.530 
good amount of floods going to start
either<00:01:23.130> jumping<00:01:23.610> behind<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> spawning

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
either jumping behind you to spawning

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
either jumping behind you to spawning
behind<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.350> exactly<00:01:25.680> sure<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:26.100> they

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
behind you I'm not exactly sure how they

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
behind you I'm not exactly sure how they
get<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.869> but<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> entire<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.410> up<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
get there but the entire way up this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
get there but the entire way up this
tower<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.090> slow<00:01:30.360> very

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
tower you just take you really slow very

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
tower you just take you really slow very
methodical<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:34.520> make<00:01:35.520> sure<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:35.820> kill<00:01:36.030> every

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
methodical and make sure you kill every

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
methodical and make sure you kill every
single<00:01:36.390> enemy<00:01:37.259> before<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.550> rush

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
single enemy before you like rush

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.969 
single enemy before you like rush
forward<00:01:39.830> because<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.100> many<00:01:41.220> people<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
forward because so many people just

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
forward because so many people just
blank<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.460> spawn<00:01:44.820> behind<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.450> not

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
blank you and spawn behind you it's not

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.460 
blank you and spawn behind you it's not
really<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:48.289> good<00:01:49.289> place<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.710> rush<00:01:49.920> through

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
really a a good place to rush through

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.320 
really a a good place to rush through
now<00:01:52.470> you'll<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:52.830> notice<00:01:53.069> red<00:01:53.910> dots<00:01:54.149> on

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
now you'll probably notice red dots on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.590 
now you'll probably notice red dots on
my<00:01:54.360> radar<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.880> ignoring<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
my radar that I'm just ignoring at this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
my radar that I'm just ignoring at this
point<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.259> there's<00:01:59.069> a<00:01:59.160> lot

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
point and that's because there's a lot

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
point and that's because there's a lot
of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.819> crawler<00:02:00.420> flood<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> side

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of the crawler flood going up the side

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.930 
of the crawler flood going up the side
just<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.810> tower<00:02:04.160> like<00:02:05.160> Johnson<00:02:05.580> just<00:02:05.729> said

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
just the tower like Johnson just said

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.180 
just the tower like Johnson just said
himself<00:02:08.390> crawling<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.780> tower<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
himself crawling all over the tower and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.620 
himself crawling all over the tower and
they<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.400> come<00:02:11.700> after<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.540> know

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
they don't come after you I don't know

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.809 
they don't come after you I don't know
where<00:02:12.810> they're<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:14.010> they're

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
where they're really going but they're

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:22.110 
where they're really going but they're
not<00:02:14.970> coming<00:02:15.270> after<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.260> ignore<00:02:16.410> me

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.750 

I<00:02:22.440> bet<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.620> wanted<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> set<00:02:24.159> some<00:02:24.400> sort<00:02:24.700> of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
I bet if you wanted to set some sort of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.180 
I bet if you wanted to set some sort of
a<00:02:24.940> world<00:02:25.840> record<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.420> metascore<00:02:28.870> game

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
a world record for the metascore game

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.380 
a world record for the metascore game
you<00:02:30.190> could<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:31.230> wait<00:02:32.230> by<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.739> middle

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you could just wait by that middle

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.640 
you could just wait by that middle
support<00:02:34.390> beam<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.530> guess<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:35.980> call<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
support beam I guess you can call it and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.319 
support beam I guess you can call it and
just<00:02:38.650> kill<00:02:38.920> every<00:02:39.190> single<00:02:39.220> one<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.610> them<00:02:39.790> every

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
just kill every single one of them every

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.580 
just kill every single one of them every
single<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.780> crawlers<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.260> goes<00:02:41.409> by

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
single one of the crawlers that goes by

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.740 
single one of the crawlers that goes by
because<00:02:42.299> they<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.450> continually<00:02:45.629> run<00:02:46.629> up

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
because they just continually run up

00:02:46.750 --> 00:04:06.510 
because they just continually run up
there

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:05:07.790 

Oh

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.690 

bark<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.370> there<00:05:09.610> open<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.690> damn<00:05:10.840> door
