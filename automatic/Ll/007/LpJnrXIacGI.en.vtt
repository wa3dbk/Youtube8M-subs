00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.280
 in los los color a work of mine in the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.280
 symphony no 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.180
 which is world premiere 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.180
 classical music 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.100
 historical that detail does not say she of 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.440
 chronic they worked theoretical and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.440
 He did as he says sanitary service 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 but 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:49.710
 something like that and it is also what chronicle has 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.710
 has one thing that really 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 I do not know but 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.950
 wolf is not 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.949
 but 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.320
 I believe that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.690
 although stockings sucks 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:19.190
 when summer approaches 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:23.550
 in fact for this novel he did not engineer them 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.700
 for the supplement that I with this paper 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.720
 that has everything very nice but after 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.720
 You saw me I am a degenerate 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.229
 as he has no idea 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.190
 but they still put all and not only 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.100
 mine but from everyone who gave his 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.009
 provision I read chronic and I liked 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.290
 It must be 44 I did not feel like throwing up 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.830
 I bought chronicles and I would think if 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.870
 We could visit from Algeria but this one 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.760
 when 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.760
 what shall we say 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 the one that has to see what the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.850
 environment what for what chronicle has a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.000
 persuasion bigger than others 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.959
 newspapers for why to make him say 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.959
 to people for example 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.810
 for dad and that is me I think that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.970
 how am i this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.150
 the owner of the boys and girls of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.150
 this country 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.069
 in the absence of the maximum idol the other the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.069
 9 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.020
 they would have to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.349
 being a little more than 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.560
 basis in the sense that the kid is 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.330
 can you tire of still the balls 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.580
 being the most famous person of this 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.970
 country being the best musician and I feel that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.849
 good chronic this being that what they have 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.370
 what do you have to use two or 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.530
 three pages from your journal to 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.490
 teaching music can only help and everything 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.250
 and it's that and hector Ricardo GarcÃ­a although 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.920
 be by the last name please minimum 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.760
 dear because I have seen that it is not going to 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.760
 count one day 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.129
 they were wrong
