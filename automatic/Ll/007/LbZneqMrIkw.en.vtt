00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello today we are going to prepare framework 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.629
 you will need 3 green bananas 4 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.139
 tablespoons butter or oil 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.930
 olive half a cup of cold water and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.510
 salt for onion sauteed an onion 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.970
 large red sliced 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.869
 butter or olive oil a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.760
 splash of vinegar and salt to taste this 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.760
 It is a dish of the Dominican Republic 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.830
 here I have water that I have boiled 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.370
 in a deep pot and here I have my three 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.039
 green bananas 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.520
 what we are going to do is cut the two 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.000
 ends that is the two ends of this 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 way 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.239
 and now we're going to split it in half 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 as you are seeing and now we are going to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.430
 make a vertical cut that is not so 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.559
 deep that is like the one you're 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 watching now in the video and then what 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.480
 let's introduce in our pot with 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.369
 the water that is already boiling like 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.040
 way we do with the second banana 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.920
 the vertical cuts we introduce them 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.909
 in the pot with water and here is the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 third banana 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.249
 we let it boil for a while and when they see that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.520
 already begins to change color they are going to 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:25.299
 add salt like about two teaspoons 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.299
 more or less 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.340
 already when you see that the shell has 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.119
 open in this way they are ready 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.329
 to remove them we put out the fire we leave 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.500
 rest a while we will eliminate 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.080
 all the water 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.590
 and with a pair of tweezers very carefully 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 to remove the husks as you see is very 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.130
 easy to remove the shells but 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 be careful because this is very 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 hot 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 once you already have the bananas well 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.500
 peeled that you have peel 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.620
 you're going to split them in half and you're 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.960
 seeds if you want to remove them is for 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.930
 that do not come out with lumps but in my case 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.190
 I left them on I never took them off I read 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.190
 also that this is optional 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.340
 with a potato provider or with a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.200
 you will help yourself and you will crush 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.980
 everything here today has changed a fork 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 simple small and I started crushing everything 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.100
 the banana once you have it 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 You are about to add olive oil 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.270
 If you do not have olive oil, you can 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.810
 put a little butter 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.810
 melted 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.930
 and you're going to start moving then you're going to 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.720
 go adding the cold water of both things 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.840
 the cold water will serve the banana 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.860
 so that it is linked he cited and everything is like this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.440
 like as a dough like a dough like 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.410
 see consistency and in return I will come 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.330
 adding little by little water until 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.300
 achieve consistency as you are seeing 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.060
 of puree purÃ©e well as a species 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.290
 already when it is so we have it ready 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.690
 and we are perfect to start doing 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.970
 the jumping of the onion here I already have 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.370
 my onions cut into slices 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.770
 if you can cut them a little thinner 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.110
 better here I'm melting 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.120
 butter in a pan 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.230
 and what I'm going to do is add the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.610
 Onion slices open in my pan 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.610
 together with the butter 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.700
 so you're watching and we're going to start 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.739
 to move 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.980
 until they are browned and put on 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.980
 crystal clear here I have regular salt 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.670
 and a stream of vinegar will be diluted 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.130
 good good good 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.240
 and we're going to add it to our onions 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.550
 and we will continue moving 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.510
 just a little bit more because they are already 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.860
 perfect to add on the handle 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.860
 jose to our banana puree 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.130
 we put out the pan the fire forgiveness and 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.090
 let's place our onions 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.639
 sauteed on our mango 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.790
 we are going to remove everything we are going to move everything 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.000
 everything as you see that fat girl is already 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.050
 incorporating with our banana puree 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.050
 and it will stay like this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.100
 you prove if you are missing a 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.830
 touch of salt will increase this is to taste 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.230
 from you 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.920
 and ready we decorate with a sprig of 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.180
 culantro because it has been more colorful and 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.180
 is ready to serve 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.839
 It was delicious I hope you liked it
