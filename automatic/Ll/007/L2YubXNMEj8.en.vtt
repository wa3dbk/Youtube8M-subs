00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 quite different from already on Friday there was a surprising 6 to 4 -success 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.100
 in Halle and then followed yesterday guest and makes the boss before in the derby against 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.619
 slip 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.759
 The games from 2 to 2 years are invested here 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.800
 by Kai Barth 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.749
 he died Katherine Legge lay 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.449
 the investors and the more negotiates for all about 400 left on the corpses 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 the children fishing village 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.800
 Within three minutes the Denkendorfer completes the Passau Black Hawks 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.499
 26 minutes of play 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.900
 the disc jumps Thomas Greilinger on the racket 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.050
 2 to 1 under cheers towards Passau France 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 Of these, Gallinger was often insulted below the waist 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.090
 exactly 25 seconds later, the next goal he does not stimulate the ESC on the Web 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 attacked 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.540
 the punishment followed on foot 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.100
 3 to 1 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.819
 Instead of resting on this tab, celebration was inaugurated 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.850
 Thomas Kunze sees the better positioned John Sicinski 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.040
 4 2 1 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.970
 the mood was barely bearable, especially since they are the short ones 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.620
 once again a last one 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.329
 but this time it was not the Gegenfurtner goal 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.079
 but Sebastian knows four goals in three minutes the game was decided 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.420
 the opponents should red-bull renault costs who while LG Passau 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 Approval repeat once again went well 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.729
 if, however, Schinköthe continues to perform as well as it does at Schinköthe 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:26.260
 Eve 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.630
 You do not have to be afraid of your opponents 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.280
 a little surprising then this is the black box were the lead 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.490
 Christian himself could serve Vladimir Bomhoff one to zero after 17 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 minutes 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.780
 that seemed like that was the initial spark for Deggendorf Fire 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.050
 been in quasi in return Schinköthe pulls off 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.280
 one to one everything open again 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the second third then the 4 goals package here again the slow motion Greilinger 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.510
 is right 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
 weird in that the invitation 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 they are thanking Culture for the pass 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 and happy that the bosses but not bring the disc way 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.599
 even the five-to-one text of the text was far from Sebastian's 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.599
 knows but can parry this time 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.760
 only this scene is not tasted the party responsible 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:22.559
 to have 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:27.159
 comical with the bad pass in the couple look the fast suits Janne Kujala with the 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.539
 two to five 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.889
 Towns hope again 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.299
 but even before the third break the home team showed who this is 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.239
 Tom has called Coughlin has no problems the rebound in a goal 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.279
 convert coins 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.689
 with 6 to 2 it went into the second third break 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.309
 and latin the cheeky goal shooting might have gone on 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:50.400
 Impartial but meanwhile get pity for the blackouts and gave that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.729
 Do not score 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.159
 a party that seemed particularly pissed off 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.159
 Daniel is under the sheath with the distance shot 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.739
 And this time also the referees had no complaints 7 to 2 so for the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.379
 BSC 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.740
 but even now he was still no peace 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.810
 Michelle something excited to measure 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.759
 8 to 2 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.349
 Now Fall returned the favor so much for the final defeat 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.729
 and maybe also for the treatment in Passau 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.209
 just think of the locker room in which the players had to force 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.510
 19 2 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.510
 the second goal of Kei Lingen this evening 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.259
 Well, and that is ninth two does not sound as nice as 10 had to two 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.309
 of course, a hit and him worried Michael Endraß 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.299
 Unfortunate action by white Hocks worked one could already a little bit 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.299
 to hurt 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.399
 to have been a consolation to Marcus that no one is comfortable with the opposite 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.289
 Thoughts were already at the party and the Black Ops hit the 3 for the goal 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.019
 could 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.849
 In return, Case would like to re-establish the 8-lead advantage 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:05.359
 can 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.589
 But Philipp Weinzierl fails 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.739
 no matter what a tenth 3 is a great result pure advertising for the 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.759
 Ice hockey in Denkendorf 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.039
 I hope that we will play again today 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.930
 both spouses have shown life so when he smoked in the spouse 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.400
 will or more people come from the completely incomprehensible 

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:26.939
 Percent Wimmer conceded that he got on Twitter I in the 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.580
 remaining four goals conceded 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.770
 while lending the user song this is not a professional attitude of the players 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.949
 Arno Bunzel scoured at 9 o'clock then we will see where lies 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.479
 Sonnyboy Sócrate's Posco Marcus Tober 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.960
 Applicants are far so willing the lawyer murder will run better again 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.620
 as surely as the role of Europeans questioning people 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.130
 The presence illustrates the state of mind of the two participants 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.050
 societies 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.919
 Water and soil 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.509
 and Deggendorf on top 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.509
 It can go on like this 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:06.469
 to be biased
