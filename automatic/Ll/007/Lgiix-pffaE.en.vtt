00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.620 
yeah you have to let you have to just go
right<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.280> can't<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:51.030> can't<00:03:51.270> just<00:03:51.360> keep

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
right and you can't you can't just keep

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.930 
right and you can't you can't just keep
going<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> just<00:03:52.740> like<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.190> first

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
going you have to just like the first

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.360 
going you have to just like the first
one<00:03:54.270> or<00:03:54.420> two<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.810> that's<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.620> right<00:03:55.890> right
