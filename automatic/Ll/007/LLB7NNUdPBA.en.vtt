00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.540
 and now 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
 unique look Jurassic times 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.650
 for south korea the first 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.270
 world champion in 2009 was what and year 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.300
 later the Olympic title in Vancouver 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.580
 is a greatness in her country after that 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.130
 olypische play in vancouver was 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.630
 she was advertised the thousands everywhere 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.329
 people always followed her 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.440
 she did not have any peace and we saw that 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.300
 also back at the world championships 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.410
 which always held to the player 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.730
 to become 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.920
 when it was clear from two tons 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.079
 the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.909
 let's see 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.909
 music gisele 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.720
 triple roots hi mr combination 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 haha 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.030
 Others 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.230
 part 2 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.570
 upper body completely horizontal 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.160
 beautiful kilometer 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.120
 beautiful is what cell and temperaments 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 the passion 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.920
 beautiful what this south korean 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.970
 started here with the triple dudes 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.470
 where was something out of balance look and 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.730
 this allowed his second jump in the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.990
 day make do 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.580
 so who would say then miss the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.770
 combination but even the clarity of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.590
 mind to afterwards after this triple flip 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.120
 yet to make the leap second 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.090
 yes it still saves just one point two 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.550
 points that you would otherwise ignore and then 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 came the triple dual axel that 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.870
 was good too 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.040
 but from his pirouettes paper laws 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.730
 really like 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.359
 great class this is the fitting series 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.909
 if it 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.909
 for last element 6 element 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.639
 third was in 2007 were image coming 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.699
 championships years later source again 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.199
 and so in 2009 the title and previous one 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.780
 year silver the she has both that 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.600
 You will have gold silver and bronze twice 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.449
 bronze even the question is what it is now 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.350
 and that will be decided tomorrow afternoon 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.740
 at 2:30 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.729
 you all 3 to half past three in the final 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.979
 reliable cure and that would certainly be added 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.889
 65 point 91 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.180
 and that is the highest so far 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.320
 to score 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.320
 status in the first place 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.780
 that's a van der aart suit
