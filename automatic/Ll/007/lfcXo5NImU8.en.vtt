00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 a little need for speed track 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.130
 that is, I will do it all a little later 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.460
 in the last years I would 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 I am not completely crazy about one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.859
 Jahr is now doing everything with tracks 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 through up to 9 and I start with that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.010
 need for speed most wanted war and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 Although because of us , I have to say 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:36.320
 you can now be in yes for example 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.040

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.520
 but need for speed track will be yours 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 lists do not, however, get websites 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.350
 out of that then on the link what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 I gave you and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 de facto me just on the left 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.620
 I'll give you what we give you too 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.290
 meet the girl of his dreams no matter 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.880
 What does that mean ? 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.140
 Just click here on download year is in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.260
 5.7 and 20 gb but that does not mean much 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.490
 At the time I did not download 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:25.650
 because you never check it playful 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.250
 most wanted lsc point yes I have exactly 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.440
 the same 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.440
 then he opens once 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.149
 praised after 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.340
 I know you gave it to you, too 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.930
 grabs me so and I invite just in the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:52.700
 inside one more video hello 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.780
 can you do hello so sometimes 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.429
 I'm really on the eggs again 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.640
 then you should have this arrangement in it 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.640
 his 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.200
 I look the same 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.140
 [Music] 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.729
 ok then he presses on this folder then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 you have everything in it already 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.070
 you do not have to do anything anymore 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 that means only opening this folder 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.870
 enter winrar and here rather what yes 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.470
 can also do as an administrator 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.470
 but does not go out okay 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.690
 well no matter 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.680
 so 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.810
 Well then he still presses 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.390
 double- click on this need for speed nfs 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 13.6 this would have to be here 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.330
 the whole game should load the finished 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.520
 were loaded 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.510
 I promise you the game is 100 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.010
 percent if you have to go left 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 You wait until the game is finished loading 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.660
 But now is a matter if you 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.070
 this video 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.470
 if you play the game again 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.760
 wanted to play something with it 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.210
 this thing here run again 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.240
 can remain merely saved the zeugs 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.680
 means nothing loses your game 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 data speak here does not lose anything 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.230
 did your game then you have now 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.080
 finished playing because the next day 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.600
 play again just pushes 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.880
 again it is waiting that has stapled 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.560
 also need for speed here again the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.660
 Real press wait for it again 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.470
 has loaded and you can continue playing 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.940
 have stopped that you have the game 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.530
 right now we just finish yours 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 Stream from the pc card, it is clear that it 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.390
 not saved then if you 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.390
 go back on it 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.410
 then also the need for speed exit 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.300
 but before that a stromer internet 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.920
 I have not bought now 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.660
 if your stream is just gone , for example 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.860
 power failure or something and you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.270
 I want to play again the next day 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.440
 It starts with the logical way 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.660
 again from the beginning because they are not 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.860
 saved properly 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.340
 quit and then i would say it was 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.840
 even with this war and what have 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.340
 I suffer that if it is not 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.350
 I have to work completely 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.239
 urgently one like if it works 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.550
 and you liked that now whether it is 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.260
 was detailed but to show that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.560
 she wanted to support me and then she was 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.810
 it's actually here again 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.010

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.180
