00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
breath so I I started this journey I'm

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.219 
breath so I I started this journey I'm
exploring<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> change<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> body

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
exploring how can you change the body

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
exploring how can you change the body
change<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> brain<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.659> discovered

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
change the brain and I discovered

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
change the brain and I discovered
through<00:01:13.439> breathing<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.939> much

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
through breathing that there's so much

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630 
through breathing that there's so much
we<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:17.310> most<00:01:17.490> people

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we can actually do and what most people

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
we can actually do and what most people
will<00:01:17.939> tell<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.630> breathing<00:01:19.110> like

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
will tell you is that breathing like

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
will tell you is that breathing like
three<00:01:20.130> breathe<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.820> good<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.180> breathing<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
three breathe is good but breathing is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.399 
three breathe is good but breathing is
stressful

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
stressful

on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> exhale<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> key<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> relaxation<00:01:29.159> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
on the exhale the key to relaxation is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
on the exhale the key to relaxation is
in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> exhalation<00:01:30.570> remember<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
in the exhalation remember that and it

you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:15.040> train<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.489> lungs<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.780> freedom<00:02:17.140> we

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
you can train the lungs so in freedom we

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.770 
you can train the lungs so in freedom we
train<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.860> lungs<00:02:18.069> beyond<00:02:19.000> normal<00:02:19.510> capacity

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
train the lungs beyond normal capacity

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.780 
train the lungs beyond normal capacity
and<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:20.830> also<00:02:20.980> train<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.489> below<00:02:21.819> so<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:23.790> pump

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and we also train it below so we pump

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.000 
and we also train it below so we pump
the<00:02:24.910> lungs<00:02:25.090> full<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.720> rolled<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.050> exhale<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the lungs full and rolled up exhale and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.400 
the lungs full and rolled up exhale and
we<00:02:27.100> go<00:02:27.250> deep<00:02:27.459> into<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.819> ocean<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> was

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
what we do in freediving an extreme

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.840 
what we do in freediving an extreme
breath-holding<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.190> we<00:03:58.280> actually<00:03:58.430> change

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
breath-holding is we actually change

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.130 
breath-holding is we actually change
than<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.240> you<00:03:59.420> can<00:03:59.600> change<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.900> blood

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
than that you can change the blood

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.630

structure<00:04:00.440> we<00:04:00.710> get<00:04:00.830> more<00:04:01.010> red<00:04:01.190> blood<00:04:01.370> cells

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
structure we get more red blood cells

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.060 
structure we get more red blood cells

that was introduced to the history of
ancient<00:04:31.760> traditions<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.260> breathing<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.860> I

ancient traditions and breathing and I

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.520 
ancient traditions and breathing and I
was<00:04:34.520> introduced<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.060> pranayama<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.900> secret

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
was introduced to pranayama the secret

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.860 
was introduced to pranayama the secret
science<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.040> breathing<00:04:37.490> which<00:04:38.210> also<00:04:38.540> has<00:04:38.840> a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
science of breathing which also has a

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.810 
science of breathing which also has a
large<00:04:39.200> part<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:40.100> deals<00:04:40.280> with<00:04:40.490> breath

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
large part that deals with breath

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.750 
large part that deals with breath
holding<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:42.110> all<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.040> benefits<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.640> you

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
holding so all the benefits that you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.250 
holding so all the benefits that you
actually<00:04:43.940> came<00:04:44.270> from<00:04:44.330> breath<00:04:44.690> holding<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
actually came from breath holding and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.810 
actually came from breath holding and
from<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.650> mindful<00:04:46.070> control<00:04:46.370> because<00:04:46.700> the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
from the mindful control because the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.540 
from the mindful control because the
link<00:04:47.030> between<00:04:47.210> pranayama<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:49.160> take<00:04:49.400> the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
link between pranayama is to take the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.130 
link between pranayama is to take the
body<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:49.910> connect<00:04:50.360> with<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> mind

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
body and connect with the mind

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.230 
body and connect with the mind
so<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.710> pranayama<00:04:52.070> is<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.370> fourth<00:04:52.640> step<00:04:53.060> in

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
so the pranayama is the fourth step in

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.290 
so the pranayama is the fourth step in
yoga<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.780> heat<00:04:53.960> steps<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.500> yoga<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:56.000> put

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
yoga the heat steps in yoga and I put

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.570 
yoga the heat steps in yoga and I put
all<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.600> knowledge<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:57.050> into<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> book<00:04:57.860> which

book in the sense that it's a step by
step<00:05:04.550> guide<00:05:04.580> but<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.150> took<00:05:05.390> all<00:05:05.540> this

themselves<00:05:35.810> but<00:05:36.080> what<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.290> found<00:05:36.500> out<00:05:36.740> was<00:05:36.979> that

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
themselves but what I found out was that

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.070 
themselves but what I found out was that
it's<00:05:37.310> impossible<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.880> serve<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.510> many<00:05:38.570> people

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
it's impossible to serve so many people

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.510 
it's impossible to serve so many people
we're<00:05:39.229> about<00:05:39.380> seven<00:05:39.740> billion<00:05:40.040> people<00:05:40.070> not

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
we're about seven billion people not

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.150 
we're about seven billion people not
already<00:05:40.880> build<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.300> course<00:05:41.540> but<00:05:42.169> it's<00:05:43.010> an

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
already build of course but it's an

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.909 
already build of course but it's an
expanding<00:05:43.760> world<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.600> thought<00:05:45.139> why<00:05:45.410> not<00:05:45.440> let

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
expanding world so I thought why not let

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.529 
expanding world so I thought why not let
people<00:05:46.280> connect<00:05:46.610> when<00:05:46.789> they<00:05:46.940> want<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.270> train

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
people connect when they want to train

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.300 
people connect when they want to train
