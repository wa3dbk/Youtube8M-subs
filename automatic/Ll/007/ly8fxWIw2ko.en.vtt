00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.900
 jbe this bowl you 'll be good I'm 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.730
 sure it will be a beautiful not good 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.420
 Okay 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:20.810
 no but it's okay it's okay 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810
 not serious 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.750
 [Applause] 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 you only have the figure that appears 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.470
 when the bise boom deaf and studies 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.150
 that we can set how are 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.650
 all the figures can be 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.900
 curves may parameterize but what 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.590
 I mean it's a curve 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.489
 or parameterize interesting lived and that 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 do they mean us 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.759
 [Applause] 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.250
 source 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 so IMHO to see the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.040
 face of the court it would be a good 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.220
 curve set in 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.740
 in fleece yeah I 'll be fine maybe 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 as if I had forgotten to now 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.960
 riches is a bit weird but the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.180
 mattner assures armand still in his 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.100
 German revelations his family his 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.260
 trouble math 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 a haven of peace for him and psycho who 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.500
 market 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 obviously the fun that fills youpi 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.970
 yeah I do not have a lot of this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 story I'm restoring them assarid him 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.550
 a lot of people then think that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.550
 Jonathan and the ts who sleep 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 quietly would be a lot less 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.079
 [Applause] 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:13.290
 but keeping dogs did you read the ultimate 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.140
 sure this is where I would say 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 that I did not regret that they are coming out 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.319
 at the first ball now I 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.280
 start to the next I told you 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.280
 that they would make me regret 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.150
 [Applause] 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.920
 and that's why it's always 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
 think about restoring sports nuggets 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.890
 a bit early because the English parade 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.720
 if we had to think about restoring because we 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.040
 lose it all laughs not enjoy it for 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.950
 but no we do not work to enjoy it 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.690
 for to fart hate a clown by 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.790
 example after that there is this spiral 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.160
 infernal and you put to lose 5 bp 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.840
 easy 5 pp yet valuable for any 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.030
 a catch it's me you finished the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 of affinities betis did we have a 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.730
 little bit it's not good will and corn 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.200
 at most and June I have already planned plenty of 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.340
 search were not yet granny in 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.290
 may not need it 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.810
 oh yes actually that's where I have not 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:22.420
 you known to be listened yeah yeah 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.420
 if given beaten 10 draws 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.670
 me with the group x ice also get 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.090
 deceive the attak but not over it 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.459
 market 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.150
 for his last beautiful brunette he wanted 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.750
 that it works 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.370
 see it's the nice ones obviously with 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.709
 the rosiÃ¨re so the man has no 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.090
 chance of survival but thank you the cup 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.049
 but you can not even imagine how 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.980
 point I'm happy here that's it 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.430
 three times in a row that he wakes up 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.430
 still in one turn notice 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.150
 this remains a beast 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.050
 it's hunting is a beast 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.300
 [Music] 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.650
 [Applause] 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.659
 [Music] 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.299
 in addition always this idea that we can 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.310
 make a mistake is not right 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.280
 thank you they're landing to sleep that makes 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.510
 pleasure then you have to know that to get 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.160
 wake up so israel is always from 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.630
 four members of the three towers and if not 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.459
 between each round it's 10% chance 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.600
 that they wake up guys to say a 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 little hard with three times in a row 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.020
 single turn 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.020
 it's a lot 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.069
 [Applause] 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.069
 [Music] 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.530
 [Applause] 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:43.740
 the curve set it would be nice 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.740
 during the gall cos that six that I'm testing 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.390
 what I mean there are some tricks by 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 example we see well that comes back in the 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.560
 figure that he has an old idea and 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.930
 tangents it is on sale at the origin of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.720
 puppet I think it's well worth it for 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.590
 you but what does it say I understand 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.590
 students 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.190
 it's not an important leap 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.100
 is really happy and - 1 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
 respectively since obviously this is 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.009
 his life from the tribune trick so there is 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.360
 full of symmetry everywhere which is what 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.550
 you feel i will recover kaka 4 here 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.530
 I was physically right 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:32.669
 for the moment, you have to catch it 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:35.940
 it will be the math bonus yes but 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:42.180
 I have to catch the game I see 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.919
 well capture in 26 2 yes so that 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.250
 I could have finished in one video 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.660
 ready 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.789
 no one will catch it is the 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.110
 good ibis bowl base I trust 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.390
 you 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:01.100
 go ahead 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:03.460
 yeah but yeah but but that's 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.690
 not just me who believed in a month 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.790

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.150

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.880
 to reach 17 minutes it's going to be a 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.100
 epic moment
