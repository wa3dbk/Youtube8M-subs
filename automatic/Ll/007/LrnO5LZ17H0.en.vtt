00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi to all the boys and welcome up 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 elite gaming welcome to this new one 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 video on destiny in the case of wolves in the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 elders' prison at level 35 e 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.969
 Today I want to give you some advice 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 to be able to kill in the shortest time 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 possible scholars the final boss more 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.820
 precisely to be able to kill him in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.070
 just a minute and we'll be clear right away 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.539
 without using bugs and even glitches 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 because as far as I know they have none 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 still found what you need to do 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.180
 before going to fight scola will be 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 have a titan with the super loaded 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.920
 charge and active light weapons to have 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 all a heavy weapon a rocket launcher with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 give him sunsets with ammunition at 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 maximum and heavy synthesis ready 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 to be used what you will need 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 do it will enter the arena wait 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 that the presentation film by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 all end up turning around 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.640
 left and run all the way 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 now you split into two while the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.329
 Titan will take care to position the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 bubble exactly as you will see it in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.680
 course of this video the other two that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 I stress the class that is not relevant 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 will use it would be preferable to have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 even a sorcerer a hunter on the way 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.780
 of their super loads but it is not so 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 as important as Titan will have to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.409
 worry about killing them more 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.630
 quickly the servant a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 invisible servant you will see more or less 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.439
 the shape that will come out in that area 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 just at that point from that door e 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.680
 which will also have relatively little life 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.570
 so it will be easy to kill him 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.759
 once killed, you can finally do it 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 give it to school so everyone in the bubble 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.420
 of the titan all that is the zi hand 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 and in turn using light weapons 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 making better use of weapons of the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 light exits fired misseri just there 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.130
 you have exhausted recharged immediately with the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 heavy synthesis and down to shoot again 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 more or less when he drains he will know half the life 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 will start spurring mines for the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 moment you ignore the hardly you see 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 which drains known has little life on 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.470
 possibly a hunter if there is one 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.149
 activate the super loaded and start a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 fly using the speed precisely 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.899
 of the attacks of the blade in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.579
 direction of mines in the case of shoulder pads 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.470
 those far away precisely because this 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.030
 even once he has been killed, school 6 then 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.549
 once all the enemies will be 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.290
 dead twice you will have to do 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.270
 the critical goal that consists precisely 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.070
 in conquering in disarming these 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 It is then is better than when it starts 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.790
 to die down on one possibly the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.099
 hunter precisely because the most agile 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 he starts to walk away because of it 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.690
 I want to remind you that you can also ok 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 kill school if you don't take it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.110
 the mines lose so it seems to me 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.510
 should take the right precautions 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.090
 Once you disarmed all six mines 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.740
 3 and 3 you can finally go below 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.660
 the prison of the elderly to withdraw the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.090
 your treasure which will consist of one 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.800
 shader an emblem is a ship of course 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.990
 this unfortunately provided for by this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.330
 activity or you have more armored the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.100
 armed core is an ethereal light then 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.320
 guys in conclusion this a parer 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.000
 mine is the fastest method here effective 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.020
 to be able to kill scalas in the minor 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.550
 possible time 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.440
 I certainly do not doubt that there 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.210
 may also be other strategies a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.800
 if you wanted to get rid of it in just one 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.050
 this minute without a doubt is the method 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.520
 better on my part so everything like 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.300
 as usual I want to thank you for the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.830
 your attention 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.990
 I invite you to leave me your feedback 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.920
 with a comment, please sign up if not 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.720
 had still done 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.220
 share this video with all 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.600
 your friends and lovers of Lestini e 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.810
 we feel at the next goodbye to 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.810
