00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.810
 Hello 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.100
 and in this little video I am 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.720
 I will say 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 what can be learned from the old does not see the field 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.159
 just say it is not working one year 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.159
 he is a worker 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 in principle, they have already outlived their 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.650
 but came to replace them 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.179
 more 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.279
 advanced 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.890
 turntable 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 Well, let's see what is here and here 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.059
 have a power supply 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.100
 than he doesn't have 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 May 10 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.710
 good set of voltages 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.590
 plus 5 will be fired at 12 volts 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.810
 3 3 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.810
 minutes twenty one 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.520
 judging by what is written in the case 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790
 therefore it was suggested to be provided 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.960
 20 of total power in total power 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 there is still a twist attack 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.960
 may come to court 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 here it does not connect 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.850
 eye of electronics 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.030
 we are here 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 There is nothing interesting in principle 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.520
 Well, actually sdhc 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 here here is how you see there are already three 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 a little motor 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 they are in principle 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.580
 quite that is interesting work 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.910
 5 volt behavior 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.600
 further 5 is 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.010
 but nonetheless 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.170
 son of the chains that's all the best there is that 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.160
 burrow 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
 10 20 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.320
 pretty good 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.620
 by sight 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 It can be useful 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.759
 the reason here was such a disk 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.379
 caribbean sea 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.049
 confused with him 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.129
 Little 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.159
 that's all 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.539
 and another body 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.519
 basically 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.269
 but we do not know why customs 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.329
 apply 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.229
 saw everything like a politician 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 still do not like it does not happen 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.009
