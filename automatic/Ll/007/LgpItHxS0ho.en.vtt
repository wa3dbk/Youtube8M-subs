00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
done as you can see the tomatoes have
dissolved<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> dry<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
water and we're going to cook it on a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
water and we're going to cook it on a
high<00:01:08.400> heat<00:01:08.640> once<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.210> done<00:01:09.420> we're<00:01:09.659> going

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
high heat once that's done we're going

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530 
high heat once that's done we're going
to<00:01:09.869> add<00:01:10.110> oil<00:01:10.820> we're<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> add<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to add oil we're now going to add the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
to add oil we're now going to add the
baby<00:01:13.229> spinach<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> pot<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.820> looks<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
baby spinach to the pot it looks like a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.499 
baby spinach to the pot it looks like a
lot<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.810> once<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.259> becomes<00:01:16.790> hot<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> starts

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
lot but once it becomes hot and starts

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
lot but once it becomes hot and starts
some<00:01:18.799> cooking<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.820> settle<00:01:21.119> down<00:01:21.920> we're

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
some cooking it will settle down we're

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
some cooking it will settle down we're
going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> cook<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.000> medium<00:01:24.330> heat<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
going to cook this on a medium heat and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.450 
going to cook this on a medium heat and
as<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.340> spinach<00:01:26.850> becomes<00:01:27.360> lower<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.110> softer

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
as the spinach becomes lower and softer

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
as the spinach becomes lower and softer
it<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.909> releasing<00:01:30.030> its<00:01:30.420> own<00:01:30.540> water<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it will start releasing its own water so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.649 
it will start releasing its own water so
we<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> add<00:01:31.740> any<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> moment

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
we don't have to add any at the moment

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
we don't have to add any at the moment
as<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.310> lot

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
as you can see there's really not a lot

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.480 
as you can see there's really not a lot
of<00:01:35.759> spinach<00:01:36.150> left<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.950> released<00:01:38.280> its

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of spinach left and it's released its

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
of spinach left and it's released its
water<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.030> haven't<00:01:39.390> had<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.659> add<00:01:39.810> any<00:01:40.200> for

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
water so we haven't had to add any for

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
water so we haven't had to add any for
those<00:01:41.369> who<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> dish<00:01:42.450> with
