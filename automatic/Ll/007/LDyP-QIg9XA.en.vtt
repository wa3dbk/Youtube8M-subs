00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
soft as you can see it's not going to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.490 
soft as you can see it's not going to
protect<00:03:15.120> anything<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:15.840> quite<00:03:16.049> nice<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
protect anything but it's quite nice to

eighty<00:05:59.440> percent<00:05:59.740> of<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.100> music<00:06:00.430> is<00:06:00.580> just

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
eighty percent of the music is just

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.810 
eighty percent of the music is just
currently<00:06:01.260> cut<00:06:02.260> out<00:06:02.560> or<00:06:02.950> like<00:06:03.130> faded<00:06:03.700> out

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
currently cut out or like faded out

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.969 
currently cut out or like faded out
almost<00:06:04.419> like<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:04.660> monocle<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.410> that's<00:06:05.830> pretty

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
almost like a monocle and that's pretty

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.560 
almost like a monocle and that's pretty
much<00:06:06.100> what<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:06.550> mutating<00:06:07.180> I<00:06:07.270> think<00:06:07.479> it's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
much what it is mutating I think it's

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.719 
much what it is mutating I think it's
imitating<00:06:08.020> a<00:06:08.140> monocle<00:06:08.590> so<00:06:08.979> to<00:06:09.039> click<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.550> to

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
imitating a monocle so to click it to

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.310 
imitating a monocle so to click it to
say<00:06:09.910> no<00:06:10.210> I'm<00:06:10.360> not<00:06:10.510> on<00:06:10.570> a<00:06:10.750> cool<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:10.990> listening

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
say no I'm not on a cool and listening

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440 
say no I'm not on a cool and listening
to<00:06:11.350> music<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:12.280> unfortunately<00:06:12.700> my<00:06:13.150> first
