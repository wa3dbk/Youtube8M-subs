00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.070
 hi friends of train the review dotcom 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.010
 I am David and today I want to make a 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.000
 comparative between the new the sportiva 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.269
 Wildcat 3.0 are up here with the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.910
 old the sportiva wildcat 2.0 that are 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.859
 you're down here as you can see from 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.800
 input the design has logically 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.140
 changed and also changed the upper 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.270
 but let's go in parts and start 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.750
 by the sole of my right hand always 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.290
 the wild cat in blue the 3.0 the new ones 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.320
 As you can see, it sounds exactly the same with 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.340
 bending in blue which is the friction ate 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.060
 which is the rubber that lasts longer than the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.250
 casa la sportiva that yes also that takes 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.500
 less but I remind you that this 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.720
 sneaker these boats are a model 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.090
 intended to train a very model 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.210
 comfortable therefore we have equal sole 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.900
 let's go to the midsole look 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.820
 It is also exactly the same 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 fix with a drop of 12 mm os 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.800
 I remember they are stockings now of these 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 walqa 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.020
 in both version 2 and version 3 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 and the chassis that covers this entire area 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.880
 of the heel as you can see here also 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.899
 both in some 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.399
 exactly as in the others 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.579
 equal therefore all this part of 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.530
 down that has not changed at all and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.020
 we are now really going to the part that most 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.539
 has changed that is the part of the upper 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 to start the new huacas set 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.439
 one of the big differences is this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.819
 toe has been removed entire area 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.549
 rubber lightening the fixes just goes up 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.479
 a little the sole and has been incorporated 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.020
 here is this layer this protection of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.330
 as a kind of synthetic skin that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.070
 It protects but at the same time it gives a lot of comfort 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.650
 as you see 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 and a lot of lightness another of the things that 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.030
 it has also changed basically is that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.870
 I'm going to teach you in this part 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.860
 inside 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.630
 see how the upper one was already 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.720
 Coated with a kind of month but 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.690
 here has been pronounced much more has been 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.380
 put all these skin parts 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.320
 synthetic fixed 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.530
 and also one of the big differences 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.350
 of these shoes is the whole area of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.940
 the tongue fix the new model with 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.970
 a tongue 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.030
 very fine but every time protects with this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 protection with two pins in front 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.570
 for the laces and one 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.120
 here you have it at the top to 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.490
 that a template does not move 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.560
 tongue but very light that no 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.990
 here it incorporates the typical mesh so that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.690
 enter to prevent stones from entering 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.700
 protected so that we are not nailed 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.330
 bother us the laces while 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.330
 in the old version 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.350
 here you have the typical mesh so that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.560
 enter stones and a much more tongue 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.200
 classic thicker and I think it's 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.820
 rather heavier therefore this 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.630
 It would also be one of the biggest 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.800
 differences 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.470
 basically the collar this part of 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.870
 here is very similar I do not dare to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.170
 say if it has changed or not but it is very 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.740
 seemed very comfortable in any case 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.750
 another one of the great changes without a doubt the 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.360
 template 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.980
 remember that here I have the 'wild card' 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.440
 2.0 and here the new 3.0 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.959
 look how the template has been 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.690
 incorporated this new template of the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.140
 house olite the model mountain running 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.819
 version red version of thickness 5 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.129
 millimeters that we have won we have won 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.540
 in cushioning in absorption of 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.910
 impacts and then also on what is a 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.160
 Template that does not deform with the step 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.790
 of the kilometers before we had the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.290
 typical template of the sportiva with a 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.360
 double dimension a much harder area 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.489
 more that he picked up the foot and a part a 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.010
 a little softer but not much more 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.580
 set the thickness is also around 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.639
 at 23 millimeters and now with this one 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.259
 antibacterial template of olite has been 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.689
 won as you see much thicker 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.369
 also in the cushioning 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.989
 since I have them open I wanted you 

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:35.449
 also teach the lacing system 

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:38.029
 how these cords have been disposed of 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.279
 a way that they tighten the whole shoe 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:43.399
 equally from these four eyelets 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:47.239
 side and look how they get by 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:50.919
 fixed in and like when we tensed 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:53.989
 this whole part is pulling is 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.360
 grabbing our sneaker have been 

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:58.729
 also removed some seams of the 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.009
 inside part leaving the shoe without 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.620
 seams in this new version the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.050
 old version fix as 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.710
 reinforcements are seen here but I do not know 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.710
 see the laces 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.680
 the seam has been removed a little 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.270
 also here in the old version it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.610
 I noticed a little more the sewing of the 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.610
 tongue that as I have told you was 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.270
 something thicker therefore version 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.440
 new of the huaca 3.0 basically 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.130
 lightened 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.810
 quite lighten more cushioned and to the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.990
 final best sneaker and also I think 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.140
 that a shoe a little kinder in 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.350
 the sense especially the tongue of the 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.080
 lightness and the hardness of all this 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.620
 front part therefore friends this 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.120
 is the differences of the wildcat 3.0 with 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.810
 the old obsolete the wildcat 2.0 and 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.150
 so far a comparison I encourage you to
