so to be honest I don't really know how
to<00:01:04.909> call<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:05.420> effect<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.549> we<00:01:07.549> just<00:01:07.790> went

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
to call this effect and we just went

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.200 
to call this effect and we just went
with<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.710> metallic<00:01:09.710> text<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:10.549> kinda<00:01:11.060> looks

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210

with the metallic text but kinda looks
like<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.540> has<00:01:11.750> been<00:01:11.780> dipped<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:12.350> acid<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.130> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
like it has been dipped in acid so I

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.109

call<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.799> metallic<00:01:16.369> text<00:01:16.729> stepped<00:01:16.970> in

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
call it the metallic text stepped in

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.899 
call it the metallic text stepped in
acid<00:01:17.539> so<00:01:18.530> anyway<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.190> going<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.610> show

you how to do it so we have our text

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.389 
you how to do it so we have our text
here<00:01:23.659> go<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.259> our<00:01:24.440> layers<00:01:24.649> window<00:01:24.890> sandecker

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
here go to our layers window sandecker

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.690 
here go to our layers window sandecker
text<00:01:25.970> like<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.890> layer<00:01:28.190> go<00:01:28.670> to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
text like so go to layer go to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.580 
text like so go to layer go to
transparency<00:01:29.479> go<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.200> alpha<00:01:30.560> selection<00:01:31.159> so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
transparency go to alpha selection so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.380 
transparency go to alpha selection so
again<00:01:33.590> we'll<00:01:33.830> see<00:01:33.860> your<00:01:34.159> dotted<00:01:34.520> lines<00:01:34.700> along

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
again we'll see your dotted lines along

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.680 
again we'll see your dotted lines along
our<00:01:35.569> image<00:01:35.899> we<00:01:36.800> go<00:01:36.950> back<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.159> our<00:01:37.310> layers

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
our image we go back to our layers

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.320 
our image we go back to our layers
duplicate<00:01:38.690> our<00:01:39.220> text<00:01:40.220> layer<00:01:40.399> select<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
duplicate our text layer select the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.410 
duplicate our text layer select the
first<00:01:41.569> one<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.159> then<00:01:43.159> go<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.369> select<00:01:43.850> hit

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
first one and then go to select hit

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.940 
first one and then go to select hit
shrink<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.229> shrink<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:46.100> x<00:01:46.310> 1<00:01:46.640> pixel<00:01:46.819> like<00:01:47.659> so

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
shrink and shrink it x 1 pixel like so

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.270 
shrink and shrink it x 1 pixel like so
then<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.130> press<00:01:49.310> delete<00:01:50.409> okay<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.619> then<00:01:52.100> we

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
then we press delete okay and then we

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.699 
then we press delete okay and then we
select<00:01:52.520> our<00:01:52.819> second<00:01:53.690> order<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.350> placate<00:01:54.500> a

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
text layer go to filters then go to blur

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.790 
text layer go to filters then go to blur
and<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:58.970> gaussian<00:01:59.390> blur<00:01:59.569> if<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.649> would

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
and then gaussian blur if you would

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.400 
and then gaussian blur if you would
recall<00:02:01.099> i<00:02:01.369> made<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> video<00:02:01.819> about<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.509> but<00:02:02.869> it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
recall i made a video about this but it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.400 
recall i made a video about this but it
looks<00:02:03.679> like<00:02:03.800> glass<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:05.330> text<00:02:05.690> made<00:02:05.899> out<00:02:06.170> of

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
looks like glass or a text made out of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.790 
looks like glass or a text made out of
glass<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.670> kinda<00:02:08.090> works<00:02:08.330> um<00:02:08.599> with<00:02:09.410> metals

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
glass so it kinda works um with metals

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.619 
glass so it kinda works um with metals
as<00:02:10.039> well<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.729> kind<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.000> looks<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.270> glass

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
as well so it kind of looks like glass

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.050 
as well so it kind of looks like glass
but<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> also<00:02:12.290> looks<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.709> metal<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.940> way

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
but it also looks like metal so in a way

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.949 
but it also looks like metal so in a way
I'll<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.420> use<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:14.660> basic<00:02:15.410> um<00:02:16.000> effect<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
I'll just use this basic um effect to

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.180 
I'll just use this basic um effect to
have<00:02:18.110> my

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
have my

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.420 
have my
metals<00:02:19.850> but<00:02:20.120> anyway<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.960> hit<00:02:21.200> okay<00:02:21.560> i'll<00:02:21.830> just

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
metals but anyway so hit okay i'll just

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.950 
metals but anyway so hit okay i'll just
use<00:02:22.520> 10<00:02:22.880> by<00:02:23.060> 10<00:02:24.310> blur<00:02:25.310> radius<00:02:25.460> like<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.570> and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
use 10 by 10 blur radius like so and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.430 
use 10 by 10 blur radius like so and
then<00:02:27.080> keep<00:02:28.060> doing<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.510> Gaussian<00:02:29.960> blur<00:02:30.050> until

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
then keep doing the Gaussian blur until

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.200 
then keep doing the Gaussian blur until
you<00:02:30.710> are<00:02:31.070> satisfied<00:02:31.460> with<00:02:32.050> your<00:02:33.050> text<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.850> I'll

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
just go with this one next we merge or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.840 
just go with this one next we merge or
duplicated<00:02:38.900> layer<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.890> merge<00:02:40.160> down<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.820> our

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
duplicated layer so merge down with our

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.240 
duplicated layer so merge down with our
original<00:02:41.270> text<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.160> here<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.460> our<00:02:43.940> basic<00:02:45.250> metal

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
original text so here is our basic metal

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.850 
original text so here is our basic metal
text<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:47.450> kinda<00:02:47.810> looks<00:02:47.990> like<00:02:48.080> glass<00:02:48.470> too

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
text which kinda looks like glass too

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.600 
text which kinda looks like glass too
but<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:51.110> really<00:02:51.500> depends<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.010> how<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.220> apply

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
but it really depends on how you apply

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.580 
but it really depends on how you apply
the<00:02:52.730> Gaussian<00:02:53.240> blur<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:54.050> this<00:02:54.170> case<00:02:54.380> it

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the Gaussian blur so in this case it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.090 
the Gaussian blur so in this case it
looks<00:02:54.910> pretty<00:02:55.910> much<00:02:56.060> like<00:02:56.210> metal<00:02:56.830> then<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:57.980> go

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
looks pretty much like metal then we go

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.030 
looks pretty much like metal then we go
to<00:02:58.160> our<00:02:58.280> brush<00:02:58.580> tool<00:02:58.880> select<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.830> type<00:03:01.010> of

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
to our brush tool select the type of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.150 
to our brush tool select the type of
brush<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.300> we<00:03:02.450> can<00:03:02.660> select<00:03:03.140> from<00:03:03.410> three<00:03:03.920> types

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
brush so we can select from three types

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.350 
brush so we can select from three types
of<00:03:04.400> brush<00:03:04.690> first<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:05.990> gassy<00:03:06.470> ap<00:03:06.830> then<00:03:07.340> gags<00:03:07.880> big

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
of brush first is gassy ap then gags big

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.690 
of brush first is gassy ap then gags big
and<00:03:08.660> galaxy<00:03:09.290> small<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.950> really<00:03:10.160> depends<00:03:10.520> on

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
and galaxy small so it really depends on

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.910 
and galaxy small so it really depends on
you<00:03:10.820> which<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.600> want<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.740> also

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
you which you want and you can also

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.200 
you which you want and you can also
rescale<00:03:13.520> that<00:03:13.790> or<00:03:14.450> those<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.620> any<00:03:16.180> size<00:03:17.180> you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
rescale that or those to any size you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.250 
rescale that or those to any size you
want<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.650> go<00:03:18.770> with<00:03:19.000> galaxy<00:03:20.000> AP<00:03:20.540> oops

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
want so just go with galaxy AP oops

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.490 
want so just go with galaxy AP oops
there<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.190> go<00:03:22.340> galaxy<00:03:22.730> AP<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.270> just<00:03:24.170> use<00:03:24.290> this

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
there we go galaxy AP and just use this

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.630 
there we go galaxy AP and just use this
size<00:03:24.880> then<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:26.090> blot<00:03:26.420> across<00:03:27.110> our<00:03:27.530> text<00:03:28.100> like

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
size then we blot across our text like

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.540 
size then we blot across our text like
so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
so

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.260 
so
randomly<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.890> depends<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.430> guys<00:03:33.610> now

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
randomly so it depends on you guys now

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.690 
randomly so it depends on you guys now
you<00:03:34.330> would<00:03:34.540> want<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:35.050> just<00:03:35.620> blood<00:03:35.860> randomly

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
you would want this just blood randomly

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.570 
you would want this just blood randomly
as<00:03:37.330> long<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.690> get<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:38.080> like<00:03:38.580> burnt

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
as long as you get this like burnt

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.830 
as long as you get this like burnt
effect<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:41.380> so

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.869 

okay<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.590> if<00:03:47.890> you're<00:03:48.040> satisfied<00:03:48.220> with<00:03:48.790> this

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
okay so if you're satisfied with this

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.619 
okay so if you're satisfied with this
effect<00:03:49.860> okay<00:03:50.860> we<00:03:51.370> go<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.550> select<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.239> then<00:03:52.390> hit

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
effect okay we go to select and then hit

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.880 
effect okay we go to select and then hit
none<00:03:53.280> again<00:03:54.280> we<00:03:54.459> use<00:03:54.640> our<00:03:54.879> brush<00:03:55.120> tool<00:03:55.420> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
none again we use our brush tool and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.500 
none again we use our brush tool and
this<00:03:56.890> time<00:03:57.330> we<00:03:58.330> take<00:03:58.569> parts<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.230> our<00:04:00.030> texts<00:04:01.030> so

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
this time we take parts of our texts so

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.540 
this time we take parts of our texts so
it<00:04:02.440> could<00:04:02.590> be<00:04:02.650> anywhere

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.120 

just<00:04:06.210> make<00:04:06.990> sure<00:04:07.020> it's<00:04:07.770> kind<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.040> like

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
just make sure it's kind of like

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.640 
just make sure it's kind of like
disintegrating<00:04:08.940> or<00:04:09.090> something

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
disintegrating or something

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.970

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
and make sure that your brush color is

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.250 
and make sure that your brush color is
the<00:04:14.129> same<00:04:14.280> as<00:04:14.430> your<00:04:14.549> background<00:04:16.340> so

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
