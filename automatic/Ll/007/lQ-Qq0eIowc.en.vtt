you so that if you were ever in

you so that if you were ever in
situation<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> were<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.759> your

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
situation where you were you know your

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
situation where you were you know your
life<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.390> being<00:01:27.720> threatened<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.380> someone<00:01:28.710> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
life was being threatened or someone was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
life was being threatened or someone was
coming<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.790> quickly<00:01:30.210> pull

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
coming up on you you could quickly pull

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
coming up on you you could quickly pull
that<00:01:30.570> pin<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.680> start<00:01:31.950> screaming

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that pin and it would start screaming

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
that pin and it would start screaming
and<00:01:32.670> probably<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> person<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> leave<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and probably get the person to leave you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.550 
and probably get the person to leave you
alone<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.460> run<00:01:35.640> off<00:01:35.869> all<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
alone or or run off all right so I think

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 
alone or or run off all right so I think
it's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> great<00:01:38.130> idea<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.049> definitely

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's a great idea and it's definitely

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's a great idea and it's definitely
something<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.799> help<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.250> woman<00:01:41.400> stay

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
something that could help a woman stay

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.240 
something that could help a woman stay
safe<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.560> screaming<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.159> have

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
safe I think the screaming could have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
safe I think the screaming could have
sounded<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.990> real

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sounded a little bit more like a real

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
sounded a little bit more like a real
woman<00:01:46.590> screaming<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> real<00:01:48.180> woman

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
woman screaming or if it is a real woman

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.179 
woman screaming or if it is a real woman
screaming<00:01:48.720> maybe<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> different<00:01:49.530> screen<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.159> I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
screaming maybe a different screen but I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
screaming maybe a different screen but I
still<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.210> great<00:01:51.960> concept<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
still think it's a great concept and I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.280 
still think it's a great concept and I
know<00:01:52.890> they're<00:01:53.159> coming<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.820> other

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
know they're coming out with other

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.690 
know they're coming out with other
