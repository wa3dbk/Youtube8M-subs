00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.270
 hi everyone today we will tell you how 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.200
 use the charger sky 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.110
 Ersi 6650 and in the box you will find the very 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.320
 charging balancing connector 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.559
 instructions and wires and 6650 charges 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 nickel-cadmium lead batteries 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.520
 metal hydride elite polymer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 batteries up to six cans maximum 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 charging current 6 amperes 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 also you have the opportunity 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 regulate charge current from 1 to 6 amperes 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.290
 regulation is carried out by two 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 plus and minus buttons 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.450
 move through the menu by three 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 buttons in the type status tray 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.430
 and enter and now we take 4 cans 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 lithium polymer battery and plug 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 to charge it we include charging and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 connect the battery to it and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.720
 balancing connector 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 choose the mode we need it 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.710
 lithium polymer batteries 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 we expose the current optimal for us 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.929
 charge and number of cans in our 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 the battery we have them 4 pinch the button 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.719
 enter further charging will emit characteristic 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 the sound and the battery will start charging 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.350
 The advantage of this charge is that all 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.380
 process data is displayed 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.659
 namely charge current charge time 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 voltage across banks and quantity 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.499
 milliamp which charging poured it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 battery at shutdown 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.659
 charging again will produce a distinctive sound and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 the words full will appear on the left of the screen 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 before charging the battery go to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.219
 user mode set of programs and find the desired 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.100
 function it with go timer and capacity 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.049
 turn off both functions so that you can 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.599
 it was charging the battery over 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.119
 long time and to charge in 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.179
 lift a certain amount for example 4000 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.189
 milliamps did not turn off and now the most 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.709
 common charging errors 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.289
 battery when connecting wires to 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.779
 the battery lights up the inscription and reverse 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.580
 fields rite it means you are confused 

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:11.700
 polarity and you need to change 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.660
 connected wires in place of the second if 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.900
 charge mode balans you have a tan 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.330
 this inscription misfortunes and revol connect prs and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.700
 the battery does not charge then you need 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 connect the balancing connector also 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.440
 charging has discharge function 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.960
 battery with current up to 1 amp and mode 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600
 fast charles charger assembled 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.790
 has a high quality cooling system 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.860
 and all these necessary functions that you 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.740
 may need the price given 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.740
