00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
should be somehow balanced yep I think
that's<00:01:48.149> hanging<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:49.049> stable<00:01:51.020> okay<00:01:52.159> under

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
but the light will be very hard I want

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.510 
but the light will be very hard I want
to<00:02:11.990> soften<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.620> huh<00:02:13.450> for<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:15.220> I'm<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.400> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
but since the umbrella will spill it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.740

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
attached it with clamps too often our

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.620 
attached it with clamps too often our
clothes<00:03:09.440> hang<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.850> can<00:03:11.030> just<00:03:11.209> hang<00:03:11.480> it

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
clothes hang up so I can just hang it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.300 
clothes hang up so I can just hang it
Bob<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.470> anything<00:03:12.739> other<00:03:12.950> way<00:03:13.130> right<00:03:15.310> hang

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
Bob it's anything other way right hang

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.120 
Bob it's anything other way right hang
it<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.640> front<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.269> umbrella<00:03:17.799> right<00:03:18.799> wrap

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130
