00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
so you can see here we have the status

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.200 
so you can see here we have the status
bar<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> different<00:01:44.640> animation<00:01:44.909> right

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
bar we have a different animation right

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
bar we have a different animation right
here<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> also<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.049> battery<00:01:46.380> indicator

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
here you also have the battery indicator

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
here you also have the battery indicator
right<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
right over here now this is just kind of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.810 
right over here now this is just kind of
a<00:01:48.720> different<00:01:49.200> take<00:01:49.409> looks<00:01:49.740> pretty<00:01:50.159> similar<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a different take looks pretty similar in

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
a different take looks pretty similar in
my<00:01:51.299> opinion<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:51.899> sure<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> difference

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
my opinion not sure what the difference

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
my opinion not sure what the difference
is<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> battery<00:01:54.030> indicator

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
is other than the battery indicator

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
is other than the battery indicator
maybe<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.229> difference<00:01:55.350> right

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
maybe that's the only difference right

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
maybe that's the only difference right
there<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.579> scroll<00:01:56.850> down<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
there but if we scroll down here you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
there but if we scroll down here you
have<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> circle<00:01:58.350> 8<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> show

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have the circle 8 and it's going to show

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
have the circle 8 and it's going to show
you<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> loading<00:02:00.930> animation<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.590> well<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you the loading animation as well as the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.639 
you the loading animation as well as the
battery<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.030> status<00:02:03.450> bar<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
battery and the status bar and really I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.630 
battery and the status bar and really I
mean<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.009> want<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> scroll<00:02:05.579> through

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
mean you just want to scroll through

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
mean you just want to scroll through
these<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.299> which<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.560> the

these and see which one you like the
best<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.789> once<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.420> decided

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
