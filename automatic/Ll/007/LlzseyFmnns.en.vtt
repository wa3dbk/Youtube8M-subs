just is thin and this whole thing here
is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.090> case<00:00:28.519> it's<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:30.119> nice<00:00:30.359> build

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

quality if it means much and get is a
little<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.329> switch<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.020> when<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> switch<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
little on switch here when you switch it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
little on switch here when you switch it
on<00:00:35.300> you'll<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> charging<00:00:37.020> light<00:00:37.050> come<00:00:37.320> on

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
on you'll see the charging light come on

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
on you'll see the charging light come on
over<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.280> see

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
over there I don't know if you can see

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900 
over there I don't know if you can see
that<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> camera<00:00:39.530> but<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> pretty<00:00:41.579> good

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that in the camera but it is pretty good

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
that in the camera but it is pretty good
you<00:00:42.270> also<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:42.840> button<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you also have this little button here to

you also have this little button here to
tells<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.520> charge<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> left<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
tells you how much charge is left on the

tells you how much charge is left on the
little<00:00:48.239> LED<00:00:48.570> strip<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.190> space<00:00:50.460> for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
little LED strip there this space for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.720 
little LED strip there this space for
the<00:00:51.149> camera<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> flash<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.579> case

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the camera and the flash the case

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.130 
the camera and the flash the case
doesn't<00:00:53.940> affect<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> flash<00:00:54.539> too<00:00:54.750> much<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
doesn't affect the flash too much it is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
doesn't affect the flash too much it is
not<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.940> our<00:00:56.940> usage<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.690> far<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> also<00:00:59.640> have

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not from our usage so far you also have

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.170 
not from our usage so far you also have
access<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> USB<00:01:02.039> port<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
access to the USB port right there and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
access to the USB port right there and
it's<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> USB<00:01:04.229> port<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's not the USB port right here to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's not the USB port right here to
charge<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> case<00:01:05.820> itself<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.340> have

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
charge the case itself and you have

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
charge the case itself and you have
access<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> volume<00:01:09.390> keys<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.840> well<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
access to the volume keys as well it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
access to the volume keys as well it
doesn't<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.670> also<00:01:11.880> worth<00:01:12.030> noting<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
doesn't it's what also worth noting that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.240 
doesn't it's what also worth noting that
it<00:01:12.510> doesn't<00:01:12.780> block<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.170> microphone<00:01:14.070> at

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it doesn't block out the microphone at

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.789 
it doesn't block out the microphone at
the<00:01:14.340> bottom<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.990> at<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> top<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the bottom or at the top so it is a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.390 
the bottom or at the top so it is a
really<00:01:17.009> nicely<00:01:17.280> designed<00:01:17.759> case<00:01:19.220> one<00:01:20.220> thing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
really nicely designed case one thing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.740 
really nicely designed case one thing
that's<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.700> no<00:01:20.820> indo<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> does<00:01:21.570> take

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's what no indo is that it does take

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460 
that's what no indo is that it does take
a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.990> while<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.650> charge<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.810> 1x<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a little while to charge the the 1x it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.630 
a little while to charge the the 1x it
takes<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.970> six<00:01:26.970> hours<00:01:27.180> totally<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> think

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
takes about six hours totally I think

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.569 
takes about six hours totally I think
according<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.500> manual<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:32.009> takes<00:01:32.430> about

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
according to the manual it takes about

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
according to the manual it takes about
six<00:01:33.060> hours<00:01:33.180> 30<00:01:33.450> minutes<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> have

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
six hours 30 minutes now if you have

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
six hours 30 minutes now if you have
your<00:01:35.450> 3g<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.460> basically<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:39.119> least<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.540> my

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
your 3g on it basically at least for my

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
your 3g on it basically at least for my
usage<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.350> takes<00:01:41.280> quite<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> while<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.180> charge

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
usage it takes quite a while to charge

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.520 
usage it takes quite a while to charge
it<00:01:43.369> just<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> quickly<00:01:44.729> show<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it just going to quickly show you how it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.609 
it just going to quickly show you how it
does<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> does<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.840> doesn't<00:01:49.049> charge<00:01:49.350> why

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
does what it does it doesn't charge why

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
does what it does it doesn't charge why
the<00:01:49.680> micro<00:01:50.250> USB<00:01:50.640> port<00:01:50.670> he<00:01:51.360> charges<00:01:51.720> why<00:01:51.869> these

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the micro USB port he charges why these

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
the micro USB port he charges why these
pins<00:01:52.680> right<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.960> which<00:01:54.960> basically<00:01:55.740> attached

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
pins right here which basically attached

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
pins right here which basically attached
to<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> pins<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> back

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to the pins right over here on the back

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.520 
to the pins right over here on the back
of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> One<00:01:58.439> X<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> might<00:02:01.079> possibly

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of the One X so yeah that might possibly

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.999 
of the One X so yeah that might possibly
be<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> reason<00:02:02.340> why<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.619> takes<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> while<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
be the reason why it takes a while to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.740 
be the reason why it takes a while to
charge<00:02:05.159> there's<00:02:05.490> also<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:05.939> outlet<00:02:06.479> for

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
charge there's also a little outlet for

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.919 
charge there's also a little outlet for
the<00:02:07.049> loudspeaker<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.780> is
