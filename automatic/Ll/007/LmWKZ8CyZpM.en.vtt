00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.430

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:10.039
 Wexford is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 a 1st 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.829
 After that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.829
 Guru Palladio 4 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 Dark gray 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.049
 We will hit the right and left right and left in the same order as the Level 1 Level 2 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.010
 Simultaneously 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.280
 I 'm sorry that the next time 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.720
 Yup 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 I will do the same thing once more 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:13.580
 Last good 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 voodoo d 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 Hmm 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
 war 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.710
 And the third 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.640
 q 's 9's 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.000
 And if Tam is moving 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.310
 What was Nakata? What was it 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.760

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.520

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.040
 In 333333 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.489
 A little 9 厘 デ ー 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.489
 that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:02.390
 If it is a 3 year visitor not usually used, maybe it may be used naturally 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:08.319
 I think there are a lot of people who don't use a 9-point or so for a bit in aqb 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.319
 I think it would be nice to have three in this three year old band 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.800

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.830

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.810
 voodoo 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.780
 If we take 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.780
 I think that it may be for the time being and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.710
 The fourth four cog a 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.370
