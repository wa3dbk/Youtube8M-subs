there's<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.690> slight<00:04:23.960> stinging<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.130> heat

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
there's a slight stinging and the heat

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.600 
there's a slight stinging and the heat

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
funny heat sensation that's just

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:49.450 
funny heat sensation that's just
stopping<00:04:41.639> all<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.909> chemicals<00:04:42.389> working

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
I'm just going to really apply this

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.280 
I'm just going to really apply this
neutralizer<00:04:55.910> just<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.480> make<00:04:56.660> sure<00:04:56.690> there's
