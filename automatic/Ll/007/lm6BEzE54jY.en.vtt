00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.970
 good to all to a good new video 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.910
 new patch so that the crops that 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.219
 basically, it adds different things 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.700
 one of them because it would be the way that is the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.490
 cause mode for the extinguishing mode in 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.410
 xbox 360 and in xbox one basically 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.500
 I started, it was launched some time ago 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.420
 days and as I say I do not have my 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.950
 layout a team with an xbox 360 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.140
 as to check that it would be a patch 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.790
 and that is already in available mode but 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.620
 basically according to charlie inter reports 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.930
 because it's all this is like that already so 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.700
 well do not continue to check it because 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.350
 is now released the patch for all not 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.270
 only for Americans with 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.010
 European repairs too and if not that 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.500
 I always guess that it will take a few 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.690
 minutes in on to launch it so 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.550
 good chaos mode is a pretty mode 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.650
 amusing, in fact, of the ones we have 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.810
 I liked them in modern warfare 3 is like 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.239
 the way to be like the mobile extinction 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.670
 normal but basically here then 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.020
 we will have tremendous chaos will come 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.210
 everywhere we will have to start 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.370
 kill accumulate multipliers and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.140
 they will get more than they will be on the ground 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.760
 and others in houses and all this kind of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.260
 things 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.050
 it's pretty cool it's a pretty mode 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.280
 quite funny the truth apart from 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.990
 this as the party also what 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.840
 add is the ability to buy the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.729
 new 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.950
 in micro of the efes we could say that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.500
 you know that he will sell the legend pack of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.439
 south for $ 399 in which 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.960
 So we will have customization 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.609
 skin of the character and so on then 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.159
 customization packs of different 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.439
 of different colors and others that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.420
 will cost about two dollars each 1 429 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.310
 and they will be a different 2 3 4 5 6 6 and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.530
 then apart from that, because the voice of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.649
 snoop dogg or the instructor that will be 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.030
 also then ports with 99 basically 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.549
 by the voices we will hear them when 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.220
 We had some network or do not have any 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.390
 field order in the battle good 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.679
 different sounds and others these with 99 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.799
 dollars I do not know how the price to me 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.629
 Well, I do not know if it's not, but I 'd buy good 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.719
 maybe that's because we're pretty cool 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.989
 but in the other one because I do not know if I 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.989
 would buy 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.380
 and nothing else I think anything else all that 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.910
 comes tons I notice that the patch does not 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.140
 have been launched with which they have been 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.940
 touched some weapon or something because the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.030
 we'll do it a lot later 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.740
 quite in throwing them the notes of the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.230
 patches and others this I do not know when 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.460
 will come to playstation 3 and because they are 4 the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.590
 we hope that they do not take long to 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.700
 put a new game mode so 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.470
 extinction because the truth that is a 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.360
 putada that they will take a month if it is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.590
 they're going to work a month so good 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.350
 we will see be announced on some date 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 for this but meanwhile those of one 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 and team 60 can enjoy them 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.590
 supposedly as well as nothing else 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.270
 kids ready and nothing has been everything we 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.270
 in the next video until next time
