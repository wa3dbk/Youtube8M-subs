00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
mean it's not this series in general

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.180 
mean it's not this series in general
it's<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:47.239> like<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.989> sort<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.380> storyline

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.790 
that sort of game play with Pokemon
mixed<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.760> it's<00:03:52.880> like<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.660> like<00:03:53.750> an<00:03:53.930> RPG

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
mixed in it's like it's like an RPG

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.380 
mixed in it's like it's like an RPG
strategy<00:03:55.280> game<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.730> gameplay<00:03:56.030> looks

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
strategy game the gameplay looks

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.750 
strategy game the gameplay looks
somewhat<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.140> mystery<00:03:57.980> dungeon<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:58.610> then

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
somewhat like mystery dungeon but then

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.729

think it's gonna be that big of a deal I
mean<00:06:12.690> it's<00:06:12.870> just<00:06:12.930> say<00:06:13.260> it's<00:06:13.710> pretty

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
mean it's just say it's pretty

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.189 
mean it's just say it's pretty
innovative<00:06:14.130> but<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.760> doesn't<00:06:15.210> really<00:06:15.360> give<00:06:15.960> me

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
innovative but it doesn't really give me

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.680 
innovative but it doesn't really give me
much<00:06:16.229> to<00:06:16.740> look<00:06:16.919> forward<00:06:16.979> to<00:06:17.610> at<00:06:17.849> this<00:06:18.090> point<00:06:18.270> in

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
much to look forward to at this point in

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.899 
much to look forward to at this point in
time<00:06:18.990> in<00:06:19.229> this<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:19.949> hope<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.430> see<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.639> lot<00:06:20.880> more
