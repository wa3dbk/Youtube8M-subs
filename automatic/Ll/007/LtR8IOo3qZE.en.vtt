00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
but that's me and probably not the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
but that's me and probably not the
majority<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.769> people<00:00:29.250> anyways<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
majority of people anyways this is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
speak I'm crunched with time so I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.700 
speak I'm crunched with time so I
couldn't<00:00:33.690> wait<00:00:33.899> till<00:00:34.110> after<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> got<00:00:34.500> done

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
gonna see but I'm going to try to have a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
gonna see but I'm going to try to have a
couple<00:00:40.680> sequences<00:00:41.100> showcasing<00:00:41.670> some<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
couple sequences showcasing some of the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959 
couple sequences showcasing some of the
animations<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.870> far<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> cargo<00:00:44.160> doors<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
animations as far as the cargo doors the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
animations as far as the cargo doors the
emergency<00:00:45.360> exits<00:00:45.719> air<00:00:46.320> stairs<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.219> type

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
emergency exits air stairs all that type

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.330 
emergency exits air stairs all that type
of<00:00:47.430> stuff<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.420> might<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:49.140> sound<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of stuff it might not sound that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.799 
of stuff it might not sound that
exciting<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> developers<00:00:51.449> spend<00:00:51.660> time

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
exciting but the developers spend time

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
exciting but the developers spend time
perfecting<00:00:52.289> features<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
perfecting features like that so the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
perfecting features like that so the
least<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.610> could<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.239> explore<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.260> bit

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
least I could do is explore a little bit

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
least I could do is explore a little bit
of<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.730> camera<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of how that can look on camera I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
of how that can look on camera I
originally<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> stick<00:00:58.620> only<00:00:58.920> with

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
originally was going to stick only with

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.299 
originally was going to stick only with
the<00:00:59.309> 737-200<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.719> video<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.920> may

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the 737-200 for this video but you may

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
the 737-200 for this video but you may
see<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.579> 72<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.090> triple7<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.019> somewhere

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
see a 72 or triple7 in there somewhere

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.719 
see a 72 or triple7 in there somewhere
again<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:04.920> done<00:01:05.040> filming<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.580> not

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
again I'm not done filming so I'm not

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
again I'm not done filming so I'm not
sure<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:06.060> that'll<00:01:06.330> go<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> possibility

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sure how that'll go but the possibility

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
sure how that'll go but the possibility
for<00:01:07.890> variation<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> got

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
for variation is there that's all I got

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.090 
for variation is there that's all I got
let<00:01:09.960> me<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.950> for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
let me know what you think and look for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.460 
let me know what you think and look for
something<00:01:11.280> new<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.670> UK<00:01:12.000> 2000<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.200> soon
