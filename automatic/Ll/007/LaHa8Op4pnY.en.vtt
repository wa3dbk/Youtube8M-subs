00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.320
 and I do not 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.500
 to see that it is very well today they make another 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.330
 what would become a new map where 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.610
 is a new review of maps in this 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.280
 case are several maps is a pack of 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.200
 survival maps very very cool is 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.239
 who I found on a page right now 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.970
 I do not remember what it was but anyway 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.850
 this basically because they are six maps 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.489
 although unfortunately the last map I 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.230
 one is missing because it can not or is if 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.200
 in the pack but I think it's a mistake to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.790
 be changing this mode the mobiles and 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.500
 good try to fix no can not 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.510
 but, well, I think that is to say, 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.580
 I should serve, I think that was good 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.120
 my mistake so less is they will see it for 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.100
 his father then this one as you see today I will say 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.949
 the review of five maps already has sixth 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.200
 I already told you what happened then this one 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.940
 can this be the first map of the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.820
 map map then good this is the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.680
 first map is called nightmare ' black 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.200
 level nightmare by entering the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.390
 Spanish then is a map where you 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.100
 would appear with that bed these fields the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.020
 true commented a small comment 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
 these maps would be great for example 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830
 If you want to make a new series of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.870
 Well, a survival map 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 and then I who appears in some of 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.880
 these and then you have nothing to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.890
 survive even if you are there rather not 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.800
 It's a lot like to appear here 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.870
 this one to survive here the truth that no 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.000
 he's very father for that kind of thing 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.640
 first truth that exists already well by 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.230
 example those in a series your rival and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.060
 because you want the Neider and instead of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.970
 go like a minecraft gamer did once 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.340
 because 117 ago will export to a level 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.050
 changed the map and then it came to a map 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.060
 of neider but much more is needed 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.030
 could that the real neder as they see 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.370
 it has like that things hills look great 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.380
 topics that in the car are not itunes and 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.150
 the balloons are here there are blogs dom and so 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.040
 You can also spend the night here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.310
 then well let's go with the next 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.280
 map and well that's the second map that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.080
 it's called the iron or is the island and the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.820
 it's really great because 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.620
 has half with a line and right now 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.780
 I realized the time is that it's great to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.250
 who also includes the temple 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.620
 from the jungle then I think it 's half 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 tropical island half jungle then 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.800
 well I just saw the temple of the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.300
 jungle or right now I realized because 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.860
 It says the review before but I did not like it 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.840
 so I started 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.250
 it's alright well great the truth to see 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.650
 let's see down here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.500
 despite good exported from obviously because 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.880
 does not have the traps that have pc 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.770
 so I do not think that this map is 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.370
 great to do a series in the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.010
 then good is like an island because 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.110
 obviously an island is something surrounded by 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.390
 water then here is the water is like 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.720
 that as I told you tropical for the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.820
 palmeros and then here to visit in back a 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.860
 little more then is the jungle then to 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.060
 see if it is very cool and then here is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.590
 the temple of the jungle in case you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.190
 interesting to go in some chapter to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.160
 get this stone to stone more enjoy 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.110
 and then around here is like a part a 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.330
 normal part is not much to see the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.370
 true then it 's good you need it 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.590
 great as for a series like that if 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.930
 would be good father then in the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.450
 subscribers would like then good 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.130
 we go with the following map yes good 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.070
 then this is the third map that 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.750
 llama la miro red covers what good the 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.360
 truth is that I do not know how it translates into 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.440
 Spanish I'm sorry but in the end this map 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.269
 the truth is that it is one of the most 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.600
 great things that I've seen in my career 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.940
 youtube one of the most working maps 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.890
 look how amazing it is that it appears 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.050
 from here then you have a bed by itself 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.510
 to sleep and everything is also great 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.400
 to survive or well simply if 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.620
 you need in a chair of your rival something 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.510
 as well as read and go to a giant cave 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.100
 then you can sell something and then here is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.900
 minerals there loustau 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.360
 there is everything the good thing is that for a 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.010
 cave imagine youtube good an advice 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.330
 for the one who takes it in which only 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.370
 also first and do not tell him 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.110
 convert a council look I advise you 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.940
 is the one who is watching the video if 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.890
 you have a youtube channel that makes a 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.190
 survival series in a normal world of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.100
 minecraft dÃ©ison 0.8 point 1 and then that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.250
 to measure go to the leader's map for 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.660
 the caves come from here and so good and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.980
 Well, I know if you want to go to a 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.650
 jungle you go to maps in the jungle 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.750
 that you make a mixture between all these 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.520
 worlds that you make fake portals and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.410
 people cut and from there go tenth 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 every time it would be fine but for 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.000
 a series his life would be incredible 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.619
 so then this one we're going from the next 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.389
 Map 

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:40.069
 and well we are on a map that 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.679
 it's called that I think the deep ocean 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.240
 yesterday it seems to me that that being in 

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:47.300
 deep I'm not completely sure 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.849
 then there would seem to be such an island 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.479
 and then you would have there to spend the 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.009
 night 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.740
 obviously also great as for 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.389
 survive and good summer is great the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.189
 truth is not that I can believe that what 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.659
 that I liked the pack less but good 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.909
 I do the review anyway because it does 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.409
 that is part of the pack and then I 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.509
 that I know to go down the water are 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.669
 good adventures all that has a lot 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.610
 what to see is not very cool the idea is not 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.469
 great not good the truth is that for 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.789
 Those who like it and I do not know to my taste 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.499
 it's good to the best for the taste of 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.139
 someone else loves it and everything and so 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.409
 review and everything up to a series on it but 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.300
 well finally we go to the next map 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.699
 simulated cruises this brings us to the last 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.379
 map and although since I told them that 96 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.789
 but this one of you want the fifth one since 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.039
 well I already explained it at the beginning of 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.219
 video that I could not google or rum and I do not know 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.709
 that finally this map are called trucks 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.680
 in English but I do not know how not if 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:41.400
 as it is called in Spanish good in order 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.919
 would appear here with a 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.080
 so you can survive this is from 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.509
 here yes that is pro to survive 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.729
 I would love it then let's say that 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.280
 appears is here then in his bed 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.740
 to be able to sleep, fiddle with an oven to 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.389
 can cook things and well the 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.310
 point is that here there are few 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.289
 two bridges I think so to be able 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.300
 to cross from one side to the other then 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.410
 good the other side and animals and everything 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.110
 so to climb 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.199
 well obviously there are two cows one 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.650
 cow of his daughter and then day and 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.960
 good for here because there is a tree is a 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.669
 nevada then good part which itself 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.580
 it's great all these new me 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.010
 they looked great except for this one 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.900
 type are the truth that they are not very 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.660
 parents but as good as our 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.789
 tastes give and does not generate personally 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.169
 I was very interested to make a 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.389
 series but all the others yes that 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.039
 They were great and well again 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.169
 sorry for not bringing that last one 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.930
 map that I do not know if it is moving or was my 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.160
 error but here we come to the end 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.310
 of the video because I hope that I have 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.360
 liked being like the moon light 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.550

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.770
