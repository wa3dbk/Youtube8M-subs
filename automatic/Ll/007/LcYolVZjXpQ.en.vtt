00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello and welcome to or 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.370
 tv today i want to give you one 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.570
 to introduce tracking at 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.849
 I have chosen the wild max 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.140
 at the company's border river brooks the 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.270
 Swedes have been valid for many years 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 as one of the best ax manufacturers of 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.470
 world and their tracking can be diverse 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.939
 you can use it to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.070
 For example, smaller trees can be used to relieve the strain 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.689
 fire wood making dwellings 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.130
 keep animals or just one 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.900
 hammer in the tent 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.400
 beyond that is the tool 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.220
 legally much less problematic 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.989
 as an example, a big knife it 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.160
 So there are enough reasons to do this 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.160
 to take a closer look soon 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.440
 As always, we throw one first 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.600
 look at the technical data the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.659
 Sound length of the game park is ball 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.579
 8 cm the blade provides an easy 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.429
 convex to cut especially for 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 Soft wood is the cutting edge 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.539
 has only a slight rounding what 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 both forestry and carving 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.520
 allows that bayern has over 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.729
 a medium sized bathroom at the bottom 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.380
 the cutting edge is just one 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.299
 small punch plate available 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 the only for very easy the hammer 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.860
 work can be used 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.860
 the style is by means of a wood and 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.840
 an iron wedge attached beyond 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.640
 are ears on the head of the ball 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.459
 Forged for additional 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.500
 ensure safety 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.810
 Overall, the wild marx is at 34 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.929
 centimeters in weight 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.929
 including the notes 6 185 grams 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.310
 we come to the material of the head of the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.070
 balls is hand forged 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.990
 made of carbon steel he takes one 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.600
 very good sharp and owns one 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.940
 good cut is, however, holiness 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.649
 it costs and therefore requires regular 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.850
 maintenance 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.040
 only the cutting edge is ground 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 The rest of the head is untreated 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.450
 leave 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.300
 the style of the game park is hickory 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.330
 wood-crafted kuri is very tough 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 durable and durable 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.239
 with the wall will cut in protection 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.239
 made of leather 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.000
 so now in the practice clearly so 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.190
 ball is made for rougher work 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.200
 so you can ball with the world market 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.570
 easily cut down smaller trees 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 and chop in pieces 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.060
 since a ball is very short I lead 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.130
 such work out in the hop if that 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.520
 times then go wrong in the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.560
 earth and not in his leg smaller 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.720
 Pieces are deposited at the farther 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.180
 split and then apart 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.190
 leveraged in this way you can be very 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.200
 small places thanks to the sharp blade 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.580
 of the ball, these can be quite easy and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.070
 be sprung up quickly 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.460
 so catch the small pieces easier 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.990
 fire but also other normal work 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.900
 can be done with the case of slightly 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.270
 because the closer you get to the head the more 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.550
 less power but more control 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.770
 so it was not that surprising 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.020
 even fine work with a little skill 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.280
 let carry out 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.990
 However, you come blessing size and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.320
 weight here at the limits of 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.780
 to highlight wildparks balls is the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.940
 very good sharpness of the example despite 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.940
 diverse work still possesses 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.130
 Let's go to the conclusion on the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.080
 operability that is very important 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.080
 good in the hand and is close to the head 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.180
 Balances the good fortification of the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.940
 head and a knock-off protection on a stick 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.650
 ensure a good security of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.870
 wood handle, however, could well 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 his grip 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.640
 either way is dealing with an ax 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 but always careful 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.310
 The leg can be worn in two ways on the belt 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.470
 be attached 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.080
 either one opens the cutting protection 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.100
 for the behind the belt and 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 close it again 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.810
 or you put the casual behind so 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.510
 the belt that it revealed on the sword 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.730
 Hang on for maintenance and care 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.710
 You have to spend some time in purchasing 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.710
 take because the steel is rusting 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.030
 Let's come to the conclusion of the wild max ball 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.630
 from grants forest buchs has us very well 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.880
 like 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.470
 the casual deals mostly larger 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.530
 work much faster and also 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.660
 more precise than a big knife 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.160
 but it is always so handy that too 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.100
 normal work to be done 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.870
 Thanks to sharp cutting edge and good 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.000
 Hand lay are even fine work 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.120
 possible and so does the wild max ball 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.620
 a wide range of applications from the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.290
 used materials are high quality 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.900
 and the processing of the ball is ob 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.360
 Size and weight are optimal for the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.480
 Mobile use below is the positive 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.360
 overall picture so is the grants forest 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.640
 professional world marx at around 65 euros 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.640
 to have is a real recommendation
