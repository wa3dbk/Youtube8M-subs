00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a little bit of glue right in the center

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.639 
a little bit of glue right in the center
of<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.339> like<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.510> I'll<00:01:00.660> start<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of it just like that then I'll start to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.630 
of it just like that then I'll start to
there<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.609> ribbon<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.570> around<00:01:04.250> might<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
there my ribbon all around might be so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
there my ribbon all around might be so
for<00:01:05.910> me<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.630> formula<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.380> serving<00:01:07.890> as

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
for me the formula will be serving as

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.810 
for me the formula will be serving as
the<00:01:08.580> center<00:01:09.120> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.020> flower<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> base

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the center of the flower and as the base

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.660 
the center of the flower and as the base
of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> flower<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.840> well<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
of the flower as well so that we can

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.380 
of the flower as well so that we can
accommodate<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> our<00:01:16.170> ribbon<00:01:16.620> all<00:01:16.830> around

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
accommodate all of our ribbon all around

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
accommodate all of our ribbon all around
it's<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.300> see<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.740> am

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's so now you can see that I am

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.540 
it's so now you can see that I am
actually<00:01:23.930> putting<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.290> ribbon<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.890> though<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
actually putting the ribbon as though it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.990 
actually putting the ribbon as though it
were<00:01:26.760> petals<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.660> flower<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.370> am<00:01:29.610> trying

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
were petals of a flower and I am trying

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.220 
were petals of a flower and I am trying
to<00:01:30.240> put<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.800> little<00:01:31.950> pieces<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.730> have

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
to put all the little pieces that I have

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.740 
to put all the little pieces that I have
so<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:35.160> actually<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.880> fold<00:01:36.479> them

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so that I can actually then fold them

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.830 
so that I can actually then fold them
and<00:01:36.990> start<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> form<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.010> flower<00:01:38.280> itself<00:01:41.840> now

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and start to form the flower itself now

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
and start to form the flower itself now
you<00:01:42.870> can<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.100> any<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:44.760> of<00:01:44.940> ribbon

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you can do this with any kind of ribbon

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can do this with any kind of ribbon
really<00:01:46.050> what<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.410> like<00:01:46.710> grosgrain<00:01:47.130> ribbon

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
really what I like grosgrain ribbon

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
really what I like grosgrain ribbon
because<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.830> has<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.860> texture<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.770> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
because it has a texture to it and it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.040 
because it has a texture to it and it
actually<00:01:52.979> makes<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.790> flower<00:01:54.030> pop<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.840> bit

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
actually makes a flower pop a little bit

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.520 
actually makes a flower pop a little bit
more<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.619> gives<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.160> another<00:01:56.490> dimension

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
more it gives that another dimension

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.520 
more it gives that another dimension
after<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.670> place<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.690> your<00:02:00.720> ribbon<00:02:01.259> or

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
after you have a place of your ribbon or

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.700 
after you have a place of your ribbon or
around<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.280> fall<00:02:02.580> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> piece<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> foamy

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
around the fall on the piece of foamy

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
around the fall on the piece of foamy
now<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.160> are<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> put<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.910> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.240> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

MU<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> center<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.380> then<00:02:07.830> start<00:02:08.190> folding

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
MU in the center and then start folding

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.080 
MU in the center and then start folding
the<00:02:09.899> petals<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> flower<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.120> this

actually<00:02:26.849> take<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.720> piece<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.930> felt

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
actually take a little piece of felt

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.400 
actually take a little piece of felt
instead<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> foamy<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.989> use<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.200> needle

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
instead of the foamy and use your needle

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.740 
instead of the foamy and use your needle
and<00:02:31.800> thread<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.670> actually<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.970> fold

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and thread to actually do this to fold

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.089 
and thread to actually do this to fold
your<00:02:37.250> petals<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.640> also<00:02:39.170> throw<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.380> into<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
your petals and also throw them into the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.949 
your petals and also throw them into the
flower<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.790> everything<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> don't<00:02:42.750> need

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
flower and everything so you don't need

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.350 
flower and everything so you don't need
glue<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:44.160> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.459> don't<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> hot<00:02:45.180> glue

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
glue and if you don't like the hot glue

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.539 
glue and if you don't like the hot glue
gun<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.599> can<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.110> use<00:02:46.349> superglue<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
gun you can also use superglue like this

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.600 
gun you can also use superglue like this
one<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.340> also

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
one that I have here and that can also

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.270 
one that I have here and that can also
accomplish<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.420> same<00:02:51.660> thing<00:02:51.989> as<00:02:52.290> using<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
accomplish the same thing as using the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.710 
accomplish the same thing as using the
hot<00:02:53.850> glue<00:02:54.120> gun<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.549> here<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.660> now

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
hot glue gun you can see here that now

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.589 
hot glue gun you can see here that now
we<00:02:58.110> are<00:02:58.500> almost<00:02:58.830> done<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.760> I'm<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.239> put<00:03:00.569> a
