lineups at all of these right some are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.160 
lineups at all of these right some are
shorter<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.479> longer<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:10.020> are

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
make a guess okay there's a long line up

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.040 
make a guess okay there's a long line up
a<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:24.060> line<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:24.600> medium-sized

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
a really long line up a medium-sized

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.570 
a really long line up a medium-sized
line<00:01:25.230> up<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.500> short<00:01:25.710> line<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.980> which<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.490> do

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
line up in a short line up which one do

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.320 
line up in a short line up which one do
you<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.760> for<00:01:26.910> well<00:01:27.060> first<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.660> go<00:01:27.870> finish<00:01:28.170> or

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
you go for well first I go finish or

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.240 
you go for well first I go finish or
there's<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.510> mistake<00:01:30.840> ah<00:01:31.050> would<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> get

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there's the mistake ah would that get

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's the mistake ah would that get
you<00:01:32.460> through<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.760> fastest<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you through the fastest can you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
you through the fastest can you
guarantee<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.670> thought<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
guarantee me the thought will get you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.700 
guarantee me the thought will get you
through<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> fastest<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.080> would<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
through the fastest one would think that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.540 
through the fastest one would think that
by<00:01:38.100> sheer<00:01:38.430> numbers<00:01:38.600> one<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.930> yes

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
by sheer numbers one would think yes

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.120 
by sheer numbers one would think yes
logic<00:01:41.550> dictates<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.960> unfortunately<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.010> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
logic dictates but unfortunately in this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
logic dictates but unfortunately in this
situation<00:01:44.670> common<00:01:45.060> sense<00:01:45.360> dictates<00:01:45.930> maybe

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
situation common sense dictates maybe

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
situation common sense dictates maybe
otherwise<00:01:47.250> maybe<00:01:47.730> I<00:01:48.150> mean<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.200> line

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
otherwise maybe I mean what is that line

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
otherwise maybe I mean what is that line
up<00:01:49.530> okay<00:01:49.800> we<00:01:50.010> have<00:01:50.100> four<00:01:50.280> people<00:01:50.580> four<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.300> what
