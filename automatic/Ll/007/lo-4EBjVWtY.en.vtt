00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.680
 everyone so today we 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 enjoy that I still have a little bit of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.469
 battery on macbook pro after the ad in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.670
 TV is done 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.679
 so I thought I was going to believe 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.470
 but the election is totally but stack 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 where I was going to fill my SD card but 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 will have less there is a little bit of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.590
 place so will take the opportunity to make a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.439
 little video where I had planned a moment 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.570
 I spoke with people on forums 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.199
 lady in line exhaust all that and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.289
 it is true that we ask ourselves several 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.250
 questions about exhaust line so 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.030
 scorpio brand that I do not see too much 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.879
 especially on the mt 0 7 that I have not too much 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.379
 seen I see rather due to tra in general I 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 see a lot of accra the line that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.809
 was out it seems like it was the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.640
 first inc were out normally 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.520
 the skins from Moldova'm not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.899
 very fan but so show you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.989
 concretely that these circus models is 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 in stainless steel finish 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.340
 that's the model I was talking about 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 several forms look no matter 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 so here I show you a little bit 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 quick start Gaulle and what then 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.430
 good it's not it's not me who goes up the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 line 1 I order everything at my 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.390
 dealer he would climb me if not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 it's jallet disassemble the bike it was going 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.990
 to be a puzzle but I never redo 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 that correctly one so the total is me 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.520
 returned to 1800 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.410
 eight years 10 820 euros so laying everything 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.410
 understood who is fine dan it's really 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.700
 Something 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.260
 six planes rather well what for 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 compare with the original pot that I have 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.140
 had my first bike ain 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.760
 so at first I did not know at all 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.010
 I was happy for her tour 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.979
 well there it was a little noise but 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.510
 I quickly realized when 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.860
 knows that doubling by motorcycles or that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.090
 has next to other motorcycle people some 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.619
 stuff like that it does not mean a big 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.759
 unemployed and the impression is 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.350
 nonexistent so I 'll be good tspo already 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.360
 by aesthetics because my first 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.190
 not necessarily very pretty either 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.090
 go in person m it is not explained 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.630
 necessarily and I'm not I was 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.209
 tempted by cram and it was not 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.270
 more fan of the look than that and I saw this 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.590
 little line there that I like a lot 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.680
 which pleased you which pleased me more 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.630
 early rather a lot and I looked for 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.070
 trot on youtube and it's true that in 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.100
 mines of three videos that are not 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.030
 necessarily very very good 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.680
 I could not really get an idea 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.790
 so we must not move 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.610
 I have between them Sunday to say I took 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.209
 minister ordered a new line that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.000
 could not be worse than that 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.770
 of origin what then 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.080
 I'm not disappointed I'm doing saga 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.640
 as in 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840
 three weeks I will have three weeks and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.940
 no fresno 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.530
 it's running great thomas 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.560
 raymond well we could believe that the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.970
 line and bassel a little more Basque 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.550
 the original line but did not protect it 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.640
 already rubbed a bit I've already faced 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.960
 two three times on this side 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.880
 and with that line there was no 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.090
 worries it's still the pacifier that has 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.290
 touched 1 the weight po I had nothing of the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.680
 everything there is nothing underneath is just a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.680
 little disgusting 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.730
 and here I am, my own like that 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 it is now 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.520
 Why 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 Oh 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.710
 so I specify that 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.310
 there is always the baby that their game 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.470
 mop it up because I think it's done 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.550
 still a lot of noise like that I 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.980
 do not know what it's going to give on the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.750
 video I do not have the sound at all 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.320
 that it's going to see this movie with a bo pro 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.700
 hero iii more so car that I have 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.350
 nothing better than that or the iphone 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.460
 good I think the bank or having 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.460
 sound rendering that alcohol 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.870
 so here I am afraid to do a little 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.480
 test on a line 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.280
 me on what it's worth the price kelkoo 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.150
 that the sound she can pull I hope 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.190
 it will be pretty representative sastre to 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.900
 this presentation 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.129
 here is the video 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.129
 we wanted to give birth
