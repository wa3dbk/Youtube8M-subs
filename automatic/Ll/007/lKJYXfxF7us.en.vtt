are bits and pieces of cords and if you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.210 
are bits and pieces of cords and if you
just<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.110> look<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.440> scale<00:01:46.830> as<00:01:47.100> you

that<00:01:54.570> scale<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:56.420> we're<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
that scale like this we're like this

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.180

more like this okay so now I'm going to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.620 
more like this okay so now I'm going to
break<00:02:04.370> them<00:02:04.520> down<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.760> little<00:02:04.909> bit<00:02:05.240> for<00:02:05.479> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630

break them down a little bit for you
let's<00:02:06.140> try<00:02:06.409> barring<00:02:06.979> across<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:08.390> highest<00:02:09.080> two

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
let's try barring across the highest two

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.690 
let's try barring across the highest two
strings<00:02:09.890> at<00:02:10.429> your<00:02:10.640> 5th<00:02:10.880> fret<00:02:12.280> your<00:02:13.280> let<00:02:13.459> annoys

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
strings at your 5th fret your let annoys

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:23.050 
strings at your 5th fret your let annoys
that's<00:02:14.630> Johnny<00:02:15.080> be<00:02:15.319> good<00:02:15.550> okay<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.250> basic<00:02:22.850> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
that's Johnny be good okay the basic of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990 
that's Johnny be good okay the basic of
every<00:02:23.600> guitar<00:02:23.990> solo<00:02:24.590> known<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.459> man<00:02:25.670> right

worry about that just as long as it
sounds<00:02:35.810> good<00:02:36.200> oh<00:02:36.350> but<00:02:36.830> try<00:02:37.040> forth<00:02:37.430> throughout

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
sounds good oh but try forth throughout

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:53.730 
sounds good oh but try forth throughout
this<00:02:38.240> scale<00:02:38.600> try<00:02:39.260> barn<00:02:39.530> across<00:02:39.800> other<00:02:40.190> two
