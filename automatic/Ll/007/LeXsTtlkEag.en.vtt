I'll<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.090> putting<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> kuruma<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.590> in

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I'll be putting up that the kuruma is in

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.819 
I'll be putting up that the kuruma is in
fact<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.490> sports<00:01:39.000> car<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:39.600> only<00:01:39.840> leaves<00:01:40.229> some

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
sort of speculation that the sports car

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
sort of speculation that the sports car
and<00:01:43.500> seen<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.579> two<00:01:44.820> versions<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and seen as we do have two versions of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
and seen as we do have two versions of
the<00:01:45.450> kuruma<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.070> armored

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the kuruma has to be this armored

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.649 
the kuruma has to be this armored
vehicle<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.090> putting<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> screen

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.940 
vehicle and putting up on the screen
right<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.619> armored

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
right now now we see this armored

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
right now now we see this armored
vehicle<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.490> different<00:01:51.060> points<00:01:51.420> throughout

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
vehicle at different points throughout

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810

the<00:01:52.110> trailer<00:01:52.470> however<00:01:53.189> by<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.340> looks<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the trailer however by the looks of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
the trailer however by the looks of
things<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.350> ground<00:01:55.740> as

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
things if we go by the same ground as

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.600 
things if we go by the same ground as
the<00:01:56.579> hvy<00:01:57.000> insurgent<00:01:57.780> maybe<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> kuruma<00:01:58.979> could

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the hvy insurgent maybe the kuruma could

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270 
the hvy insurgent maybe the kuruma could
also<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.329> armored<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> non<00:02:01.439> armored<00:02:01.890> seems<00:02:02.130> we

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
also be armored and non armored seems we

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
also be armored and non armored seems we
do<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:03.000> armored<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> trailer<00:02:04.020> and
