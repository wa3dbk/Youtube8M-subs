00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.570 

specialty<00:01:14.880> runs<00:01:15.950> see<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> blade<00:01:17.250> length<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
specialty runs see the blade length is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
specialty runs see the blade length is
almost<00:01:17.790> identical<00:01:18.770> question<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
almost identical question this is just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
almost identical question this is just
under<00:01:20.549> three<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> probably<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.380> in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
under three so this is probably two in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.810 
under three so this is probably two in
yeah<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.090> three<00:01:24.240> quarters<00:01:25.820> handle

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
yeah two and three quarters handle

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.560 
yeah two and three quarters handle
length<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.150> also<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:28.380> similar<00:01:28.710> although<00:01:29.610> in

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
length is also very similar although in

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
length is also very similar although in

it<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> appears<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.140> only<00:01:34.259> 2/3<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it just appears to be only 2/3 of the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.719 
it just appears to be only 2/3 of the
size<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> fact<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.390> almost<00:01:36.630> identical

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729

and that's what you get this knife
I<00:04:42.310> love<00:04:42.819> the<00:04:43.449> spirograph<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.289> my<00:04:44.439> favorite

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
I love the spirograph is my favorite

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.149 
I love the spirograph is my favorite
Damascus<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:46.270> stainless<00:04:46.750> slider

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
Damascus the stainless slider

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.379 
Damascus the stainless slider
stainless<00:04:48.159> spirograph<00:04:48.490> I'm<00:04:48.909> sorry<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.240> like

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
stainless spirograph I'm sorry I like

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.200 
stainless spirograph I'm sorry I like
the<00:04:49.479> smoothness<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.080> stainless<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:51.210> don't

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the smoothness of the stainless I don't

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.580 
the smoothness of the stainless I don't
prefer<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.539> black<00:04:52.659> and<00:04:52.870> white<00:04:52.990> Damascus

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
prefer the black and white Damascus

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.469 
prefer the black and white Damascus
although<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.889> looks<00:04:54.039> nice<00:04:54.360> pattern<00:04:55.360> doesn't

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
although it looks nice pattern doesn't

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.100 
although it looks nice pattern doesn't
show<00:04:55.719> up<00:04:55.779> as<00:04:55.900> good<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.979> I<00:04:57.779> don't<00:04:58.779> like<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
show up as good and I don't like the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.839 
show up as good and I don't like the
rough<00:04:59.289> edge<00:04:59.560> this<00:05:00.279> one<00:05:00.430> doesn't<00:05:00.639> catch<00:05:00.819> the

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
rough edge this one doesn't catch the

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.809 
rough edge this one doesn't catch the
light<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:02.830> doesn't<00:05:03.039> give<00:05:03.279> you<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.400> different

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
light it doesn't give you the different

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.920 
light it doesn't give you the different
looks<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:05.710> ladder<00:05:05.979> does

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
looks that ladder does

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.570 
looks that ladder does
that's<00:05:07.930> why<00:05:08.050> ladder<00:05:08.289> is<00:05:08.439> kinda<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.009> a<00:05:09.099> tie<00:05:09.310> with

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
that's why ladder is kinda in a tie with

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.189 
that's why ladder is kinda in a tie with
the<00:05:09.699> spirograph<00:05:10.180> but<00:05:10.509> I<00:05:10.569> like<00:05:10.689> the<00:05:10.810> pattern<00:05:11.110> on

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
the spirograph but I like the pattern on

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.439 
the spirograph but I like the pattern on
the<00:05:11.289> spirograph<00:05:11.590> better<00:05:11.949> some<00:05:12.909> ladders<00:05:13.270> can

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
the spirograph better some ladders can

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.339 
the spirograph better some ladders can
be<00:05:13.539> really<00:05:13.779> done<00:05:13.930> poorly

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
be really done poorly

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.929 
be really done poorly
pretty<00:05:14.889> much<00:05:14.979> anything<00:05:15.189> done<00:05:15.400> by<00:05:15.490> Devon<00:05:15.759> town

has<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> be<00:05:16.270> great<00:05:16.509> but<00:05:17.349> this<00:05:17.500> little<00:05:17.650> ladder

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
has to be great but this little ladder

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.790 
has to be great but this little ladder
this<00:05:19.060> is<00:05:19.240> top<00:05:19.419> quality<00:05:19.599> it's<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.139> fine<00:05:20.379> knife<00:05:20.620> if

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
this is top quality it's a fine knife if

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.260 
this is top quality it's a fine knife if
you<00:05:20.860> guys<00:05:21.009> can<00:05:21.219> find<00:05:21.490> either<00:05:21.729> one<00:05:21.849> of<00:05:22.029> these
