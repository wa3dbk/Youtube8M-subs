 [Music] 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.349
 already imagined being able to travel in a bed 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.570
 know a bus that has already 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.820
 provide this comfort you like 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.619
 much of travel for example is afraid of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.109
 traveling by plane does not want to travel by car 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 but do not want to give up comfort knowing 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 that there is a bus with bed is this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 even you can travel that way like 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 is that I 'm traditional sitting or 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 also lying here we can 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.739
 recriminating this chair to 180 degrees 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 where you come lying in comfort and you 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.989
 You can sleep all the way to travel quiet 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.329
 the driver paulo dias speaks of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 experience of driving a bus with 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.210
 bed and here it is differentiated 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.640
 what we work more isolated but 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 We have a camera that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.080
 monitor that it brings us visibility 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.909
 from what goes on up there 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 salvador sorrentino explains the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.680
 differences between a conventional bus 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.799
 to fit with bed there is the car 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 and that the chair did not recline and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 180 degrees 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
 the basic difference is that our car 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.420
 called the bed exactly so why 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 be the reclining chair or 180graus for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 give comfort during the journey our 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 customers is a car called l windows 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.229
 where the driver is on the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 first floor exactly the customer has 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.840
 a panoramic view during the trip and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.740
 is a car of 19 seats we offer 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.649
 pillow blanket while traveling 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 bathroom water the regional manager of the useful 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.840
 still says that the ticket price is not 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 very expensive and the space reserved for 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 disabled by the comfort that he 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.579
 offers is practically insignificant in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 difference 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.069
 all cars both conventional and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.810
 executive as a service differentiated by 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.480
 legislation you have to leave two 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.879
 s banks to carriers 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.890
 these special among other people 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.110
 realizes that there is a type of relative who 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.480
 isolate a client and another is to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.030
 than this to give more comfort and 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.849
 privacy while traveling for being a 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.910
 car and on the journey from here to 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.549
 the river has some curves and sometimes the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.280
 person shifts body one side to the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.110
 other then to avoid here and commodity 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.849
 customer that has a side we used 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.260
 this partition exactly to give more 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.260
 privacy while traveling 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:03:13.080
