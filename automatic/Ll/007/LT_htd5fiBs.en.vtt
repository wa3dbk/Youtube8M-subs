00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:13.100 

I<00:00:10.940> think<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> condition<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.450> aspect<00:00:12.929> has

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
I think the condition that aspect has

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.169 
I think the condition that aspect has
been<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.349> big<00:00:13.740> thing<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.130> me<00:00:14.190> being<00:00:14.790> able<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.030> be

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
been a big thing for me being able to be

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
been a big thing for me being able to be
more<00:00:15.360> explosive<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.170> cook<00:00:16.470> her<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.920> feet

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
more explosive and cook her off my feet

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
more explosive and cook her off my feet
also<00:00:18.119> working<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> mid-range<00:00:19.050> jump<00:00:19.380> shot

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.830 
also working on the mid-range jump shot
and<00:00:20.430> probably<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.090> spit<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.660> three

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and probably gonna spit it out to three

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
and probably gonna spit it out to three
at<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.230> point<00:00:22.910> when<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.000> opportunity

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
at some point when that opportunity

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
at some point when that opportunity
presents<00:00:24.840> itself<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.289> other<00:00:25.410> right<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.769> just

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.360 
17 feet no need to stretch it too far
out<00:00:59.600> because<00:01:00.050> that's<00:01:00.260> considered<00:01:00.860> one<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
out because that's considered one of the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.130 
out because that's considered one of the
worst<00:01:01.520> shots<00:01:01.820> in<00:01:01.970> basketball<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.930> long
