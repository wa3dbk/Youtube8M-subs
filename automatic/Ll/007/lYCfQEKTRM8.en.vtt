will<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.940> each<00:02:24.180> other<00:02:24.390> anyway<00:02:24.810> because

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
will have each other anyway because

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.050 
will have each other anyway because
there's<00:02:25.560> no<00:02:25.739> motion<00:02:25.950> conversation<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
there's no motion conversation and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.509 
there's no motion conversation and
that's<00:02:27.239> why<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:28.230> support<00:02:28.590> 24<00:02:29.040> feet<00:02:29.250> from

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
that's why we we support 24 feet from

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's why we we support 24 feet from
your<00:02:29.640> blu-ray<00:02:29.880> tease<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> case<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> 3d

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
your blu-ray tease in the case of 3d

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.910 
your blu-ray tease in the case of 3d
content<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> same<00:02:32.700> still<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:34.380> 3d

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
content to be the same still be a 3d

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620 
content to be the same still be a 3d
image<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.489> still<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.970> some<00:02:36.239> juggler

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
image but you still have some juggler

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.080 
image but you still have some juggler
because<00:02:36.900> that's<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.410> case<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.130> movie<00:02:38.610> content

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
because that's in case of movie content

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140 
because that's in case of movie content
of<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.660> their<00:02:39.900> director<00:02:40.620> intended<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.940> yes

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
of how their director intended it so yes

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970

higher data rate and what about if you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.229 
higher data rate and what about if you

left<00:04:27.570> eye<00:04:27.810> information<00:04:28.620> from<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.010> disc<00:04:29.250> and

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
left eye information from the disc and

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.710 
left eye information from the disc and
that<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.330> turn<00:04:30.599> will<00:04:30.780> give<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.430> image

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
that in turn will give you to the image

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.969 
that in turn will give you to the image
here's<00:04:33.720> an<00:04:33.870> example<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.620> have<00:04:34.800> your

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
here's an example that you have your

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.240 
here's an example that you have your
your<00:04:35.970> 3d<00:04:36.479> blu-ray<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:37.110> your<00:04:37.440> blu-ray<00:04:37.800> player

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
your 3d blu-ray of your blu-ray player

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.570 
your 3d blu-ray of your blu-ray player
then<00:04:39.030> you're<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:40.430> extracting<00:04:41.430> you're

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
then you're just extracting you're

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.040 
then you're just extracting you're
looking<00:04:41.880> at<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.030> left<00:04:42.240> either<00:04:42.450> left<00:04:42.780> on<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
looking at the left either left on the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.570 
looking at the left either left on the
left<00:04:43.169> eye<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.740> course<00:04:43.979> back<00:04:44.220> together

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
left eye and of course back together

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.240 
left eye and of course back together
gives<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.050> image<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.500> then<00:04:46.979> if

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
gives you the to the image and then if

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.360 
gives you the to the image and then if
you<00:04:48.090> upgrade<00:04:48.930> your<00:04:48.960> player<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> 3d<00:04:50.070> player

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
you upgrade your player to a 3d player

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.210 
you upgrade your player to a 3d player
and<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:50.729> course<00:04:50.970> your<00:04:51.180> see<00:04:51.389> whole<00:04:52.289> thing<00:04:53.070> like

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and of course your see whole thing like

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.730 
and of course your see whole thing like
this<00:04:53.370> if<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:54.240> play<00:04:54.419> back<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> 3d<00:04:55.139> disc<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:55.590> your

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
this if you play back a 3d disc on your

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.060 
this if you play back a 3d disc on your
ps3<00:04:56.479> before<00:04:57.479> you've<00:04:57.690> upgraded<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.560> then

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
ps3 before you've upgraded it then

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.670 
ps3 before you've upgraded it then
you're<00:04:59.490> just<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.880> blur<00:05:00.090> left<00:05:00.479> left<00:05:00.720> left<00:05:01.110> once

you're just a blur left left left once

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.409 
you're just a blur left left left once
you've<00:05:01.889> upgraded<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.490> by<00:05:02.639> firmware<00:05:03.180> and

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
you've upgraded it by firmware and

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.900 
you've upgraded it by firmware and

you'll be able to see true 3d contents

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.629 
you'll be able to see true 3d contents
coming<00:05:06.060> off<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.889> another<00:05:07.889> important<00:05:08.430> point

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
coming off the another important point

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.310 
coming off the another important point
is<00:05:08.940> 1.4<00:05:09.870> pass<00:05:10.830> through<00:05:11.310> because<00:05:12.320> imagine

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
is 1.4 pass through because imagine

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.339 
is 1.4 pass through because imagine
you've<00:05:13.530> got<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> 3d<00:05:14.550> player<00:05:14.849> and<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:16.020> want<00:05:16.199> to

about through all your AV systems and

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.490 
about through all your AV systems and
then<00:05:21.240> connect<00:05:21.570> it<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.020> series<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.949> your<00:05:23.070> TV<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
then connect it in series to your TV the

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.050 
then connect it in series to your TV the
problem<00:05:25.830> is<00:05:25.979> that<00:05:26.219> you<00:05:26.340> need<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.700> be<00:05:26.729> able<00:05:26.909> to

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
problem is that you need to be able to

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.360 
problem is that you need to be able to
pass<00:05:27.300> through<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.870> video

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
pass through the video

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.150 
pass through the video
content<00:05:28.850> in<00:05:29.240> 3d<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.050> also<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.680> control

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
content in 3d and also the control

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.750 
content in 3d and also the control
signals<00:05:31.729> from<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.120> players<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.560> TV<00:05:33.770> so

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
signals from the players to the TV so

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.140 
signals from the players to the TV so
this<00:05:34.910> is<00:05:35.060> why<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.780> new<00:05:36.020> audio<00:05:36.860> lineup<00:05:37.280> has<00:05:37.580> so

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
this is why the new audio lineup has so

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.050 
this is why the new audio lineup has so
called<00:05:38.479> 3d<00:05:39.110> pass<00:05:39.440> through<00:05:39.830> reason<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:40.820> if<00:05:41.000> a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
called 3d pass through reason so if a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.430 
called 3d pass through reason so if a
game<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.840> much<00:05:42.199> more<00:05:42.729> intense<00:05:44.440> experience

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
game is much more intense experience

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.080 
game is much more intense experience
because<00:05:45.800> you're<00:05:46.070> obviously<00:05:46.699> it's<00:05:46.880> fast

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
because you're obviously it's fast

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.950 
because you're obviously it's fast
moving<00:05:47.419> your<00:05:48.199> focus<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.770> changing<00:05:49.340> from<00:05:49.960> the

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
moving your focus is changing from the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.870 
moving your focus is changing from the
near<00:05:51.169> view<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:51.830> I<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.979> distance<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.699> back

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
near view so I the distance and back

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.360 
near view so I the distance and back
again<00:05:53.030> and<00:05:53.990> imagine<00:05:54.350> that<00:05:54.530> combined<00:05:55.100> with<00:05:55.310> a

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
again and imagine that combined with a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.240 
again and imagine that combined with a
full-on<00:05:55.820> 5.1<00:05:56.570> or<00:05:56.690> 7.1<00:05:56.720> surround<00:05:57.410> sound<00:05:57.650> system

full-on 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.590 
full-on 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system
it's<00:05:58.550> really<00:05:58.760> going<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:58.910> be<00:05:59.000> quite<00:05:59.180> amazing

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
it's really going to be quite amazing

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:12.710 
it's really going to be quite amazing
picture<00:05:59.930> quality

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.720 

I<00:06:13.250> should<00:06:14.250> say<00:06:14.400> here<00:06:14.610> we've<00:06:14.790> got<00:06:14.820> a<00:06:16.730> prototype
