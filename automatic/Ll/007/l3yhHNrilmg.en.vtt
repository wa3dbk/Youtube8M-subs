00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.280
 me 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.280
 Minutes 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 I will explain the manual this time 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.620
 Please take a look at this large r first 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.360
 I 'm Shutter Eson Chan and 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.850
 There is m 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:32.470
 It this is the one to say when the control Roh's likely exposure represents what 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.280
 I use av or when I do aperture priority 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:42.460
 And when you give priority to the shutter, you use tv 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 And when it is far in the manual, it is supposed to use m 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.100
 I 'm talking about four words 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.039
 Professional or 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:00.309
 Hayama tea Well, also I liked the wind to say that use it is without response manual 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:04.960
 In a sense that it's correct I mean it's wrong I mean this 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.580
 Manual in some cases, rather than that it must necessarily use 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.070
 It is that I use the manual 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.460
 Therefore usually use aperture priority 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.140
 this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.890
 For example Why For either use the aperture priority also I think that can be seen if you look at the other videos 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.190
 But 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.490
 Great qualifying this time 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.620
 I will explain the difference between the body goodness manual 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 Now correction in the first aperture and the priority aperture priority is Kedomo has become zero 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.259
 You next mast 1/8 and the aperture to 4 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.690
 Will change the shutter speed by changing the aperture from the aperture is the preferred 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:46.070
 For example, if it is 5.6, it will be changed to 1/4 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.909
 If it is 8 and it changes to 1/2 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.340
 That means it's about 5 flights and 1 minute 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:58.190
 And if you go to 10% of the house it will change to one second 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.770
 Let's take a look at star say now's the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:07.790
 If you give priority to the shutter, how many do you think will be 1/4 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.330
 Well it means that it will be 5.6 of the same number 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.310
 Accordingly, as in the earlier it is here 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.989
 If it is one second 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 Speaking of some to happens is that the same so as to be in the 11 and earlier 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:28.440
 The difference between aperture priority and shutter superiority is that shutter speed changes when aperture is prioritized 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.959
 Shutter priority will make the shutter superior, so if you decide on the shutter 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 It means that the aperture changes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.760
 Let's take a look at the manual What is the manual 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.640
 It is the case of the manual now has come out completely different numbers 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.980
 Please try it now 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.700
 This one is almost +1 now 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.600
 Boke this first to plus or minus zero as before 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.800
 I will 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.180
 If you change the other specific to the shutter speed at the Yoroshi -0 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.250
 When it comes to a path of plus or minus zero 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.710
 It looks like a 0.3 seconds, 6.3 and never seen numbers 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.520
 This is the aperture 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:17.430
 It is because the edge chooses things until now 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.430
 First select the 11 and earlier is I match this I was one ward in one second part 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.750
 In 11 you are stuck in a place called plus or minus zero in strength etc. 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 I think I do not understand 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:39.390
 When you decide the shutter speed by setting the aperture. 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 If you use manual and take it at plus or minus zero, it is more accurate 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.970
 Some people say that 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.980
 But this is the same thing with shutter priority or aperture priority 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.760
 The numerical shutter priority that can be made with the aperture priority given to the aperture is referred to as one kind 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.770
 It will be 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.460
 However, in the case of Maria, there are other uses. 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:05.150
 In these cases where the light conditions change very complicatedly , 2 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.870
 Exposure does not stabilize easily when migrating 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:14.480
 As an image of a photograph It is when it is more than it. 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:18.440
 I use the manual, I think that the numbers coming out to the end are the same 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.270
 How is it like a manual? 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:28.490
 There are many parts received with a certain misunderstanding 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.850
 It means that unless not cleanly take out the manual is not the case of the photo large east 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.520
 Even if you use it, it can not be taken sufficiently beautiful I 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.630
 It is a fact that there is also a situation where you have to use a manual 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:45.140
 How to use this manual 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.140
 I would like to explain to you at another opportunity.
