Janowski as opposed to nolans I feel

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
Janowski as opposed to nolans I feel
like<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.230> put<00:00:31.470> enough<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
like they just don't put enough into the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.610 
like they just don't put enough into the
newgen<00:00:32.820> house<00:00:32.940> keys<00:00:33.180> anymore<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.200> looks

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
newgen house keys anymore it just looks

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
newgen house keys anymore it just looks
like<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.100> random<00:00:35.520> ass<00:00:35.640> colors<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> whole

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
like just random ass colors and a whole

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.380 
like just random ass colors and a whole
bunch<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.380> colors<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.760> kind<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> boring

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
for me and and I think they should

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
for me and and I think they should
definitely<00:00:42.899> put<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.140> more<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.010> but

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
definitely put some more into them but

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.040 
definitely put some more into them but
