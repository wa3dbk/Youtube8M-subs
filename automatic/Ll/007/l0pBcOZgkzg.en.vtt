LG's<00:00:14.099> suction<00:00:14.700> power<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.269> strong<00:00:15.809> and

LG's suction power is strong and

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.070 
LG's suction power is strong and
sustained<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.060> compressor<00:00:18.510> system

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
sustained because the compressor system

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.179 
sustained because the compressor system
separates<00:00:19.619> dust<00:00:20.070> intake<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> airflow<00:00:21.600> the

technology enables more dust intake that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.139 
technology enables more dust intake that
is<00:00:30.630> why<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.009> compressor<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.489> clean<00:00:32.880> longer

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
is why the compressor can clean longer
