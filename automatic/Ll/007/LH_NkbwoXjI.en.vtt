 Overall, he builds a romantic 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 relationship with a character in the game 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.870
 which does not always correspond to the norm 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.719
 Here are five bizarre dates in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.509
 player from where probably japan in place 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 Number 50 is actually exist 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 dating in player from still images and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.689
 a lot of text well it is complete 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 animated and that from the year 2005 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.099
 originating game is mainly because of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.099
 one known because of his bed endings 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.040
 in cruel scenes, every date ends in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.469
 Homicide and suicide attempts china 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 plays the students itu makoto the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 secretly on the way to school 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 Mobile Photo of his adored power 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.210
 be his classmate and how to find 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 the picture on markus handy and decides 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 bring the two together 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.329
 but they were developed after and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 after self-esteem for makoto and now 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.780
 do you think the lucky one has 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 two girls at the start 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 but as soon as one of the other 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 wind gets it pretty brave 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 actually, it always ends in the blood 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.350
 no matter which of the two is adjusted who 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.119
 So on fluffy fluffy end is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 he should avoid school days 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.760
 feels more like one too 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.229
 interactive anni more than like one 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.030
 typical dates in the game also goes 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.540
 more in the hands direction the story is 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 but good 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 Only marco will start sometime 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 hate because he is such a dumbass 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.970
 and anything but a nice boy 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.720
 but each of his dates ends for that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.720
 in a blood bath 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.900
 kohei took the fourth place among them 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 would know me here now the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.420
 Masterchief pass by and me always 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.150
 ask for a date 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.620
 I would not say no and just now 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.690
 video game characters respectively 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.060
 comic characters to think that there is 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.750
 also in the dates in the genre and indeed at 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.400
 namco hi 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.710
 in lankow ii played the character 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.480
 cash registers originating from the katamari series 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.840
 and the cousin of the main character prince 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.850
 is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.490
 after having cash in the school 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
 a catamaran has played around 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.210
 and the ensuing chaos ensued 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 there is the little kasselmann 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.300
 detention again 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 And that's exactly where everyone learned 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 Know potential dates from spaceship 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 even to the popular drum donko 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 can you with the most diverse 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.259
 Figures interact from the comic 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.470
 universe of namco bandai 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 US subsidiary ship the look came 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.770
 namco maybe it's not that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 most romantic dates in the game for that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.130
 but really unbelievably funny and it 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.200
 somehow we feel like we have one 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.030
 art digital breakfast club version and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.739
 who knows the movie breakfast happy 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 must see 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.250
 Bernd knows what I'm talking about 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.190
 Julius and Nico do not know that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.070
 so now look at a classic 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.459
 hose a beauty not a muscleman 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.570
 a freak and a freaky that is 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.489
 but I can not believe that I am here 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.560
 had to come before this day to end 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.170
 you will violate all rules 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.209
 i can only recommend namco hey to you 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.370
 lay there are sometimes so bizarre 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.440
 conversations and stories 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.690
 which I really had to laugh out loud 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.390
 and that's exactly what not every one can do 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.549
 game on place number three has though 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.410
 wolf if I must confess I am 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.900
 really not the biggest deaf fan 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.410
 because my whole balcony is fuller 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.780
 Deaf but at the datings ins are the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.940
 Deaf somehow a hot number 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 that sounds so wrong 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.220
 there is one in hartford wolf pack 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.470
 school no sorry the best school for 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.960
 gifted doves in the really 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.850
 our whole life takes place and 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.100
 Surprise we are the only person 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.500
 the saint peter nations institute 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.480
 visited in contrast to the manga style 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.940
 In the background are the pictures 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.470
 the deaf real photos at the beginning 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.480
 already a little irritating 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.130
 So you learn different pigeons 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.580
 know throughout history and all over 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.530
 Honestly 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.570
 after a while you forget that it is 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.220
 for deaf trading and geest simply more 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.960
 on the traits one and the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.000
 story is so good she brings you 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.800
 really often to laugh to empathize 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.270
 and hey , honestly, would be any 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.530
 Corncob city pigeons in it 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.840
 then i would like the story as well 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.850
 good or find a kitchen roll or 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.580
 something and on number 2 doris 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.830

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.750
 he has a terex right he has a tip 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.410
 ex with so small cute short arms 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.180
 and fluffy fangs interest 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.100
 map you meet the uncertain the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 notary and go with the reptile one 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.919
 Buy ukulele 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.959
 depending on what you ask for the date 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.280
 and how often yours react 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.450
 the date runs well or ends abruptly 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.490
 I do not come from these somehow 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.780
 thoughts away how abstruse and curious 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.730
 partly these dates in the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.010
 Constellations are at the same time 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.680
 but really really entertaining 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.240
 and funny what the japanese concerns the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.340
 are doing certain dating 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 Constellations also pretty 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.930
 painless so in games 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.449
 and place number one coco loco if 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.009
 we are already in animals then stay 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.300
 We'll be right there and take a look 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.639
 play closer and that coco loco in 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.250
 the visual novel with the so stimulating 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.380
 title full in love with insects it should 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.720
 you agree with the jerseys 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.270
 Have a bat as a grasshopper 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.470
 young sister and a real demon 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.690
 looking buddy 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.880
 So who run a sweet grashÃ¼pfer 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.669
 a school uniform in a bathing suit 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.100
 and in a pink panties in the bathroom 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.070
 wants to see who is exactly right here 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.110
 So after insects drum spaceships 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.789
 I have dinosaurs and doves for you 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.160
 Now I believe the most bizarre dating 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.350
 games are shown as there are but me 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.419
 bet one of you is one 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.699
 or other expert in the 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.800
 area is very familiar and it would be too 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.120
 totally cool if you're just in there 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.729
 If you still can write comments 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.220
 more abstract dates the game knows 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.500
 even though I'm not sure if I am 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.490
 I really want to know that 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.490
 so pure
