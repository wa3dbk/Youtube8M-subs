00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.419
 from the more likely who could propagate something like that 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.309
 That should be before marriage or syrup 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 gg we are preparing very much 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.130
 around ten percent increase 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.759
 temporarily the sectors 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.060
 Could be the day before 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.599
 Web portal 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 first you have to bois 2 2 third was to be careful even 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.470
 So there they are the two new press that also from Borussia Fulda 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.740
 Marzio reason to keep their word they are both 18 years old compact from all 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.220
 Pip crew supervise Porto Alegre and have your home here 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.220
 played the highest junior league 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.490
 both are excellent technicians Jegor a striker Marzio 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.940
 Midfielder and they are in recent months Borussia Fulda in the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.440
 Kerpener back to the top chances the two Brazilians themselves we hope 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.580
 in Germany on a bright future hoping for a contract in the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 Bundesliga or in the second league 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.610
 The two were mediated by the agency Pace despite and we have with 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.459
 Peter Vogler who belongs to the Pittsburgh Steelers 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.549
 immediately became second again 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.610
 Meadow the two players came here at all 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.300
 What can one expect from the two? 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.880
 I both players are percent 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 18 years 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 and from the south of Brazil 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.920
 then the players picked 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.150
 because in the south of Brazil it is the temperature from the climate it is very 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.730
 very similar percent of Germany 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.799
 and that's why we chose that and we believe that 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.879
 a from the capacity of the capacity of the players 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.799
 that the urn where could remain in the second league can play in the next 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.940
 two or three years 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.339
 how they ever came here for complaints 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.899
 So percent we have an agency a sports agency in here 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.680
 Bad Hersfeld 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.209
 the company is called percent export 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.510
 Those are percent of clean ones and I know they are responsible 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.849
 and percent the agency in brazil it's called the spin that's five 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.759
 star 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.369
 Percent in the German football wanted absolutely wanted 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.289
 What do in Germany and thus is the partnership with sensual 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.900
 stood 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.429
 between Borussia Fulda and the customer's processes 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.169
 and percent of VP Sports has it all organized and me 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.709
 believe the players will bring what once awoke OM Rose Hola 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.589
 why Borussia Fulda I think we chose because of the 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.519
 Structure forth 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.019
 the TuS in the region no second case 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.379
 So I think that should be such a stadium with 18 thousand spectators 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.209
 because not censorship of the six training official 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.089
 Training places and so on I think of the structure has given us percent 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.089
 so impressed filler and the final where they used to be 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.639
 but a short-term we want to keep waiting 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.809
 Neuberger also gets used to this year, of course, that's pretty clear 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.759
 you will never forget that the players of course yes from the 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.130
 completely different culture come 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.819
 that the language can not 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.099
 and Zurich was already the flashing we want to hope that they are more like that again 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.500
 they have to shoot the 15 goals so that's close already 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.429
 of course that raises 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.429
 Percent noise a striker and we have an attacking midfielder 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:45.690
 how fast you have to 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.230
 In the two German percentages are provided Vitus should ask themselves 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.749
 the acclimatization 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.579
 So the players are the ones 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.259
 yes and as soon as possible will be very crucial to visit shortly that 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.179
 Magath am organizing 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.009
 because that is fundamental that they can speak the language 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.709
 And then you have to see everything so that's obviously the two of them playing 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.659
 Players are very young so at the age of 18 you learn relatively quickly 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:08.559
 I think to myself 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.199
 and I think they'll be safe within a few months or click 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.129
 acclimatized 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.329
 mix well 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.169
 only a few days are like here in Fulda 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.849
 and they already have the first training sessions behind them and the 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:29.149
 Prices are already looking forward to their first missions in the jersey of roses 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.379
 I'm glad 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.159
 Pattern in front
