00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.699 
first very put out of my adult lashes
but<00:02:06.140> I'm<00:02:06.229> using<00:02:06.410> them<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.820> look<00:02:08.060> because

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
but I'm using them for this look because

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:19.930 
but I'm using them for this look because
I<00:02:10.240> want<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.510> show<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.110> variety

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.180 

and<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.780> don't<00:02:20.990> know<00:02:21.080> about<00:02:21.170> lashes<00:02:21.650> no

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
and if you don't know about lashes no

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.290 
and if you don't know about lashes no
matter<00:02:22.370> whether<00:02:22.550> you're<00:02:22.730> laying<00:02:22.910> them<00:02:23.030> or<00:02:23.150> not

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
matter whether you're laying them or not

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.030 
matter whether you're laying them or not
you<00:02:23.360> want<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.200> short<00:02:24.710> side<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:27.530> be<00:02:27.620> close<00:02:27.830> to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
you want the short side to be close to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.170 
you want the short side to be close to
your<00:02:28.160> nose<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.910> long<00:02:29.120> side<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.810> be<00:02:29.930> out

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
your nose and the long side to be out

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.070 
your nose and the long side to be out
otherwise<00:02:32.180> all<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.510> queer<00:02:32.720> it'll<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:32.960> like

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
otherwise all the queer it'll be like

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.460 
otherwise all the queer it'll be like
longer<00:02:33.410> than<00:02:33.560> short<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.930> then<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.230> put

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
longer than short so then you just put

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.940 
longer than short so then you just put
this<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.800> top<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.310> other<00:02:37.490> one

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.550 

and<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.640> reason<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.030> look<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.930> works<00:02:48.230> so

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
and the reason this look this works so

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.320 
and the reason this look this works so
effectively<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.280> because<00:02:49.610> there's<00:02:49.880> no<00:02:50.090> way

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
effectively is because there's no way

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.130 
effectively is because there's no way
you're<00:02:50.540> going<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> get<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> perfect<00:02:52.120> meaning

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
you're going to get it perfect meaning

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.479 
you're going to get it perfect meaning
they're<00:02:54.140> not<00:02:54.349> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.680> pancake<00:02:54.950> they're

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
they're not going to be pancake they're

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.089 
they're not going to be pancake they're
gonna<00:02:55.640> be<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.230> there's<00:02:57.230> gonna<00:02:57.349> be<00:02:57.530> air<00:02:57.770> between

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
gonna be a there's gonna be air between

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.620 
gonna be a there's gonna be air between
them<00:02:58.400> they're<00:02:59.060> gonna<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.360> little<00:02:59.540> bit

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
them they're gonna be a little bit

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.790 
them they're gonna be a little bit
separated<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:03.290> gonna<00:03:03.500> make<00:03:03.620> them

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
separated and that is gonna make them

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:29.290 
separated and that is gonna make them
appear<00:03:04.040> much<00:03:04.310> thicker

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.340 

Moishe<00:03:30.300> shape<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.080> did<00:03:31.200> the

while<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.600> glue<00:03:42.750> dries<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.410> use<00:03:44.040> bonding<00:03:44.490> glue

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
while the glue dries I use bonding glue

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.420 
while the glue dries I use bonding glue
I<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.970> don't<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:48.950> I'm<00:03:49.950> not<00:03:50.160> telling

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
you the idea but I like it because the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.270 
you the idea but I like it because the
glue<00:03:54.090> dries<00:03:54.360> very<00:03:54.480> quickly<00:03:54.740> on<00:03:55.740> your<00:03:55.800> lashes

actually<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:11.190> could<00:04:11.370> be<00:04:11.490> missed<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.730> minute<00:04:11.940> -

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
actually this could be missed a minute -

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.840

and<00:04:49.620> then<00:04:49.740> again<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:51.000> other<00:04:51.180> half<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.689> an<00:04:51.810> old

but<00:04:56.340> again<00:04:56.729> I'm<00:04:56.939> just<00:04:57.060> using<00:04:57.270> them<00:04:57.479> for<00:04:57.509> effect

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
but again I'm just using them for effect

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.749

and<00:04:58.319> dimension<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:59.039> recession<00:04:59.340> I

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
and dimension and it's a recession I

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.730 
and dimension and it's a recession I
think<00:04:59.939> you<00:05:00.210> should<00:05:00.389> reuse<00:05:00.719> your<00:05:00.840> lashes<00:05:01.469> many
