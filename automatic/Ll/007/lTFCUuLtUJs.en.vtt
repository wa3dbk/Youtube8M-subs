00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
moving basically you just twist the BOA

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.300 
moving basically you just twist the BOA
system<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.540> back<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.959> tighten<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
system in the back to tighten it or you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.030 
system in the back to tighten it or you
pull<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.569> loosen<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.860> how

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
pull it out to loosen it and that's how

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.199 

choice<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.489> put<00:02:33.579> where<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.909> important
