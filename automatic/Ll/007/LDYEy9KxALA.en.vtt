with your dotting tool right near the
nail<00:01:26.200> bed<00:01:26.409> next<00:01:26.860> you're<00:01:27.220> just<00:01:27.250> gonna<00:01:27.610> make<00:01:27.880> a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
nail bed next you're just gonna make a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.660 
nail bed next you're just gonna make a
thick<00:01:28.450> white<00:01:28.810> stripe<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.979> started<00:01:30.399> by

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
thick white stripe and I started by

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.430 
thick white stripe and I started by
using<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.179> nail<00:01:31.360> stripers<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:31.990> then<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.170> found

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
using the nail stripers but then I found

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.469 
using the nail stripers but then I found
that<00:01:32.649> using<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.550> regular<00:01:33.729> nail<00:01:34.030> polish

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
that using just the regular nail polish

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.480 
that using just the regular nail polish
brush<00:01:34.869> was<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.110> lot<00:01:35.319> easier<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.979> below<00:01:36.280> that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
brush was a lot easier and below that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.370 
brush was a lot easier and below that
you're<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.880> going<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.149> start<00:01:37.479> making<00:01:37.720> two

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
you're just going to start making two

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.370 
you're just going to start making two
more<00:01:38.770> lines<00:01:39.130> with<00:01:39.759> your<00:01:39.970> white<00:01:40.210> striper<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
more lines with your white striper the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.430 
more lines with your white striper the
way<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.970> between<00:01:43.240> those<00:01:43.509> two<00:01:43.750> lines<00:01:43.929> start<00:01:44.380> to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
way now between those two lines start to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.529 
way now between those two lines start to
make<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.920> zigzag<00:01:45.490> pattern<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:46.239> it<00:01:46.360> definitely

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
make a zigzag pattern and it definitely

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.419 
make a zigzag pattern and it definitely
does<00:01:46.929> not<00:01:46.959> have<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.470> be<00:01:47.590> perfect<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.190> then

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
does not have to be perfect and then

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.490 
does not have to be perfect and then
below<00:01:48.849> this<00:01:49.030> exact<00:01:49.539> pattern<00:01:49.750> you're<00:01:50.110> going<00:01:50.349> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
below this exact pattern you're going to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.650 
below this exact pattern you're going to
make<00:01:50.649> another<00:01:50.800> row<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.489> dots<00:01:51.670> just<00:01:52.300> like<00:01:52.420> we

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
make another row of dots just like we

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.680

with some little tiny hearts and you can
do<00:01:59.379> this<00:01:59.530> by<00:01:59.709> making<00:01:59.890> little<00:02:00.369> diagonal<00:02:00.729> lines

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
do this by making little diagonal lines

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.210
