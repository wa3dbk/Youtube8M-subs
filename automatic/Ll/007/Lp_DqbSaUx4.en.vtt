00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the people outside little I hope that it 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.890
 find very well since in this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.839
 occasion we are going to talk about a great 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.429
 Disney production is about the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.429
 tomorrowland ribbon 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.000
 this movie is starring 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.160
 graphs and george clooney and brad roberts 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.960
 are mainly and behind this 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.239
 movie we really have a great 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 hungry director warn himself in charge of 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.980
 make movies like the incredible 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.680
 giant iron ratatouille or mission 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.329
 impossible 4 and what is this movie about 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 Well first of all if you have 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.050
 had the opportunity to go to some 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.560
 disney theme park know that there 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.360
 an area called motorland and maybe 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.780
 have heard of this area is a 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.030
 section of disney park which 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.220
 it is taken to make this new 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 movie just as it happened with the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420
 pirate tape of the Caribbean that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.040
 inspired in the Disney game was not 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.110
 first movie and then the game but 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.079
 that first the game was the area 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.060
 thematic and then the movie was the 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.090
 what good as its name says humor 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.100
 hollande is from a city of tomorrow a 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.560
 futuristic space where we will have 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.000
 the story of this girl who comes across 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.210
 with an object just like 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
 this one small pine a kind of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 coin that when touched is transported to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.270
 future has this vision of the future is 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.040
 place in that place really 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.170
 spectacular and good from it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.290
 they're going to start doing different things 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 who are going to present this new story 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.650
 I do not tell you more because always 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.600
 anything that I can tell you is 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.880
 could ruin them or be spoilers for 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.010
 which I better stay in that base and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.500
 I think it's no good to ruin anything 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.509
 so we have that basically and the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.330
 truth is that when watching this movie I 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.580
 compare with the splash mountain game 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.040
 that is also a Disney game in the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.960
 which basically what you most want 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.729
 to do is get on this little trick that goes 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.380
 over the water to fall because you see how 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.810
 people are falling and have fun in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.209
 the fall of deltron I remove that all happy 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.550
 but really to get to the fall 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.200
 you take a long time going through 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.290
 like a story and there are dolls that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.090
 they sing and they tell you various things and 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 this movie seemed to me like that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.670
 one goes with the intention of seeing one thing 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.000
 It really takes a long time to start 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.880
 however the journey and so 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.010
 we are going through it is very beautiful very 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.569
 entertaining and beyond what I 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.790
 I really expected this movie 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.160
 because because from the beginning to address the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 future in a very interesting way 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.910
 obviously thinking about your motorland us 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.060
 we went to the idea that it would be 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.790
 more in the style of tron ​​elysium or maybe 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.350
 avatar where we have this environment 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 futuristic where we want to see how 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.940
 the transport technology works 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.349
 how people behave and of course 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.420
 we will have a little of this but that 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.100
 it's not going to be the main reason for the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.019
 history made way the truth is 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.590
 that the movie has many references 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.840
 Historical cultural geeks that do not 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.790
 they are just fun to watch but 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.330
 that bring that special touch to you 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.500
 the movie that does not happen like 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.060
 unnoticed or if there are things that you 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.069
 You can like how you're going to fit 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.170
 recorded and I feel that these details 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.750
 them in a very special tape because 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.459
 has a story that not only goes to 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.650
 entertain or you will be cute but that 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.109
 has many references and complements 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.150
 very well what is happening and inside 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.489
 I love that it's so organic 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.400
 in a very good way and it's also a 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.620
 very funny movie but do not feel 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.629
 forced the jokes are very natural and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.400
 in general I feel that the characters are 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.840
 very natural and within it for 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.299
 Of course I can not stop mentioning that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.760
 the performances are and you will be entirely 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.700
 very good performances of all but in 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.879
 The girl's special understanding was that 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.370
 girl is phenomenal surely 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.780
 will become very famous after this movie 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.430
 and also some years past because 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280
 apart is a very pretty girl is a 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.319
 excellent actress apart from the mentioned thing 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.420
 something that I loved about the movie is 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.730
 which addresses the theme of travel in the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.889
 time and not just one way 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.959
 very quiet very disney-like but 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.819
 something that demands a little more from you 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.310
 knowledge or that poses you theories 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.560
 very interesting something like what 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.859
 it happens in interstellar but in my opinion 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.930
 and many things I do not like about this but 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.880
 with more history behind a story 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.130
 more interesting than it really shows 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.169
 that brad see if the director made a 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.940
 strong research regarding the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.039
 relativity the theories of 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.030
 spacetime and good to see many 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.730
 things that work 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.370
 very well in this movie and finally 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.950
 in the end leaves a reflection not only 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.290
 very cute but very impressive is of 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.720
 these movies that leave you thinking 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.180
 that I think many people who see 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.370
 they will leave a good message they will 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.140
 create an awareness and I feel also 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.760
 which is this kind of movies that 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.480
 we saw children like indiana jones or 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.470
 star wars that caused such an impact 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.510
 cinematographic in us that is to say 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.160
 want to make movies to feel like 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.620
 this emotion different from what we had 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.450
 been used for which I think 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.580
 that at the same time a lot this movie is 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.990
 excellent and despite everything seems 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.420
 very perfect the truth is that one of the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.790
 things that I find strange more than 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.850
 bad this movie is that obviously its 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.830
 audience pretends to be childish that the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.690
 children are going to see this tape however 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.990
 I believe that children or people 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.760
 small can be quite 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.640
 boring as three quarters 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.140
 of the movie there is not so much clear action 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.670
 that there is action of course there is but 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.260
 I do not think the kind of action that a 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.180
 child may seem like very 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.580
 entertaining or very funny or very 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.270
 fun but I think it works 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.340
 soon more 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.320
 the adults apart from that I think they are 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.770
 some more violent films that I've 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.210
 seen from Disney I say obviously we have 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.570
 avengers' but I mean movies 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.670
 like the disney 100% disney seems like a 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.680
 little violence the truth and out of it 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.840
 it's things like they're not so 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.000
 logical inside obviously own 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.180
 universe of the movie or soon to be 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.140
 it falls a little increases but it recovers 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.840
 but outside of it the truth is that I 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.580
 it seems an excellent movie better than 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.800
 what I expected the truth that is worth all 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.310
 it's worth going to see the cinema and I that's why I 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.930
 I give four stars and a half tenth 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.510
 you already dare that such contempt and 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.460
