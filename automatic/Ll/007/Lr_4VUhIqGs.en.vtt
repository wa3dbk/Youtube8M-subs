with even more involved in the game and
it<00:00:37.620> becomes<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.160> fairly<00:00:38.790> complex<00:00:39.149> game<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it becomes a fairly complex game but I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.639 
it becomes a fairly complex game but I
had<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.219> qualms<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.719> game<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
had some qualms with the game the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
had some qualms with the game the
biggest<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> fact<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
biggest one basically was the fact that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
biggest one basically was the fact that
the<00:00:45.690> cards<00:00:46.020> were<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.280> difficult<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the cards were very very difficult to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
the cards were very very difficult to
read<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.930> could<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.320> tell<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
read and you could not tell the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
read and you could not tell the
different<00:00:50.039> armies<00:00:50.340> apart<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.719> well

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
different armies apart really very well

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.569 
different armies apart really very well
because<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> backgrounds<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because the backgrounds all look the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.180 
because the backgrounds all look the
same<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.090> pictures<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.559> artwork<00:00:55.980> was

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
same the pictures well the artwork was

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
same the pictures well the artwork was
not<00:00:56.399> bad<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
not bad it was just a very you know I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
not bad it was just a very you know I
want<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> game<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
guess and there's going to be a few

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
guess and there's going to be a few
problems<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.860> review<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.369> first<00:01:38.850> problem

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
problems in this review my first problem

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
problems in this review my first problem
is<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> fact<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.250> still<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.970> how

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is the fact that I still don't see how

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090 
is the fact that I still don't see how
the<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.110> army<00:01:43.500> has<00:01:43.710> much<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> chance

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the one army has much of a chance

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
the one army has much of a chance
against<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.850> army<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
against the other army when all is that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
against the other army when all is that
have<00:01:45.899> done<00:01:46.110> adding<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> cavalry<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> thought

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
have done adding the cavalry I thought

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.340 
have done adding the cavalry I thought
maybe<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.479> give<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.960> army

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
maybe they would give the one army

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
maybe they would give the one army
little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.619> faster<00:01:50.040> Calvary<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.939> just

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little bit faster Calvary and it just

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
little bit faster Calvary and it just
doesn't<00:01:51.420> work<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.530> army

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
doesn't work out very well the one army

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
doesn't work out very well the one army
is<00:01:52.860> still<00:01:53.070> certainly<00:01:53.759> stronger<00:01:54.060> than<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
is still certainly stronger than the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.130 
is still certainly stronger than the
other<00:01:54.509> however<00:01:55.310> what<00:01:56.310> else<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> game<00:01:56.909> at

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
other however what else is the game at

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.100 
other however what else is the game at
let's<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.750> will<00:02:00.750> say<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
let's take a look at it I will say that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
let's take a look at it I will say that
they<00:02:01.229> did<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.680> better<00:02:02.009> design<00:02:02.790> job<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
they did a better design job on the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.730 
they did a better design job on the
cards<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> car<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> you're

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
cards this is the car that you're

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
cards this is the car that you're
looking<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.909> card<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
looking at here is a card from the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.969 
looking at here is a card from the
initial<00:02:06.689> set<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> here's<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> card<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
initial set and here's a card from the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
initial set and here's a card from the
new<00:02:08.250> set<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.450> numbers

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
new set and you can see that the numbers

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.860 
new set and you can see that the numbers
are<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:10.920> crisper<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> new<00:02:12.030> card<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
are much crisper on the new card the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.080 
are much crisper on the new card the
artwork<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.680> easier<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.489> it's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
artwork is a lot easier to see it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.580 
artwork is a lot easier to see it's
still<00:02:15.360> difficult<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.870> tell<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> two<00:02:16.260> RVs

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
still difficult to tell the two RVs

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
still difficult to tell the two RVs
apart<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.129> still<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.700> easy<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:18.000> mean

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
apart it's still not that easy I mean

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.970 
apart it's still not that easy I mean
there's<00:02:18.450> still<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.780> ton<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.200> information<00:02:19.620> on

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
there's still a ton of information on

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
there's still a ton of information on
these<00:02:20.069> cards<00:02:20.430> looking<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.239> all<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> numbers

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
these cards looking for all the numbers

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.839 
these cards looking for all the numbers
but<00:02:22.020> hey<00:02:22.590> I'll<00:02:22.800> take<00:02:22.980> whatever<00:02:23.220> advantage<00:02:23.819> i

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
but hey I'll take whatever advantage i

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.350 
but hey I'll take whatever advantage i
can<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.510> another<00:02:25.140> thing<00:02:25.379> at<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> game<00:02:25.770> ads<00:02:26.040> as

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
can get another thing at the game ads as

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.479 
can get another thing at the game ads as
secondary<00:02:27.360> terrain<00:02:28.129> basically<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.310> add

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
secondary terrain basically you add

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.280 
secondary terrain basically you add
another<00:02:29.940> piece<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.360> train<00:02:30.569> for<00:02:30.780> example<00:02:31.110> here

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
another piece of train for example here

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680 
another piece of train for example here
we<00:02:31.379> have<00:02:31.410> marsh<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.940> add<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> gully

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
we have marsh and then I can add a gully

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.970 
we have marsh and then I can add a gully
to<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.230> again<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
to it and again you can see the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
to it and again you can see the
difference<00:02:35.280> between<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.640> cards<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.959> can

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
difference between the cards but I can

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.809 
difference between the cards but I can
add<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.379> gully<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.160> terrain<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.700> it's

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
add a gully to that terrain and it's

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.580 
add a gully to that terrain and it's
actually<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.510> an<00:02:39.690> excerpt<00:02:40.170> piece<00:02:40.410> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
actually like an excerpt piece of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250 
actually like an excerpt piece of
terrain<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.330> gully<00:02:42.599> only<00:02:43.019> takes

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
terrain and so that gully only takes

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.869 
terrain and so that gully only takes
place<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.769> part<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> terrain<00:02:44.550> card

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
place on part of the terrain card

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.809 
place on part of the terrain card
alright<00:02:45.780> well<00:02:46.019> that's<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.470> more<00:02:46.860> terrain<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
alright well that's as more terrain to

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.570 
alright well that's as more terrain to
the<00:02:48.090> game<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:49.050> game<00:02:49.170> also<00:02:49.440> adds<00:02:49.920> several

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the game the game also adds several

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.729 
the game the game also adds several
different<00:02:52.099> cards<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:54.000> basically<00:02:54.739> cards

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
different cards that are basically cards

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.070 
different cards that are basically cards

I liked it a lot I play through the
original<00:04:21.720> scenario

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
was fun my problem with the game was the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.660 
was fun my problem with the game was the
design<00:04:37.810> which<00:04:38.290> has<00:04:38.620> improved<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:39.520> not

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
design which has improved but not

design which has improved but not
improved<00:04:40.090> enough<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.660> it's<00:04:41.290> still<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.590> very

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
improved enough that it's still a very

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.740 
improved enough that it's still a very
difficult<00:04:42.370> game<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:42.940> figure<00:04:43.390> out<00:04:43.540> what's

same<00:06:43.139> I<00:06:43.729> mean<00:06:44.729> I<00:06:44.789> suppose<00:06:45.119> like<00:06:45.240> I<00:06:45.270> put<00:06:45.419> all<00:06:45.599> the

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:45.899 
same I mean I suppose like I put all the

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:47.480 
same I mean I suppose like I put all the
different<00:06:46.199> cards<00:06:46.469> in<00:06:46.559> all<00:06:46.770> different<00:06:47.009> plastic

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
different cards in all different plastic

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.339 
different cards in all different plastic
bags<00:06:47.699> and<00:06:47.939> mark<00:06:48.389> those<00:06:48.539> plastic<00:06:48.960> bags<00:06:49.139> with

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
bags and mark those plastic bags with

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:51.049 
bags and mark those plastic bags with
labels<00:06:49.770> so<00:06:50.309> I<00:06:50.369> can<00:06:50.520> figure<00:06:50.669> out<00:06:50.789> what<00:06:50.939> they

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:51.059 
labels so I can figure out what they

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.879 
labels so I can figure out what they
were<00:06:51.119> but<00:06:51.479> it's<00:06:51.689> a<00:06:51.990> card<00:06:52.289> game<00:06:52.349> it<00:06:52.589> should<00:06:52.649> be<00:06:52.860> a

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
were but it's a card game it should be a

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.980 
were but it's a card game it should be a
lot<00:06:53.069> easier<00:06:53.129> to<00:06:53.580> tell<00:06:53.759> things<00:06:53.999> apart<00:06:54.300> but<00:06:54.960> I

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
lot easier to tell things apart but I

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.540 
lot easier to tell things apart but I
can<00:06:55.169> live<00:06:55.289> with<00:06:55.409> the<00:06:55.499> bad<00:06:55.649> design<00:06:56.039> I<00:06:56.069> suppose

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
can live with the bad design I suppose

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.999 
can live with the bad design I suppose
if<00:06:56.879> the<00:06:57.059> game<00:06:57.270> itself<00:06:57.629> what<00:06:58.529> it<00:06:58.619> sounds<00:06:58.830> like<00:06:58.889> I

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
if the game itself what it sounds like I

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.129 
if the game itself what it sounds like I
hate<00:06:59.279> this<00:06:59.430> game<00:06:59.639> and<00:06:59.819> I<00:06:59.909> don't<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.629> think<00:07:00.839> I'm

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
hate this game and I don't I think I'm

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.420 
hate this game and I don't I think I'm
just<00:07:01.349> really<00:07:01.710> disappointed<00:07:01.740> at<00:07:02.399> the

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
just really disappointed at the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.429 
just really disappointed at the
direction<00:07:02.819> that<00:07:02.999> it<00:07:03.210> headed<00:07:03.479> down<00:07:03.689> I<00:07:03.960> thought

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
direction that it headed down I thought

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.320 
direction that it headed down I thought
it<00:07:04.559> showed<00:07:04.800> a<00:07:04.860> lot<00:07:05.129> of<00:07:05.159> promise<00:07:05.699> and<00:07:05.879> it's<00:07:06.029> just

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
it showed a lot of promise and it's just

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.929 
it showed a lot of promise and it's just
not<00:07:06.599> there<00:07:06.960> for<00:07:07.229> me<00:07:07.259> so<00:07:07.979> maybe<00:07:08.580> that's<00:07:08.849> not

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
not there for me so maybe that's not

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.760 
not there for me so maybe that's not

more of a review as it is just an

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.860 
more of a review as it is just an
opinion<00:07:11.430> on<00:07:11.729> the<00:07:11.849> game<00:07:12.029> but<00:07:12.270> if<00:07:12.509> you're

opinion on the game but if you're

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.499 
doesn't make the claim that it's
simplistic<00:07:19.379> but<00:07:20.129> it<00:07:20.279> certainly<00:07:20.550> doesn't<00:07:21.149> make

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:21.509 
simplistic but it certainly doesn't make
