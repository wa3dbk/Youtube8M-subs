00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and these days I think that fighting

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.529 
and these days I think that fighting
games<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.899> become<00:02:07.079> too<00:02:07.740> complicated<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.880> we

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
decided to get back to basics and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.060 
decided to get back to basics and
concentrate<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.720> simply<00:02:13.470> making<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.890> game

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
concentrate on simply making the game

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
earlier these days we've noticed that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.440 
earlier these days we've noticed that
when<00:03:17.040> you're<00:03:17.190> playing<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.700> 2d<00:03:18.030> fighting<00:03:18.300> game

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
most of them have become very

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.050 
most of them have become very
complicated<00:03:20.730> or<00:03:21.480> very<00:03:22.170> systematic<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.400> when

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
complicated or very systematic so when

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.420 
complicated or very systematic so when
we<00:03:24.180> started<00:03:24.480> making<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> game<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.800> decided<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
we started making the game we decided to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.610 
we started making the game we decided to
focus<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.270> most<00:03:27.450> attractive<00:03:27.960> part<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
focus on the most attractive part of the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.920 
focus on the most attractive part of the
game<00:03:28.830> which<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:29.640> feel<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.270> tension<00:03:30.750> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
game which we feel is the tension and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.870 
game which we feel is the tension and
the<00:03:31.020> feeling<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.920> player<00:03:32.130> gets<00:03:32.490> when<00:03:32.760> they

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the feeling the player gets when they

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.180 
the feeling the player gets when they
hit<00:03:33.030> their<00:03:33.180> opponent<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.680> decided<00:03:35.010> to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
hit their opponent so we decided to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.250 
hit their opponent so we decided to
basically<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:36.150> back<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> simple<00:03:37.050> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
basically go back to the simple and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.620 
basically go back to the simple and
original<00:03:38.100> feel<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.760> people<00:03:39.000> liked<00:03:39.420> about

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630

game's concept which is the clashing
between<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.620> characters<00:04:07.800> we<00:04:08.550> decided<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
between the characters we decided to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.550

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
change the flow of combat so long as you

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.649 
change the flow of combat so long as you
by<00:05:08.379> being<00:05:09.189> able<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.610> use<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:10.090> guard<00:05:10.360> breaks

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.899 
by being able to use the guard breaks
freely<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.680> players<00:05:11.979> chances<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.639> getting
