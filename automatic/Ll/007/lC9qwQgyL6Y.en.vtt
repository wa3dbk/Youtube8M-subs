00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.920
 Hello dear friends with you hatch and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 beasts and today we are frankly new 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
 rubrics are on cons i vatih 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 headings will only talk about 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.269
 minus devices are not afraid of anything and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.670
 really saying horrible things here today 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.840
 on the table person we have samsung galaxy 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
 s4 zoom 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.559
 what it weighs in this apparatus firstly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 This is a lens that is buried. 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.260
 really while I was with him 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.629
 this is such a gemar you died at ru block 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 parade to take pictures there 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.559
 Okay, choose the mode, this is the case 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 way 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.640
 I select the mode and when I bring in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 take a picture then this bandura 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.039
 she 's shorter as he ties or on and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.629
 muddy here and thereafter 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.750
 Okay, there is something on the street and the smoke 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.580
 wipe wipe wipe wipe 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.119
 this is the glass that protects 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 lens 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 this is very inconvenient here this is the first 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 than not killing this machine 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.700
 second when you want to have gatherings Prime 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 yourself and you don't have a tripod here about 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 tripod socket separate talk code to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 out of the photo of yourself here there is a timer 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.579
 example set for 10 seconds or your 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.229
 company to take pictures at the bottom 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.590
 birth you find the surface in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 which you go with the graph royce let's 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 show is here in the computer you will fall 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 set it start the timer let go 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.070
 you he falls 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.100
 how ok 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 samsung ga made a camera with 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.960
 phone, why not 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
 think of making this surface 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.610
 flat here flat 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.020
 why is she rounded here i want 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.520
 something to give a graph or just 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 put beautifully your phone like i 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.090
 he did not bet he will fall he will 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.730
 fall i have a pultik from canon when 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:32.010
 whose help i can put and wala u 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:38.190
 my phone will stand here 2 minus 3 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:42.330
 minus it yes jack for a shoe it and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.180
 sit closed so incomprehensibly incomprehensible 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.880
 white little cap to open it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.480
 Must have 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.519
 button if the girl who will not work 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.430
 So I opened the download for the first time 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.459
 institute 20 here it is 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.989
 how vray cut about now again 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.989
 my awesome camera will focus 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.090
 You see, that's how much time it took to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.130
 the plug is a little ordinary connector 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 with a shoe and this crap you can 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.260
 rub or just not wearing 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.840
 then it will be full of dust is not good 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.489
 about the shoe 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.799
 no complaints on the connector pancake stub 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:39.720
 this is the full meaning here was to do in 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:43.739
 design here's a thing judging by me though not 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.380
 so big just zadrot technology 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.080
 use this thing used 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.410
 mostly on parade to take optics 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.350
 why is she here I do not understand it here 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.530
 really is not clear in the first case 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 I do not know why the device did this 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.870
 here it is this feeling really here 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.740
 is the matrix 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.470
 there is a processor and a camera processor 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.140
 here understand 2 UAH 15 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.140
 but who did it in order to be 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.690
 it looks like a parade did not like it thin 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.710
 a large 200 gram weighs but less than 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.300
 samsung galaxy camera 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:35.120
 but why if we talk about in general 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:40.700
 big minus is a very narrow audience 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:44.550
 which buys this machine if you 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.790
 went somewhere to photograph yes super 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:52.130
 will fit but in ordinary life 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.750
 walk along the street like this 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.010
 maybe not everyone 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.640
 so let's take a closer look 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.460
 so imagine you walk down the street 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.530
 and see a young man or girl 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.780
 is coming and here is what you think how 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.160
 what do you think write in the comments 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.630
 that you will think here I will not even 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.960
 say you write in the comments what are you 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.990
 think of this man who goes 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.450
 so here's the next guard on the minus 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.840
 This display does not understand why you can not 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.000
 was to put the display on s4 normal 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.260
 why 540 by 960 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.500
 the image just looks disgusting 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.810
 when you want to take a picture of something 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.620
 and you look here an image 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.430
 looks awful 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.190
 it feels like the camera is on 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.490
 3 megapixels worth and then who 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.580
 see here 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:57.850
 resolution terribly ogri copper minus 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:00.820
 here is this big connector that you are here 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:06.190
 is here look here is 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.980
 connector for micro beaten and here here 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.830
 such a knob is thick again 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.250
 probably wanted to hide the button 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:20.710
 either something else or no memory card 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:24.550
 I understand shorter minuses a lot first 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.940
 it is awkward to sleep on the display and has 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.370
 at all 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:34.030
 Phone with a device with such uncomfortable 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:36.040
 Well, apparently, and all but stuffing here 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.550
 why find fault here is the usual android 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.280
 it is worth everything else fine 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.610
 camera camera I already said that 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.070
 is it a stupor from yes is a normal gadget 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.470
 gadget unusually knits here if you 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.740
 like this rubric put your fingers 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.340
 up comment and in short I'll 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.950
 keep saying that 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:03.940
 cons of this iphone minus and them there 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:07.330
 dohrena and in short try to keep this 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:10.900
 the topic here is the frank cons of devices 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.150
 in front of gadgets and everything else but he 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.110
 thank you guys and everyone not yet 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.110
