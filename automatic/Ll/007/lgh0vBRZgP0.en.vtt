00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.219
 then since it is a creation space 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.219
 of innovation is a laboratory 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.980
 we started importing different machines 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.380
 assemble the learning and have come to 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.779
 point of what we have learned 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 both of the machines that we have already 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.170
 caught the best part of each machine 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.810
 to create our own designs 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.970
 and this is one of the latest versions 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.290
 that we have now we are making a 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.230
 new that incorporates wifi and you can send 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.830
 to print from your cell phone and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.830
 we are constantly changing 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.600
 they are self-replicating machines in the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.520
 sense that all these white parts 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.040
 they see he made a printer like them 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.760
 the idea is that the machines become 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.859
 almost living beings revolutions 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.760
 All designs are open 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.220
 opensource we are not jealous with patents 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.110
 of inventions all the contrary we know 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.259
 that sharing we are going to advance more 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.119
 fast we are hackers in what sense the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.789
 common knowledge of the hacker is that 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.700
 uses that knowledge to violate or 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.600
 attack to hurt us 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 on the contrary 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.110
 nowadays they print houses they print 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.690
 organs are printed below cellular level or 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.549
 very small and molecular things from a 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.100
 housewife needs replacement 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 to suffer now even a cobbler who 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 wants to try a new shoe sole 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.450
 a hipster that I want a frame of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.580
 glasses if you discover knowledge and what 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.230
 you share in a legal way and what 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.960
 you do is show it to everyone and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.550
 teach it to use in a certain way what 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.490
 what you are doing is empowering the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.270
 people, our mission is to show the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 people that you can be an inventor who 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 we believe that we are capable of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.880
 do what we want that is the dream 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.880
 human
