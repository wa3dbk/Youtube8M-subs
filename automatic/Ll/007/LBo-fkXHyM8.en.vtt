was<00:00:55.489> kind<00:00:55.729> of<00:00:55.760> strumming<00:00:59.860> having<00:01:00.860> two<00:01:01.010> strings

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
was kind of strumming having two strings

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.259 
was kind of strumming having two strings
at<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.519> time<00:01:01.729> to<00:01:01.970> create<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.330> rich<00:01:02.570> kind<00:01:02.809> of

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
at a time to create that rich kind of

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:14.679 
at a time to create that rich kind of
tonal<00:01:05.269> feel<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.490> also<00:01:07.909> put<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:13.689> that

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
tonal feel and then I also put it that

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.010 
tonal feel and then I also put it that
one<00:01:14.869> there<00:01:15.520> picking<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.640> separately<00:01:17.240> but<00:01:17.840> it's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
one there picking it separately but it's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.249 
one there picking it separately but it's
all<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> same<00:01:18.500> notes<00:01:18.740> right<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.930> think<00:01:20.930> in

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
all the same notes right I think in

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:41.660

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.300 

different<00:01:59.789> ways<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.390> fields<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.310> using

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
different ways different fields of using

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
different ways different fields of using
that<00:02:02.460> exact<00:02:02.850> same<00:02:03.090> riff<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.539> so<00:02:03.930> let's<00:02:04.110> zoom

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.630 

also<00:02:21.120> through<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.360> finger<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.930> their<00:02:22.640> second

string through it's a really cool bluesy

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.539 
string through it's a really cool bluesy
court<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.560> basically<00:02:32.010> what<00:02:32.250> we're<00:02:32.370> playing

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
court but basically what we're playing

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.199 
court but basically what we're playing
here

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.360 

is<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:38.810> minor<00:02:39.109> third<00:02:39.409> right<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:39.890> okay<00:02:40.870> so

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
is this minor third right here okay so

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.800 
is this minor third right here okay so
using<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.579> ring<00:02:43.760> finger<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.359> the<00:02:44.599> third

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
using your ring finger on the third

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.349 
using your ring finger on the third
string<00:02:47.920> its<00:02:48.920> line<00:02:49.189> up<00:02:49.430> usually<00:02:49.939> I<00:02:50.000> guess<00:02:50.209> from

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
string its line up usually I guess from

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.080 
string its line up usually I guess from
the<00:02:50.540> third<00:02:50.719> fret<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.290> what<00:02:51.469> I<00:02:51.500> would<00:02:51.590> do

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.330 

so<00:02:58.400> ring<00:02:59.400> finger<00:02:59.730> third<00:03:00.660> string<00:03:01.040> slide<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
so ring finger third string slide up to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.650 
so ring finger third string slide up to
the<00:03:02.430> fourth<00:03:02.670> fret<00:03:03.890> okay<00:03:05.480> then<00:03:06.480> third<00:03:06.990> finger

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
the fourth fret okay then third finger

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.860 
the fourth fret okay then third finger
on<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.820> second<00:03:10.820> string<00:03:11.090> third<00:03:11.860> fret

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.229 

so<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.739> looks<00:03:16.890> basically<00:03:17.670> you're<00:03:18.090> playing

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so it looks basically you're playing

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.009 
so it looks basically you're playing
those<00:03:19.050> two<00:03:19.290> notes<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:20.269> okay<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.840> can

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
those two notes there okay if you can

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:30.320 
those two notes there okay if you can
see<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.379> clearly<00:03:22.650> hopefully<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.209> can

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
see that clearly hopefully so you can

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.960 
see that clearly hopefully so you can
either<00:03:30.420> pick<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> summary<00:03:31.549> or<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.640> can<00:03:32.819> pick

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
either pick a summary or you can pick

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.290 
either pick a summary or you can pick
them<00:03:33.090> together

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.450 

and<00:03:39.260> what<00:03:39.410> we're<00:03:39.530> doing<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.830> we're<00:03:39.980> going<00:03:40.160> down

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
and what we're doing is we're going down

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.620 
and what we're doing is we're going down
to<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> major<00:03:41.690> third<00:03:43.000> which<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.360> just

going<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:02.920> focus<00:04:03.070> too<00:04:03.400> much<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> exact

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
going to focus too much on the exact

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.600 
going to focus too much on the exact
order<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.770> notes<00:04:05.920> because<00:04:06.310> as<00:04:06.460> I've

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
order of the notes because as I've

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
order of the notes because as I've
already<00:04:06.880> showed<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.180> there's<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.450> few

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
already showed you there's a few

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.510 
already showed you there's a few
different<00:04:07.900> ways<00:04:08.020> I'm<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.220> gonna<00:04:09.310> basically

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
different ways I'm just gonna basically

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.640 
different ways I'm just gonna basically
show<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:10.000> which<00:04:10.420> notes<00:04:10.720> are<00:04:10.900> involved<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
show you which notes are involved and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.630 
show you which notes are involved and
then<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:11.860> can<00:04:11.980> come<00:04:12.130> up<00:04:12.160> with<00:04:12.250> your<00:04:12.460> own

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
then you can come up with your own

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.259 
then you can come up with your own
pattern<00:04:17.519> like<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.670> that<00:04:18.760> one<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.000> was<00:04:19.150> playing

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
pattern like in that one I was playing

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.960 
pattern like in that one I was playing
all<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.870> all<00:04:20.340> sorry<00:04:21.340> two<00:04:21.489> strings<00:04:21.760> at<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
all of the all sorry two strings at the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.510 
all of the all sorry two strings at the
same<00:04:22.180> time<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.810> each<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:24.280> each<00:04:24.310> beat<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:27.400> we're

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
same time in each on each beat so we're

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.200 
same time in each on each beat so we're
going<00:04:27.670> from<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.800> minor<00:04:29.800> third<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> major

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
going from this minor third to a major

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
going from this minor third to a major
third

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.840 

this<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.010> easiest<00:04:38.310> part<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.640> little

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
this is the easiest part of the little

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.350 
this is the easiest part of the little
bit<00:04:39.560> this<00:04:40.560> isn't<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:41.100> playing<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.640> second

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
bit this isn't just playing the second

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.860 
bit this isn't just playing the second
and<00:04:42.450> third<00:04:42.630> strings<00:04:42.900> open<00:04:45.620> okay<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:47.460> we've<00:04:47.580> got

and third strings open okay so we've got

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.730 
and third strings open okay so we've got
minor<00:04:48.870> third<00:04:50.000> major<00:04:51.000> third

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.120 

okay<00:05:00.550> now<00:05:01.550> we<00:05:01.640> got<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> fourth<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.540> that's<00:05:03.410> the

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.559 

in<00:06:07.680> that<00:06:08.280> case<00:06:08.520> there<00:06:08.789> I<00:06:08.819> kind<00:06:09.060> of<00:06:09.150> skipped<00:06:09.419> out

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
in that case there I kind of skipped out

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.270 
in that case there I kind of skipped out
the<00:06:09.750> intervals<00:06:10.259> and<00:06:10.440> we<00:06:10.530> bring<00:06:10.710> up<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.039> major

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
and then we just step down through the

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:25.310 
and then we just step down through the
scale<00:06:17.470> right<00:06:23.250> that's<00:06:24.250> on<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.610> third<00:06:24.910> string
