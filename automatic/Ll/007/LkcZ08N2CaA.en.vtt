00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
been sucked out first I start I went

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
been sucked out first I start I went
really<00:00:52.770> hard<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:54.000> buying<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
really hard and I was buying a lot of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.310 
really hard and I was buying a lot of
this<00:00:55.050> rice<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.670> cheap<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this rice was really cheap and then I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.389 
this rice was really cheap and then I
figure<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.120> that<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.399> good

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
figure it out that it's not really good

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
figure it out that it's not really good
for<00:01:02.640> health<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.140> thinking<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.799> know

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
for health and I was thinking you know

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.240 
for health and I was thinking you know
some<00:01:05.659> cost<00:01:06.659> effective<00:01:07.260> food<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
some cost effective food that will be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.719 
some cost effective food that will be
sustaining<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.689> only<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
sustaining because you not only if you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.390 
sustaining because you not only if you
diet<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.810> become<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.380> poor<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> have

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
diet will become more poor and you have

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.899 
diet will become more poor and you have
to<00:01:14.549> live<00:01:14.820> after<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.830> stash<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to live after your stash you have to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289 
to live after your stash you have to
nourish<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.540> body<00:01:18.750> even<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:20.030> buckwheat<00:01:21.030> will

be<00:01:21.509> may<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.810> compared<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> rise<00:01:23.330> fifty<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
be may be compared to rise fifty to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
be may be compared to rise fifty to
sixty<00:01:27.330> percent<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:28.049> expensively<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:29.280> area

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
sixty percent more expensively in area

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
sixty percent more expensively in area
where<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> live<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.590> much

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
where I live I think this is a much

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.910 
where I live I think this is a much
better<00:01:31.979> food<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.750> nourish<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.740> body

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
better food and will a nourish your body

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.120 
better food and will a nourish your body

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so at the end it's not the price per

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
so at the end it's not the price per
kilogram<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.140> nourishing

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
kilogram but how it will be nourishing

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.370 
kilogram but how it will be nourishing

I still alive and I think I trust this
wire<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:48.020> like<00:03:49.020> more<00:03:49.530> than<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.950> city<00:03:50.130> water

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
wire for like more than the city water

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.810 
wire for like more than the city water
of<00:03:51.600> course<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.650> use<00:03:52.800> if<00:03:53.010> it's<00:03:53.190> dirty<00:03:53.489> you

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
of course if you use if it's dirty you

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.479 
of course if you use if it's dirty you
can<00:03:54.030> boil<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.050> again<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.680> find<00:03:56.220> some

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
can boil it but again you can find some

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.420 
can boil it but again you can find some
streams<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.870> find<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:58.440> critics<00:03:59.280> on

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
streams and you can find some critics on

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.100 
streams and you can find some critics on
the<00:03:59.459> mountain<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.420> would<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.780> more

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
the mountain so I would be more

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.490 
the mountain so I would be more
concerned<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.770> store<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:03.000> containers<00:04:03.810> not

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
concerned to store the containers not

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.910 
concerned to store the containers not

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
the wire itself because didn't even need

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.460 
the wire itself because didn't even need
two<00:04:08.190> containers<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.360> transport<00:04:09.900> water<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.380> I
