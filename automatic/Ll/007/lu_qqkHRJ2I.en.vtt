let's<00:00:58.199> talk<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.980> image

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
let's talk about them what is image

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
let's talk about them what is image
stabilisation<00:01:00.090> image<00:01:00.539> stabilization<00:01:00.840> comes

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
stabilisation image stabilization comes

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
stabilisation image stabilization comes
with<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> lens<00:01:01.890> super<00:01:02.879> important<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
with this lens super important to have

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
with this lens super important to have
especially<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.170> heavy<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.460> much

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
especially as heavy as it is how much

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
especially as heavy as it is how much
weight<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> add<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.720> camera

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
weight it's going to add to your camera

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.230 
weight it's going to add to your camera
so<00:01:07.740> having<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> stabilization<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
so having them the stabilization is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
so having them the stabilization is
going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> huge<00:01:09.960> difference<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to make a huge difference for you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
going to make a huge difference for you
and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.580> say<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> top

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and I would say this is one of the top

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
and I would say this is one of the top
lenses<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.110> should<00:01:13.320> own<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.770> catalog<00:01:14.490> or

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
lenses you should own in your catalog or

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.280 
lenses you should own in your catalog or
at<00:01:14.790> least<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.270> opinion<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.080> really

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
at least in my opinion it is I really

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740 
at least in my opinion it is I really
love<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> 70-200<00:01:17.580> gives<00:01:18.090> me<00:01:18.210> quite<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> range

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
love the 70-200 gives me quite a range

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
love the 70-200 gives me quite a range
to<00:01:18.869> shoot<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.189> pictures<00:01:20.549> are

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to shoot from and the pictures are

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109 
to shoot from and the pictures are
always<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.600> sharp<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> beautiful<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
always just sharp and beautiful so the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.179 
always just sharp and beautiful so the
difference<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.720> lens<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> comes

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
difference with this lens is it comes

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
difference with this lens is it comes
