00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
sometimes comes to the fore like that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.990 
sometimes comes to the fore like that
and<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:15.860> not<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.040> nice<00:03:16.190> place<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.610> be<00:03:16.640> if<00:03:16.850> you
