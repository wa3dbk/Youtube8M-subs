00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.370
 because you have the flag of the states 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:10.240
 together we are on the moon 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.240
 ah 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.230
 How are you 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:25.779
 once you know how to make money 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.770
 and being on the moon also physically 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 how are these characters used to 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.390
 take perspective of the earth 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.230
 ah 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.340
 If you want to kill me pastor here in my 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 happy house 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.320
 good 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.410
 when I started to wonder what is it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.020
 what was there in that forgetfulness of when are you 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.390
 small, not if that forgetfulness is that there is no 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.670
 nothing or if really in that forgetfulness there is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 memories or sensations that remain in the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 unconscious and that appear later in 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.760
 later memories that you have 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.060
 then there is a whole material there that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.860
 is mixed with the dream of things 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.740
 that you have been told that you do not know if they are 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.560
 true or not they are a very material 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 unstable very diluted but on which 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 the rest of the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 memory 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.870
 and on which almost life is built 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.870
 to you liked your father
