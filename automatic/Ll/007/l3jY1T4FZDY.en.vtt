Liverpool where I've come to see three
cytogeneticist<00:00:14.219> s--<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.360> sure<00:00:15.389> if

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
cytogeneticist s-- now I'm not sure if

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.849 
cytogeneticist s-- now I'm not sure if
you<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.590> don't

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
you know what they are because I don't

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.290 
you know what they are because I don't
so<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.400> only<00:00:17.520> go<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> genetics<00:00:18.180> department

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
so we only go to the genetics department

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.439 
so we only go to the genetics department

my career path so far has been to do

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.460 
my career path so far has been to do
GCSEs<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> did<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.870> levels<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.320> biology

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
GCSEs and then I did a levels in biology

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.530 
GCSEs and then I did a levels in biology
chemistry<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.220> maths<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> went<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
chemistry and maths and then I went to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.210 
chemistry and maths and then I went to
Liverpool<00:00:39.719> University<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> did<00:00:40.770> genetics

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
Liverpool University and did genetics

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.639 
Liverpool University and did genetics
degree<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:42.390> favorite<00:00:42.780> subject<00:00:43.199> at<00:00:43.320> school<00:00:43.350> was

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
degree my favorite subject at school was

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.930 
degree my favorite subject at school was
biology<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> whole<00:00:44.879> way

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
biology pretty much the whole way

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150 
biology pretty much the whole way
through<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.290> liked<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.769> sciences

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
through and I liked the other sciences

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
through and I liked the other sciences
as<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.839> really<00:00:49.199> enjoyed

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
as well and I also really enjoyed

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.149 
as well and I also really enjoyed
languages<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.900> let's<00:00:51.900> get<00:00:52.290> them<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> level

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
languages so let's get them to a level

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.160 
languages so let's get them to a level
just<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> give<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.970> variation<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
just to give you a bit of variation and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
just to give you a bit of variation and
for<00:00:55.650> my<00:00:55.739> degree<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.100> did<00:00:56.220> medical<00:00:56.730> genetics<00:00:57.180> at

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
for my degree I did medical genetics at

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
for my degree I did medical genetics at
the<00:00:57.390> University<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.989> Sheffield<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.890> school<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the University of Sheffield in school I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.509 
the University of Sheffield in school I
enjoyed<00:00:59.790> most<00:01:00.149> subjects<00:01:01.040> my<00:01:02.040> favorite<00:01:02.430> was

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
enjoyed most subjects my favorite was

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.549 
enjoyed most subjects my favorite was
probably<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.059> sciences<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.289> I<00:01:04.350> wouldn't

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
probably the sciences and I wouldn't

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
probably the sciences and I wouldn't
really<00:01:04.649> say<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> hated<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.460> subject<00:01:05.970> although

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
really say I hated a subject although

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.930 
really say I hated a subject although
religious<00:01:07.020> studies<00:01:07.320> wasn't<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.160> forte

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.790 

so<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.510> a<00:01:15.540> centrifuge<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.620> blood

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
so this is a centrifuge and the blood

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.680 
so this is a centrifuge and the blood
samples<00:01:17.160> are<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.120> here<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> spin

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
samples are actually put in here to spin

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.570 
samples are actually put in here to spin
them<00:01:18.870> down<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:20.120> remove<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.450> red<00:01:21.870> blood<00:01:22.050> cells

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
them down to remove the red blood cells

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.069 
them down to remove the red blood cells
from<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.730> hypertonic<00:01:24.060> solution

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.810 

the<00:01:30.619> samples<00:01:30.979> are<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:31.189> put<00:01:31.369> into<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.609> class

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the samples are then put into a class

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.599 
the samples are then put into a class
two<00:01:32.060> safety<00:01:32.420> cabinet<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.609> hypertonic

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
two safety cabinet and the hypertonic

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.730 
two safety cabinet and the hypertonic
potassium<00:01:35.600> chloride<00:01:35.869> solution<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.409> removed

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
potassium chloride solution is removed

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.029 
potassium chloride solution is removed
from<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.130> sample<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.649> bottom<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
from the sample in the bottom of the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.859 
from the sample in the bottom of the
tube<00:01:40.219> is<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.579> white<00:01:40.880> blood<00:01:41.060> cells<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.689> it's

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
tube is the white blood cells so it's

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.590 
tube is the white blood cells so it's
the<00:01:42.740> chromosomes<00:01:43.219> which<00:01:43.429> we<00:01:43.610> look<00:01:44.030> at<00:01:44.210> on<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
the chromosomes which we look at on the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.430 
the chromosomes which we look at on the
metaphase

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.540 

I<00:01:48.520> knew<00:01:49.520> obviously<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.210> liked<00:01:50.480> em<00:01:51.460> biology<00:01:52.460> and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
I knew obviously I liked em biology and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.690 
I knew obviously I liked em biology and
chemistry<00:01:52.670> at<00:01:53.090> school<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.370> wanted

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
chemistry at school and I like I wanted

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.730 
chemistry at school and I like I wanted
to<00:01:55.790> continue<00:01:56.030> with<00:01:56.240> biology<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.530> then

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
to continue with biology and and then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.020 
to continue with biology and and then
you<00:01:57.830> didn't<00:01:58.070> want<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.370> as<00:01:58.490> medicine<00:01:58.880> so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
you didn't want to here as medicine so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.340 
you didn't want to here as medicine so
had<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.210> look<00:01:59.390> at<00:01:59.600> what<00:01:59.720> other<00:01:59.870> careers<00:02:00.200> were

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
had to look at what other careers were

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.940 
had to look at what other careers were

loved<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.560> decided<00:02:10.070> from<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.250> moment

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
loved it and decided from that moment

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.490 
loved it and decided from that moment
that's<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:10.910> wanted<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.300> do<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:12.050> moment<00:02:12.410> of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
that's what I wanted to do my moment of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800 
that's what I wanted to do my moment of
inspiration<00:02:12.770> was<00:02:13.580> because<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.270> enjoyed<00:02:14.630> doing

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
inspiration was because I enjoyed doing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.380 
inspiration was because I enjoyed doing
science<00:02:15.290> at<00:02:15.530> GCSE<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.370> followed<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.820> at<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.030> level

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
science at GCSE I followed it at a level

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.450 
science at GCSE I followed it at a level
and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:18.140> my<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> level<00:02:18.740> teacher<00:02:18.920> inspired<00:02:19.340> me

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
and then my a level teacher inspired me

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.839 
and then my a level teacher inspired me
to<00:02:19.580> do<00:02:19.670> genetics<00:02:20.180> so

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.459 

part<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.359> we<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.629> much<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.019> results

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
part is there we how much you results

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.309 
part is there we how much you results
impact<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.219> patients<00:02:28.209> real-life<00:02:28.810> patients

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
impact on patients real-life patients

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.629 
impact on patients real-life patients
and<00:02:29.469> knowing<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:29.980> send<00:02:30.159> them<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:30.430> an

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
and knowing if you send them out an

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.190 
and knowing if you send them out an
abnormal<00:02:31.389> result<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:31.780> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.959> affect

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
abnormal result that's going to affect

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.479 
abnormal result that's going to affect
them<00:02:32.319> for<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.530> rest<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.799> their<00:02:32.980> lives<00:02:33.129> so<00:02:33.459> I

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
them for the rest of their lives so I

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.250 
them for the rest of their lives so I
think<00:02:33.639> that's<00:02:33.879> actually<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.810> sort<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.109> this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
think that's actually it's sort of this

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.899 
think that's actually it's sort of this
sort<00:02:35.409> of<00:02:35.560> more<00:02:35.769> emotional<00:02:36.219> part<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.579> it<00:02:36.700> that's

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
sort of more emotional part of it that's

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.250 
sort of more emotional part of it that's
harder<00:02:37.209> than<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.510> educational<00:02:38.319> side<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710 

and<00:02:43.640> obviously<00:02:44.640> being<00:02:44.879> in<00:02:44.970> genetics<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.569> work

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
and obviously being in genetics we work

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.470 
and obviously being in genetics we work
very<00:02:45.750> case<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.319> genetic<00:02:46.709> counselors<00:02:47.340> who<00:02:48.030> sort

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
very case of genetic counselors who sort

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.119 
very case of genetic counselors who sort
of<00:02:48.510> feud<00:02:48.720> our<00:02:48.840> results<00:02:49.110> back<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> patients<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
of feud our results back to patients and

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.070 
of feud our results back to patients and
we<00:02:50.190> work<00:02:50.340> closely<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.730> them<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.780> because

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
we work closely with them but because

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.780 
we work closely with them but because
you<00:02:52.200> receive<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.709> such<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> wide<00:02:53.310> variety<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you receive a such a wide variety of

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.820 
you receive a such a wide variety of
samples<00:02:54.269> from<00:02:54.450> bone<00:02:54.810> marrows<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.349> leukemia

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
samples from bone marrows from leukemia

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.130 
samples from bone marrows from leukemia
patients<00:02:56.340> through<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.730> prenatal<00:02:57.450> amniotic

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
patients through to prenatal amniotic

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.500 
patients through to prenatal amniotic
fluid<00:02:58.620> samples<00:02:59.069> we<00:02:59.640> deal<00:02:59.790> with<00:02:59.819> a<00:03:00.000> wide<00:03:00.180> range

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
fluid samples we deal with a wide range

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.539 
fluid samples we deal with a wide range
of<00:03:00.629> consultants<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.590> including<00:03:02.190> midwives

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
of consultants and including midwives

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.350 
of consultants and including midwives
and<00:03:02.879> so<00:03:04.099> are<00:03:05.099> sensitive<00:03:05.670> happen<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.120> lot<00:03:06.269> of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and so are sensitive happen a lot of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.260 
and so are sensitive happen a lot of
people<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.379> NHS

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.730 

so<00:03:12.810> after<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> slides<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.770> been

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
so after the slides have been

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.380 
so after the slides have been
but<00:03:15.070> then<00:03:15.220> go<00:03:15.340> into<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.670> slide<00:03:15.880> making<00:03:16.240> room

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
but then go into the slide making room

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.550 
but then go into the slide making room
where<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.720> slides<00:03:16.900> are<00:03:17.110> prepared<00:03:17.410> with

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
where it slides are prepared with

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.130 
where it slides are prepared with
patient<00:03:17.950> details<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.600> cultured

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
patient details and then the cultured

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.020 
patient details and then the cultured
cells<00:03:20.380> are<00:03:20.500> dropped<00:03:20.710> onto<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.130> slide<00:03:21.340> those

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
cells are dropped onto the slide those

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.250 
cells are dropped onto the slide those
slides<00:03:22.330> are<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:22.540> taken<00:03:22.870> through<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
slides are then taken through to the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.580 
slides are then taken through to the
bandaging<00:03:23.680> room<00:03:23.920> where<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.720> dinner<00:03:26.140> enzyme

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
bandaging room where the dinner enzyme

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.960 
bandaging room where the dinner enzyme
called<00:03:26.770> trypsin<00:03:27.220> which<00:03:27.280> strips<00:03:27.730> away<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
called trypsin which strips away the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.370 
called trypsin which strips away the
proteins<00:03:28.480> from<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.720> chromosomes<00:03:29.260> that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
proteins from the chromosomes that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.010 
proteins from the chromosomes that
allows<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.860> stain<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.280> enter<00:03:30.670> them<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.060> then

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
allows the stain to enter them and then

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.540 
allows the stain to enter them and then
rinsed<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.380> buffer<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.800> left<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.100> stain<00:03:33.340> for

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
rinsed in a buffer and left in stain for

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.610 
rinsed in a buffer and left in stain for
two<00:03:33.700> minutes<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.600> allows<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.260> banding

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
two minutes and this allows the banding

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.190 
two minutes and this allows the banding
pattern<00:03:35.920> we<00:03:36.040> use<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.430> analysis<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.840> put

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
pattern we use for analysis to be put

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.000 
pattern we use for analysis to be put
onto<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> chromosomes

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.140 

you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.500 

and<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.290> started<00:03:51.040> my<00:03:51.159> training<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.849> October<00:03:52.420> of

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
and I started my training in October of

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.750 
and I started my training in October of
last<00:03:52.540> year<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.980> should<00:03:54.190> currently<00:03:54.580> be

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
last year so it should currently be

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.100 
last year so it should currently be
between<00:03:55.060> two<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.420> three<00:03:55.480> years<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.989> finish

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
between two and three years to finish

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.809 
between two and three years to finish
the<00:03:56.349> train<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.890> then<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.489> two<00:03:57.670> years

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
the train and then you have two years

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.289 
the train and then you have two years
consolidation<00:03:58.569> as<00:03:58.690> well<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.760> after<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
consolidation as well so after that I

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.800 
consolidation as well so after that I
should<00:04:01.510> be<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.599> qualified<00:04:02.049> clinical<00:04:02.950> scientist

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.380 

after<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.800> slides<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.640> been<00:04:09.670> banded<00:04:10.240> we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
after the slides have been banded we

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.840 
after the slides have been banded we
need<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.140> look<00:04:11.350> at<00:04:11.650> meta<00:04:11.950> phases<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.700> do

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
need to go and look at meta phases to do

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.580 
need to go and look at meta phases to do
an<00:04:12.970> analysis<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:14.020> used<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.410> use

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
an analysis and we used to use

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.159 
an analysis and we used to use
microscopes<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.610> methodically<00:04:16.299> scan<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
microscopes to methodically scan the

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.590 
microscopes to methodically scan the
slides<00:04:17.470> looking<00:04:17.889> for<00:04:18.160> certain<00:04:18.970> meta<00:04:19.150> phases

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.110 
slides looking for certain meta phases
to<00:04:19.780> do<00:04:19.900> our<00:04:20.079> analysis<00:04:20.230> that<00:04:20.769> however<00:04:21.730> took

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
to do our analysis that however took

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.780 
to do our analysis that however took

you

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.679 

what<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:40.409> have<00:04:40.560> now<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.210> automatic<00:04:42.210> machine

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
what we have now is a automatic machine

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.770 
what we have now is a automatic machine
which<00:04:43.099> scans<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.310> slides<00:04:44.610> for<00:04:45.150> us<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.599> we

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
which scans the slides for us that we

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.659 
which scans the slides for us that we
tell<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.080> computer<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:47.039> type<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.430> metal

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
tell the computer the type of metal

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.029 
tell the computer the type of metal
phases<00:04:48.240> basically<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.199> quality<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> meta

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
phases basically the quality of the meta

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.279 
phases basically the quality of the meta
phases<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.699> look<00:04:50.849> for<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.719> computer<00:04:52.139> will

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
phases to look for the computer will

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.369 
phases to look for the computer will
analyze<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:53.669> slides<00:04:54.000> choose<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.139> best

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
analyze the slides choose the best

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.730 
analyze the slides choose the best
quality<00:04:56.159> meta<00:04:56.729> phases<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.449> then<00:04:58.080> we<00:04:58.379> can

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
quality meta phases and then we can

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.459 
quality meta phases and then we can
analyze<00:04:59.400> those<00:04:59.669> chromosomes<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.659> so<00:05:01.139> it's<00:05:01.289> it

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
analyze those chromosomes and so it's it

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.040 
analyze those chromosomes and so it's it
does<00:05:01.800> save<00:05:02.069> a<00:05:02.099> lot<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.430> time<00:05:02.759> okay<00:05:03.419> after<00:05:03.629> all

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
does save a lot of time okay after all

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.540 
does save a lot of time okay after all

bending<00:05:09.620> scanning<00:05:10.759> this<00:05:11.759> is<00:05:11.909> what<00:05:12.120> our

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
bending scanning this is what our

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.510 
bending scanning this is what our
ultimate<00:05:12.750> aim<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.169> to<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:13.740> our<00:05:14.039> pair

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
ultimate aim is to have our pair

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.209 
ultimate aim is to have our pair
chromosomes<00:05:15.199> bonnet<00:05:16.199> on<00:05:16.379> a<00:05:16.409> screen<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.069> we<00:05:17.190> can

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
chromosomes bonnet on a screen so we can

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.850 
chromosomes bonnet on a screen so we can
compare<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:18.449> banding<00:05:19.020> patterns<00:05:19.349> between<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
compare the banding patterns between the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.950 
compare the banding patterns between the
pair<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.280> chromosomes<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:21.509> look<00:05:21.659> for<00:05:21.810> any

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
pair of chromosomes to look for any

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.430 
pair of chromosomes to look for any
differences<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.159> we<00:05:23.280> can<00:05:23.490> sort<00:05:24.389> of<00:05:24.449> diagnose

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
differences so we can sort of diagnose

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.499 
differences so we can sort of diagnose
any<00:05:25.680> abnormality<00:05:26.490> there<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:26.909> classic<00:05:27.240> one<00:05:27.360> is

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
any abnormality there the classic one is

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.350 
any abnormality there the classic one is
Down<00:05:27.990> syndrome<00:05:28.590> where<00:05:29.039> we<00:05:29.190> were<00:05:29.699> looking<00:05:30.180> for

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
Down syndrome where we were looking for

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.779 
Down syndrome where we were looking for
an<00:05:30.539> extra<00:05:30.930> chromosome<00:05:31.560> 21<00:05:32.279> so<00:05:32.610> we'd<00:05:32.759> have

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
an extra chromosome 21 so we'd have

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.850 
an extra chromosome 21 so we'd have
instead<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.509> two<00:05:33.719> instead<00:05:34.349> of<00:05:34.440> having<00:05:34.529> two

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
instead of two instead of having two

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.589 
instead of two instead of having two
copies<00:05:35.069> of<00:05:35.219> chromosome<00:05:35.550> 21<00:05:35.669> we'd<00:05:36.180> have<00:05:36.330> three

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
copies of chromosome 21 we'd have three

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.320 
copies of chromosome 21 we'd have three
copies<00:05:36.779> of<00:05:37.169> chromosome<00:05:37.740> 21<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.669> there<00:05:38.819> you<00:05:38.879> go

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
copies of chromosome 21 so there you go

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.240 
copies of chromosome 21 so there you go
I<00:05:39.360> think<00:05:39.689> you'll<00:05:39.779> agree<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.250> cytogenetics

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
I think you'll agree that cytogenetics

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.339 
I think you'll agree that cytogenetics
