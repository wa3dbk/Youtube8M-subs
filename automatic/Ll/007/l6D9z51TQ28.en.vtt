00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 at youtube here plays the number of 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 capital and had one right 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.569
 Cool idea lately and I want that 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.120
 now realize in a small 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.110
 series on my channel and though 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.700
 Maybe you can not do it that way 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 really series but the theme is so 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 extensive that I have it on several 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.740
 it must be split videos plays splits 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 Just because I want a bit 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.890
 Talk about it like me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.330
 'youtube' started like me 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.830
 it was all about me and what happened to me 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.449
 then moved and inspired 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.400
 ever to start the youtube channel 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 and then of course how to get up 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.789
 youtube evolve and what you do 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 from this community takes me and me 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.669
 I thought so yes if they are one 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 little bit about the beginnings of me 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.370
 then it fits very well if I mean 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140
 The four team complicates the whole thing 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.600
 still use deathmatch gameplays 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 and the call of duty 4 was like that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 a bit of a start at all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 just the big of the big multiplayer of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 call of duty but was also in like that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 starting shot for the whole youtube scene 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 he was then the american space 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.629
 and that's why it fits 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 of a place quite well this is a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 six against six team deathmatch up 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
 the map overground 43 until the end and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 but that should already be the case 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 have been gameplay and then start 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.770
 I just because it is really 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.329
 much I have to tell you and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.070
 Although indirectly , the whole has actually 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.140
 that started a buddy of mine 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.939
 at that time always a sword of the school time 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 when mw2 was outside with a few 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.390
 Colleagues always get together once or twice 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 has met and then they have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.890
 only four in private play bit 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
 mw2 stopped gambling and he has relative 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 quickly realized that he was one of the best 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 this guy may even be the guy 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.610
 best and then takes his too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.869
 challenge in multiplayer 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.159
 and then he also noticed that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.900
 the multiplayer but something else 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.700
 It's as if you're just four 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 a bit splitscreen mode provides 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 Well and then have a look 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.619
 youtube is now looking around if it is there 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 tips and tricks videos are available 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.009
 can improve in call of duty 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 and behold then how youtube 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.570
 moody's gamertag wings of redemption 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.939
 excalibur swatch or chinas bumped 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 and that was, so to speak, the beginning 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.720
 actually that I knew somebody 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.710
 youtube videos and i have 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.820
 but not me then 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.009
 really taken care of it i had yes 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 so a little break with mw2 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 because I've never gambled that actively 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 and in the end it was me too 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.240
 if I was with him somehow no matter what 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.860
 he does not make me that tall 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 So he took care of that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 I looked so know a bit 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.340
 by the way, that he is there with call of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 duty videos busy but never got the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.940
 Really perceived and then me 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.400
 himself has begun on the xbox 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 with black ops and next to me too 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.070
 a certain time in this game 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
 I just found it then 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.520
 also somehow realized that yourself 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.110
 maybe one way or the other 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.150
 maybe even make some tips 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.800
 could pick up and have me there again 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 so a bit reminiscent of my buddy 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.950
 and I also have live at xbox 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.300
 always met new people 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 and then they always have 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 she says that on youtube, too 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.690
 watch videos and just took 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.920
 mentioned the max fps or otherwise and so 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.420
 I then came to it at all 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 that I could try it myself 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.770
 to look at youtube videos and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 I have a few things then 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.430
 a given because I'm still there 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.830
 I was quite inexperienced with it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.580
 actually no youtuber myself 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.050
 These names I all now 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.640
 I knew of those 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.410
 which we have never had anything before 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.840
 heard and then I am the first 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.850
 evenly also closed to max and apps 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.350
 At that time he had 2,500 subscribers or 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.480
 So what was there, the German 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.820
 community still practical in the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.960
 child shoes and the American 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.400
 Cabin I have somehow never like that 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.540
 I also perceived correctly 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.100
 nothing is found 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.390
 funny somehow because that's me 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.060
 Fate really on the German 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.950
 then brought the community directly 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.170
 and you have just the videos then 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.580
 looked at by the and then always 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.870
 more active then I have it more and more 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.520
 I had fun at the beginning 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.930
 no idea maybe such a two 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.980
 Watched the videos times a week and that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 has then really increased purely 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.010
 and somehow to black ops, there were also 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.110
 with me again a real new one 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.820
 call of duty high time because I hold myself 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.770
 not just to offer this new 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.500
 get used to the xbox gameplay at all 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.480
 but because somehow after 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
 mw2 which i never really played 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.019
 have and then just call of duty 4 and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.250
 call of duty 5 a bit 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.470
 leached out so much again 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.269
 yes this whole call of duty feeling in 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.530
 new tasks and i had new tasks 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.330
 after the abi then pretty much too 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.340
 time and then just call back again 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.480
 Duty really actively gambled and so am 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.010
 I even thought about it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.420
 that I then in youtube videos 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.560
 I looked at that time 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.400
 but never so low down 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.959
 thought of my own 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.880
 youtube-channel founds then came first 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.330
 a bit later than I realized then 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.920
 Hey somehow you really can 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.200
 but now relative again 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.390
 good gamble on the xbox the people you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.640
 they know they actually share this 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.410
 opinion and mine too that you are 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.060
 quite a good player and I have 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.919
 then more and more people are in the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.410
 German community have always looked 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.850
 again discovered new commentators and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.090
 But somehow I noticed it is missing 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.470
 a bit a youtuber of not only 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.910
 good play but also good 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.620
 Both can be combined 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.880
 because there were either good players or 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.900
 good commentators and since I have my 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.250
 somehow thought because many of me too 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.229
 People have said your voice sounds 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.580
 but reasonably well and gambled 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.620
 Can you do it well? 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.320
 actually for you a starting signal to 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.760
 youtube something to start 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.710
 and of course I was in the beginning 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.880
 a bit skeptical thought you have this 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.380
 youtube.com not that that matters so well 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.320
 if you tell your friend , I'll do it 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.700
 youtube videos or so but in the end 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.430
 I did not really care what happened 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.400
 my friends think and have about it 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.720
 then just said hey you tube me 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.460
 personally is fun to watch video 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.050
 why should not do it and then 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.030
 I have just because I have just a few 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.770
 youtuber a few smaller youtubers 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.750
 personally knew how for example the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.979
 I thought then tesco and here 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.539
 used to say hey come on do but 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.669
 your own youtube channel too 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.710
 then they have me just a bit 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.740
 the inspiration for the year 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.479
 given in addition and that was then 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.310
 so to speak, the starting shot that told me 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.020
 hey 23 I will be my own 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.460
 Start youtube-channel and say so 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.419
 I'll see you until the next episode 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.419
 for the next title
