00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.640
 Last time I bought a pc 900 yen or I said less than 2 weeks 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.549
 I have a past that 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.079
 I bought a new netbook again for one public 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.039
 Saw 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.759
 This time 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.189
 Fujitsu looxu 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.009
 I told you to say 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.609
 In the city, here one is old and the latest is 40 in c30 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.119
 It seems that the production of the latter was convincing 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.569
 I'm sorry 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.039
 For me 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.879
 When it is tongue Caesar era 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.860
 Graphics performance is low 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830
 Because it is such a thing 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.870
 It is one old model now 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 I bought an actress construction 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 For town specs 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.630
 Intel's 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 Circle 110 processor is 800mhz 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.909
 It is 110 without the classic brand name 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.380
 Sakata has only 20 balls 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.530
 And 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.790
 Memory is one battle 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.550
 This is possible 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 With one side 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.300
 I'm sorry 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.980
 I do not know because I am not leaving but I am behind 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.420
 Rather it was only hd that can be accessed from 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 And 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.490
 Live graphic chip 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060
 Same as other netbooks 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.460
 with gma950 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.160
 It is like that 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.510
 I was able to get xp and vista small s 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.170
 It was a long tail model 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.840
 The first model is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.270
 Do you say you have Ceresso 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.920
 There is also a model that is equipped with 7 to 0 in combination with the xp model 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.320
 When 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 Did you also say 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 As tablet function is attached safely 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 in this way 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 Because it and the function are attached 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.310
 If it is not vista to use the tablet function 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 So I was together 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.509
 And 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.819
 There is one segment in Makocha and there is a lot 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.199
 Sideways sd card slot 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.599
 Horizontal 2 sheets quint 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.809
 even if you say so 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.459
 And you're here? One usb port 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.879
 It is a little painful that there is only one 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.730
 And there is a cf card slot here, but an individual 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.730
 I think I would like to use each city 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.499
 I'm lucky 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.679
 Governor wreck 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.239
 It is the same service as this netbook 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.619
 There is no need to worry about feeding every day 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.309
 but 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.539
 This is very nice 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.849
 It is small so small 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.149
 It means that the number of keys is small 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.149
 si being very hentai 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.189
 I agree 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.469
 The blue one is 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 Yless this in combination with the function key 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.509
 The cursor is 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.979
 I have to make sure that the function key is the same 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 Because the large angle is shallow in the standard 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.459
 this 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.069
 I can not change the cursor function key 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.790
 In the form of a standard 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.419
 I 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 I wanted to change it, but I want to use it very much during this time 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:15.979
 f1 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.979
 Unusual hope this is 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.229
 And 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.009
 If you say why you wanted this now 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
 I am a little nice pc900 series 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.229
 I was sorry I was thinking 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.009
 It is said that all cities are improved here 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.909
 At first size 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.649
 Murderer 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:41.999
 Even in Kansai 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.929
 People are also gold 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.479
 If it becomes transfer outside when put in a bag 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.350
 In that 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.169
 Even smaller than that 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.169
 Do you carry around your paperback books early? 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.389
 This is the size of that body 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.479
 This is a normal paperback book 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.509
 Really paperback book size 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.829
 And also Mr. Dai 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.829
 It is not a level that 1 kilo finished 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.299
 Canissales in a position to carry a plastic bottle 500 ml 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.149
 This is 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.439
 And because it's time to install the battery 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.620
 Carry one plastic bottle in the state of Sumisho Europe 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.319
 If you can carry it with your senses 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.159
 About that 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.409
 Question pact light 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.729
 And for the second one 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.499
 There were many people one by one before 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.509
 Lottery ssd said Andy touch freeze 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.100
 Because I had that terrible eye, this time 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.509
 Toshiba's 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.889
 1814 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.889
 I chose a hard disk 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.900
 And again 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.930
 The decisive factor is the tablet function 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.779
 Somehow it looks interesting 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.599
 And maximize ginkgo and tablet function 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.599
 As we looked for vista to use effectively 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.409
 I'm sure I want to use the tablet function 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.409
 Even in this style, it can be used at the time of torch relay 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.059
 To make a tablet pc 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.729
 I want to do a little bit in tablet style 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:05.460
 I think 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.880
 Because it rotates for this made this comfortable once at the waist 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.699
 The software association is only once 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.349
 Seto City Ayaka which will judge the cost side 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.520
 I'm stuck with the pointer 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.789
 Now right click and bea left click right click 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.250
 Of course I can do it, but without tabletpc 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.509
 It is pointed out with tablet Takun 4 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.800
 It is also possible to go ahead 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.990
 Run victory pace 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.990
 There is a tablet function in Tamagawa 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 I want to come back to Matsui 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.150
 The government has been around for a while 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.210
 Without the tablet function 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.960
 When you enter something like this search bar 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.520
 I can not do well, there is no hope 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.270
 So you end up giving me 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.189
 Are you positive if you click this? 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.159
 Click sec again 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.229
 From countries that can be called from software company behavior 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.529
 You mean it's attractive 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.069
 Type in 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.339
 Not only the sound actually 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.339
 For example, there is a flick function 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:17.150
 there 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.710
 If you try to do so, the screen scrolls 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.089
 There is 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.569
 However 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.669
 And after 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:26.610
 Next to this 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.749
 Click next to 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.289
 Advance 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.309
 If you click narrowly, you will go back to voice back 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.520
 I'm on the seat Japan service 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
 It has spread in a good shape and has become a PC 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.850
 At one time c30 that hentai keyboard is improved a little 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.159
 Well done 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.159
 At least that 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.629
 As each device and third place seem to change 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.279
 By default 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.279
 When Ako good opportunity is usable 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.049
 Such measures to break the keyboard may be good 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.069
 I tried to use the city for a while 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.930
 vista 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.389
 What a bit motdy to do anything 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:21.279
 windows7 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.589
 I would like to install hot 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:27.949
 Scores that the benchmark also took a fine score 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.969
 As we accompany plan book 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.389
 Who cares about here 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.389
 I think that only programmer access 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.159
 I sat down
