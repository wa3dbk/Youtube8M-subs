00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.630 
them is outstanding plastic models more
often<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.520> about

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
often than not it's just not about

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
often than not it's just not about
building<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.390> model<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.110> building<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
building the model but building a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.980 
building the model but building a
collection<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> models<00:01:38.659> dollhouse<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
collection of models dollhouse is it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
collection of models dollhouse is it
kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:40.380> way<00:01:40.770> basically<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.850> can

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
kind of the same way basically they can

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
kind of the same way basically they can
take<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> build<00:01:42.600> their<00:01:42.840> dream<00:01:43.110> house<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
take and build their dream house and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
take and build their dream house and
what<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.220> consider<00:01:44.369> miniature<00:01:45.060> scale

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
what we would consider miniature scale

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.990 
what we would consider miniature scale
where<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.229> inch<00:01:46.439> represents<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:47.130> foot<00:01:47.430> but

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
where one inch represents a foot but

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
where one inch represents a foot but
they<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.240> take<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> create<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.320> house<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
they can take and create this house and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
they can take and create this house and
wallpaper<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.460> decorate<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.630> also<00:01:51.780> carry

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
wallpaper and decorate it we also carry

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.960 
wallpaper and decorate it we also carry
a<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.350> extensive<00:01:52.649> inventory<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.460> trains

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
a pretty extensive inventory of trains

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
a pretty extensive inventory of trains
one<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> things<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.049> try<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> have

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
one of the things that we try to have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
one of the things that we try to have
here<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.009> pretty<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.490> complement<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.540> what

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
here a pretty good complement of of what

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
here a pretty good complement of of what
we<00:01:58.140> consider<00:01:58.469> building<00:01:58.770> supplies<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.610> would

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
we consider building supplies that would

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.240 
we consider building supplies that would
be<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
be the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550 
be the
and<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.730> tools<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.810> basically<00:02:02.170> be<00:02:02.350> able<00:02:02.440> to

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and the tools to basically be able to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.590 
and the tools to basically be able to
