00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.190
 What kind of thing can we do by using the sky track of bones? 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.870
 How do you get accurate ball data ? 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.540
 Yes 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.090
 In the main story, the difference between Skytrack's superior ballistic analysis mechanism and other companies' sensors 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.480
 Let's talk about 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 Ballistic measuring instruments are roughly divided into two types 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.279
 First of all, it is because of the guard puller type that tracks golf balls . 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.680
 I 'll track the actual ball, so to use outside 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.079
 Doppler can be said to be effective, but the effect is reduced due to bad weather and wind. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 It may not be accurately measured Sky Author 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:45.909
 The other hole is a quick-action camera type sensor like Skytrack. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:51.460
 In response to the strike and the operation of the ball as the use and the winding configuration 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:54.399
 Several images of the mall are taken and the measurement data will be displayed instantly. 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.290
 The effect is not reduced by the influence of the weather etc. 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.920
 It can be used indoors or outdoors 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.020
 Place the ball in the Note to the First point indicated by the laser 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:11.630
 It is a trigger format that uses infrared light and is shot in response to motion 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:16.550
 After the shot a continuous picture of the ball is taken and the movement of the ball is analyzed on the software 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 Get data from the image and embed analytical data into algorithm a 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.640
 Ballistic measurement 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 It is a flow of producing the initial velocity spin launch angle which is the main data of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.100
 For 3 years, other measured values are calculated based on the measured data, and the ballistic on the 3d app 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 You can also see the simulation 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.229
 face Betis vs. gambling can record flight distance and ballistic data of all shots 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 You can even know the tendency of shots 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.600
 SkyTrack is a measuring instrument manufactured by decades of research and verification, so it is always accurate 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.090
 It provides us with to your data 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.140
 Comparison tests with high precision sensors that cost millions of yen 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.630
 We have also gone through professional child testing and robot testing verification . 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.159
 It is this sky that has been finished with high popularity on the popular page to realize an unprecedented low cost. 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.569
 There are only track 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.319
 This sky track made through repeated research is a golfer who aims to score up 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.110
 It will will lead the everyone to high level players 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.220
 Reyes regression 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.220
