lot of year without perhaps being a
hundred<00:00:26.609> percent<00:00:26.670> fit<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.599> he

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
hundred percent fit and he you know he

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
hundred percent fit and he you know he
did<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.019> well<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> club<00:00:28.710> before

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.349 
did really well for the club before
Christmas<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.699> needed<00:00:30.000> him<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.300> on

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Christmas when we needed him to get on

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.540 
Christmas when we needed him to get on
the<00:00:30.449> park<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.650> missed<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> big<00:00:32.160> chunk<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the park and then missed a big chunk in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.040 
the park and then missed a big chunk in
the<00:00:32.610> second<00:00:32.940> half<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> season<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.809> when

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the second half of the season so when

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299 
the second half of the season so when
you<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.230> look<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.649> where<00:00:34.829> he's<00:00:35.010> been<00:00:35.190> at

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you actually look up where he's been at

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
you actually look up where he's been at
recently<00:00:35.940> he's<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.540> played<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> lot<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.020> games

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
recently he's not played a lot of games

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
recently he's not played a lot of games
and<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.340> no<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and it would do no one any good for that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.229 
and it would do no one any good for that
situation<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.530> continue<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.969> for

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
situation to continue so I think for

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
situation to continue so I think for
Adams<00:00:42.780> benefit<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.010> wasn't<00:00:44.280> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
Adams benefit really if he wasn't going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
Adams benefit really if he wasn't going
to<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> starting<00:00:44.850> eleven<00:00:45.059> regularly

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to be in the starting eleven regularly

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
to be in the starting eleven regularly
it<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:46.860> any<00:00:46.980> other

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it was to see if there's any other

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
it was to see if there's any other
options<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.600> situation<00:00:49.320> bristol<00:00:49.649> rovers

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
then we can reassess it at the end of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
then we can reassess it at the end of
the<00:01:14.130> line<00:01:14.280> score<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.750> Jaden<00:01:16.110> stop<00:01:16.320> me<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the line score and that Jaden stop me to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.700 
the line score and that Jaden stop me to
come<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.060> yeah<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.500> knew

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
come in yeah just really because we knew

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
come in yeah just really because we knew
probably<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.310> Adam<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.000> out

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
probably that Adam was going to go out

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
probably that Adam was going to go out
and<00:01:21.360> Jaden's<00:01:22.320> apply<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> we've<00:01:22.890> known<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and Jaden's apply that we've known for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
and Jaden's apply that we've known for
quite<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.850> while<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.299> saw<00:01:24.540> him<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.500> he

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
quite a while I saw him first I think he

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.810 
quite a while I saw him first I think he
played<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.799> FA<00:01:26.009> Youth<00:01:26.189> Cup<00:01:26.220> game<00:01:26.610> for
