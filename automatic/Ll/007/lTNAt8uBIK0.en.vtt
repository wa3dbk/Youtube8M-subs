00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello to all then today a video that in 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.709
 reality takes up an idea of this summer 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 where I showed you that I was using 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.360
 the long lasting mainly of the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 kiko those in brownish colors 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.910
 brusati there so not many in the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.550
 kind of quick touch that I did 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 in the summer as I went this morning 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.869
 to do what I do instead during 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.179
 this period in which change we say i 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 colors, however, remains almost that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.930
 I change only a few little things in the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.720
 drawing on the eye 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.449
 but my main color of this 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.239
 period and the gray I love is hard 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.129
 I love touching myself with grays or one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.220
 of my favorite palette of the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.619
 smoc who is one of the cargo that is all 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.890
 on various shades of gray and is 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:55.049
 They are beautiful and I love it 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.540
 just different pencils from silver to 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.909
 gray to darker gray that I use 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.010
 very often when, in short, today 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.439
 did not put anything on the eyes or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.540
 just a gray pencil for the note 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.800
 that moment even with the small brush 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.480
 maybe I'll help you with the brush 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.210
 only to pull a little more up the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.040
 codeine but even more topic 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.860
 often compared to how to what 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 I do not do anything in the summer 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.480
 on the eyelid 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.800
 nothing particularly dark sometimes 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.380
 as I did today only slightly 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 in the fold with a matt brownish and then 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 the game with lipsticks as I usually do 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.860
 and with the blush then I'll show you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.230
 those that I have are five and they are 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.940
 those that then some that mine 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.080
 favorite of the past are two 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.640
 mainly two are new entries 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.400
 I show you the long lasting of the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 grain this and that but silver 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:53.790
 know that color cup still reads e 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.190
 the 0 2 and and this is it here is just one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.720
 beautiful silver very very very bright 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.330
 see effect that does 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.640
 iridescent and I really like to pull the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.980
 line is this here i need to help for 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.100
 force with a brush because it's too much 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.920
 often otherwise I think there is 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.600
 still then always put kiko 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.460
 this is no longer there and is one of the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.650
 my favorites and very often use 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.570
 also in a combo and this is therefore one 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.140
 old collection is put more than one 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.130
 year ago and the number zero 7 and this is it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 gray here that is always with a reflection 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.420
 silver but of course you see that the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.820
 urgent reflection inside but then of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.100
 base is a gunmetal gray 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.720
 this is beautiful among other things these 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.800
 but titles don't even tell me duration 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.070
 sublime and beautiful really beautiful too 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 here same thing this only manages to 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.240
 then temper it every now and then 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.830
 use directly just to make fast 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.180
 fast and then I repeat only 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.030
 to the hairline not to do too much 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.110
 often the pigtail uses a small brush 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.120
 to help me but it's beautiful and thick 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.970
 times when I want to put something 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.190
 under the eye I use the other part 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.220
 that is this green water I do it to you 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.220
 see here it is here and together I am 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.780
 fantastic shooting his torment inside 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.239
 of the eye and a little between the lashes e 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.200
 enough and the effect is very very nice 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.840
 then the other one I have had for some time is 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.790
 a pencil of the line but to the wall units 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.980
 of the debora that unfortunately has it 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.530
 removed from production for some time 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.390
 in fact these which I took this in 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.860
 gold bought at full price in short with 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.450
 a little discount as I wrote to water 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.640
 and soap when they decided to 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 he didn't put them away 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.849
 discount and I am present 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.159
 our colors that interested me and 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.329
 it is this mat color and it is this gray 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:48.299
 top beautiful excellent excellent durability 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.189
 optimized layout in everything excellent 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.019
 I don't understand why once you don't 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.670
 truly deceived those products 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.269
 of the debora have decided nicely 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.000
 but to remove them the same thing this 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.340
 I use it by tempering it 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.680
 line a little bit thicker and what 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.930
 I said before is also true for him 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.150
 then there are two new products that me 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.639
 they were both given away the first ed 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.680
 I think that ethical and of the collection 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:19.739
 that the last exit I can't remember 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.690
 the name the number is 0 9 this here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.520
 and this is precisely a gray pencil 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.250
 of those type automatic if you turn 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.099
 therefore under the matitone 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.220
 here too I help myself with a nib and 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.560
 behind there is a smudge then this one 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.530
 use mainly I have to tell the truth 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.430
 all over the eyelid because it is fading 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.659
 with the finger more than with that because the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.889
 color here is very glittery and 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:50.810
 honestly does not have a great deal to 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:54.570
 this unlike the estate 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.270
 really very very low so 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.860
 I tend to put it on and then blend it with the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.080
 ie finger you see that when it fades 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.810
 fathers to almost everything remains only one 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.639
 bit of silver flakes and therefore I tend to 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.300
 put it all over the eyelid los 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.460
 smoke with your finger and then intensify 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.720
 a little at the hairline 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.690
 color with the pencil I am using it myself 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.129
 they gave it to me so I'm using it 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.419
 the friend that apple 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.669
 given to me as a gift 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.239
 she didn't feel good so it's not 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.800
 that I'm denigrating a gift of my own 

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.519
 for this reason, in short, he has it 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.199
 given 

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:32.569
 and I must say that I must confirm that 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.449
 that he told me, that is not November 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.279
 also I repeat however it doesn't have a good one 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.899
 kept nothing during the day 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.399
 what to see with some of the first ones as I have 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:42.769
 absolutely seen 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.110
 I don't know the other colors because I don't know 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:48.139
 not even what colors I have seen it 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.479
 up close to the collection but not one 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.529
 what sublime this what I instead 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.800
 loved it and that's what 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.929
 use even today is a stage never ever 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.169
 the watch to pieces in the sky of the 

00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:01.399
 essence which I believe is also me 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.439
 it was not a gift 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.959
 updated on the outputs of s 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.509
 be it from the new collection of 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:11.589
 essence ie the new products that they are 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:15.019
 come out anyway the 0 4 gorgeous her 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:17.300
 written here on the barcode as like 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:20.449
 usual on this gift of mine 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.550
 friend rita and color is what i am 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.259
 see today on the eyes and this is it 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.639
 gray slightly satin this here 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.289
 you see this is much more heated like 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.110
 silver reflection this one instead 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.689
 it remains a satin finish box and that's what 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.819
 that I wear today so I pulled only 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.439
 a line with with this one i used 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.899
 directly the pencil and then I have 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.789
 only use a brush for it 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:44.749
 pull codeine a little on the hill 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.259
 eye in the end at the end 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:54.349
 eye to say look look at 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:56.779
 then look at this and this 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.789
 my favorites are those 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.999
 that in short I find myself taking 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:05.419
 quietly these two alternating 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:07.879
 with the matt one the silver one 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.369
 use especially when then dark purpose 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.110
 more, in short, however, I do 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.120
 like usable I also put it of 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.979
 day 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.380
 obviously not a swipe of this 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.199
 way but much more fine than by itself a 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.419
 bit of brightness from the eye this here 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:26.440
 I must say it is a great disappointment 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:31.630
 this no they write where you are I do not see you 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.580
 here they are, this is not sincerely not 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.590
 advice at least for the use that 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.270
 I make these pencils then in 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.020
 other cases we will not know based on makeup 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:43.690
 however, this flickering of ballets remains 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.070
 nor that they are definitely not the best 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.750
 of life 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.510
 so this is what i do in 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.280
 this period with the titles you have 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.710
 since nothing 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.810
 meanwhile so to share a new one 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.300
 autumn part of my change of 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.979
 color of pencils this point us there 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.979
 see you at the maxi hello
