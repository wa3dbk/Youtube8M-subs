I<00:01:58.820> think<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.229> silver<00:02:01.229> bullion<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:02.159> actually

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
I think of silver bullion are actually

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.999 
I think of silver bullion are actually
the<00:02:02.670> premium<00:02:03.030> silver<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.659> lot<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the premium silver a lot like I think of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.589 
the premium silver a lot like I think of
the<00:02:05.340> price<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> gas<00:02:06.740> okay<00:02:07.849> it's<00:02:08.849> basically<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the price of gas okay it's basically the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.360

the the price of the bullion is very

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.990 
the the price of the bullion is very
sticky

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
sticky

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600

as you think you are alright guys just a
quick<00:05:30.460> one<00:05:30.820> I<00:05:31.450> don't<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.230> coin<00:05:32.410> shops

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.220 
quick one I don't think the coin shops
are<00:05:32.890> out<00:05:33.010> of<00:05:33.100> 90%<00:05:33.370> like<00:05:34.030> everybody's<00:05:34.660> saying<00:05:34.900> I
