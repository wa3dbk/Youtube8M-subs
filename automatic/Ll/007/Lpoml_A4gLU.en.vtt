other reviewers on Amazon all seem to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
other reviewers on Amazon all seem to
know<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.719> thermal<00:01:04.379> detectors<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.220> how

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
know all about thermal detectors and how

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.200 
know all about thermal detectors and how
to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.820> them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to use them

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
to use them
I<00:01:06.240> doubt<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.260> reviewers<00:01:07.619> even

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I doubt that the other reviewers even

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.190 
I doubt that the other reviewers even
needed<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> read<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> manual<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.420> I'm

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
needed to read the manual and I'm

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
needed to read the manual and I'm
probably<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.640> league<00:01:12.030> here

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
probably a little out of my league here

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
probably a little out of my league here
I'll<00:01:12.479> admit<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.979> bought<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I'll admit it but when I bought this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
I'll admit it but when I bought this
thing<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.240> didn't<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> clue<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> was

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
thing I didn't have a clue what it was

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
thing I didn't have a clue what it was
or<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.310> worked<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.000> after<00:01:18.869> reading<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
or how it worked and after reading the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.140 
or how it worked and after reading the
instructions<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.159> no<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.670> idea<00:01:20.700> how<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
instructions I had no more idea how to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.969 
instructions I had no more idea how to
use<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.659> before<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> opened<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> box

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
use it than before I opened the box

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
use it than before I opened the box
luckily<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.000> thermal<00:01:24.330> detector<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
luckily the thermal detector is not a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
luckily the thermal detector is not a
particularly<00:01:25.830> difficult<00:01:26.250> instrument<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
particularly difficult instrument to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.719 
particularly difficult instrument to
figure<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.860> after<00:01:28.860> flying<00:01:29.070> blind<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
figure out after flying blind with it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
figure out after flying blind with it
for<00:01:29.970> 30<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.360> 40<00:01:30.479> minutes<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> gist<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
for 30 or 40 minutes I had the gist of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
for 30 or 40 minutes I had the gist of
how<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> works<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.850> able<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.360> some

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
how it works and was able to make some

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
how it works and was able to make some
basic<00:01:33.840> assumptions<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:34.950> how<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> best<00:01:35.579> use

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
basic assumptions about how to best use

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.390 
basic assumptions about how to best use
it<00:01:37.909> okay<00:01:38.909> here's<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.360> take<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.860> Black<00:01:41.159> &amp;

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it okay here's my take on it the Black &amp;

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.700 
it okay here's my take on it the Black &amp;
Decker<00:01:41.579> thermal<00:01:42.150> detector<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> basically<00:01:43.530> a

Decker thermal detector is basically a
