a unique type of up fly this is a
barbell<00:00:16.560> playful<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.730> order<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.060> do

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
barbell playful and now in order to do

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
barbell playful and now in order to do
this<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.350> need<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> special<00:00:19.890> kind<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
this one you will need a special kind of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
this one you will need a special kind of
garbo<00:00:20.430> plate<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.289> specifically<00:00:23.480> they<00:00:24.480> wanted

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
garbo plate and specifically they wanted

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
garbo plate and specifically they wanted
to<00:00:24.810> handle<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.949> if<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.000> one

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to handle it so if you don't have one

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
to handle it so if you don't have one
with<00:00:27.449> hands<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> head<00:00:28.680> out<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
with hands and head out I'm not just

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880 
with hands and head out I'm not just
like<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.150> then<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.260> probably<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
like so then this probably not going to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
like so then this probably not going to
work<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.610> need<00:00:32.820> something<00:00:33.270> solid<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
work for you do need something solid to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
work for you do need something solid to
grab<00:00:34.200> onto<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.219> safety's<00:00:36.000> sake

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
grab onto for this one for safety's sake

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.680 
grab onto for this one for safety's sake
now<00:00:37.340> what<00:00:38.340> you're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.149> take<00:00:39.480> two

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
now what you're going to do is take two

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440 
now what you're going to do is take two
of<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.930> plates<00:00:40.260> grip<00:00:41.219> underneath<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.820> just

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
of these plates grip underneath and just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
of these plates grip underneath and just
do<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.870> fly<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.489> majority<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> plate

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
do a fly now the majority of the plate

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
do a fly now the majority of the plate
is<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.230> hanging<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.710> putting<00:00:47.070> an

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is going to be hanging down putting an

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
is going to be hanging down putting an
extra<00:00:47.430> stretch<00:00:47.730> across<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.510> pecs<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
extra stretch across your pecs at the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040 
extra stretch across your pecs at the
bottom<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:51.090> benefit<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> one

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
bottom now the other benefit of this one

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.619 
bottom now the other benefit of this one
is<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.160> come<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.760> mass<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> plate

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
is as you come up the mass of the plate

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
is as you come up the mass of the plate
is<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.340> resting<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.430> your

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
is actually going to be resting on your

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
is actually going to be resting on your
forearm<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.930> keep<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.530> our<00:00:58.680> event

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
forearm so you keep those for our event

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
forearm so you keep those for our event
you're<00:00:59.789> actually<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.300> continuous

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you're actually going to get continuous

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
you're actually going to get continuous
tension<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> top<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tension all the way to the top of the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
tension all the way to the top of the
movement<00:01:02.760> whereas<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.329> regular<00:01:03.690> dumbbell

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
movement whereas in regular dumbbell

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
movement whereas in regular dumbbell
flyes<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.010> tend<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> lose<00:01:05.489> quite<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> lot<00:01:05.939> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
flyes you do tend to lose quite a lot of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
flyes you do tend to lose quite a lot of
that<00:01:06.119> tension<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.570> come<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> top

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that tension as you come to the top

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
that tension as you come to the top
contracted<00:01:07.710> position<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.090> solves

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
contracted position and so this solves

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
contracted position and so this solves
couple<00:01:09.750> problems<00:01:11.060> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
couple problems if you just have a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
couple problems if you just have a
couple<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.990> 45-pound<00:01:13.560> plate<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.920> obviously<00:01:14.220> we

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
couple of 45-pound plate so obviously we

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.350 
couple of 45-pound plate so obviously we
will<00:01:14.400> need<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.700> strong<00:01:14.939> enough<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> do

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
will need to be strong enough to do

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
will need to be strong enough to do
these<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> smaller<00:01:17.220> plates

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
these if you have the smaller plates

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.030 
these if you have the smaller plates
like<00:01:17.820> tens<00:01:18.090> 25<00:01:18.600> 35<00:01:19.049> s<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.710> gives<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
like tens 25 35 s that gives you a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
like tens 25 35 s that gives you a
little<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.090> I've<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.450> got

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
little you a here as well I've just got

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
little you a here as well I've just got
7<00:01:22.080> 45<00:01:22.470> s<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> can

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
7 45 s but I can

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.690 
7 45 s but I can
without<00:01:23.760> any<00:01:23.880> problems<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.430> what<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> going

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
without any problems so what you going

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.870 
without any problems so what you going
to<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:29.690> assume<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.810> end<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.140> bench<00:01:31.880> now

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to do assume the end of the bench now

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.540 
to do assume the end of the bench now
grip<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.260> towards<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> middle<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
grip them in towards the middle like

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.570 
grip them in towards the middle like
this<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> position<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:40.580> a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
this and then get in a position like a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.010 
this and then get in a position like a
kettlebell<00:01:41.970> rapping<00:01:42.420> position<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.899> you're

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
kettlebell rapping position if you're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.520 
kettlebell rapping position if you're
familiar<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:45.110> just<00:01:46.110> press<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.409> up
