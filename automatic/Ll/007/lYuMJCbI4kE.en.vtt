this<00:01:29.850> game<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> flak<00:01:30.990> jacket<00:01:31.020> pro<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this game is a flak jacket pro just so I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
this game is a flak jacket pro just so I
don't<00:01:32.610> die<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:33.180> claymores<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
don't die from my claymores that's the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.870 
don't die from my claymores that's the
main<00:01:34.259> reason<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.770> started<00:01:34.950> using<00:01:35.189> black<00:01:35.490> jacket

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
main reason I started using black jacket

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
main reason I started using black jacket
it<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.619> well<00:01:37.619> hmm<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> hate<00:01:38.640> tying<00:01:38.880> my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it was because well hmm I hate tying my

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
it was because well hmm I hate tying my
claymores<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> they're<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.350> good<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
claymores and they're really good and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.039 
claymores and they're really good and
are<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.280> hard<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> avoid<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.329> yeah

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
are like really hard to avoid so yeah

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
are like really hard to avoid so yeah
and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.560> pro<00:01:43.770> heart<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:45.270> die<00:01:45.450> by

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and the pro heart so I don't die by

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.700 
and the pro heart so I don't die by
napalm<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.350> definitely<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.950> plus<00:01:48.350> my<00:01:49.350> second

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
napalm is definitely a plus my second

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.969 
napalm is definitely a plus my second
perk<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.070> hardened<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.200> yeah<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
perk is hardened and yeah just because I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.109 
perk is hardened and yeah just because I
could<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> could<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.790> shoot<00:01:53.909> through

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
could so I could just shoot through

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.940 
could so I could just shoot through
walls<00:01:54.149> easier<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.079> especially<00:01:55.619> from

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
walls easier I'm like especially from

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
walls easier I'm like especially from
like<00:01:56.070> modern<00:01:56.310> warfare<00:01:56.460> 2<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.969> cod4<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
like modern warfare 2 and in cod4 like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
like modern warfare 2 and in cod4 like
you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.229> shoot<00:01:58.380> through<00:01:58.469> walls<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.189> much

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you can shoot through walls so much

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
you can shoot through walls so much
easier<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.659> game<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.229> game<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
easier than in this game this game it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.530 
easier than in this game this game it's
like<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.280> hard<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.149> harden

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
like really really hard but harden

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.749 
like really really hard but harden
definitely<00:02:04.049> helps<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> started<00:02:05.399> using<00:02:05.549> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
definitely helps so I started using that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.589 
definitely helps so I started using that
and<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.039> my<00:02:08.039> third<00:02:08.220> perk<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> tack<00:02:09.060> mask<00:02:09.300> pro

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
