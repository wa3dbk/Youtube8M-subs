00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.130 
it's just going to do it on its own but
this<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.910> interface<00:01:41.240> looks<00:01:41.480> really<00:01:41.810> sweet

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
when you combine it with the air it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.250 
when you combine it with the air it
actually<00:02:06.920> frees<00:02:07.460> mobs<00:02:07.760> for<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.330> 6<00:02:08.840> seconds

I'll show you these attacks except for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.920 
I'll show you these attacks except for
this<00:02:32.030> think<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:32.540> doesn't<00:02:32.720> really

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
this think of this one doesn't really

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.990 
this think of this one doesn't really
all<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.530> do<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.800> see<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.250> move<00:02:34.370> past<00:02:34.700> them

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
all I do is see I can move past them

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.990 
all I do is see I can move past them
real<00:02:35.630> quick<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.860> first<00:02:37.100> I'll<00:02:37.280> show<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.489> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.759 
real quick but first I'll show you this
one<00:02:38.060> which<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.290> deals<00:02:39.500> three<00:02:39.739> damage

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
one which that just deals three damage

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.740 
one which that just deals three damage
it<00:02:40.250> won't<00:02:40.400> freeze<00:02:40.550> them<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.060> think<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.690> will

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it won't freeze them I think it will

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.320 
it won't freeze them I think it will
freeze<00:02:41.989> them<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.590> very<00:02:42.890> short<00:02:42.950> duration

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
freeze them for a very short duration

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.050 
freeze them for a very short duration
nothing<00:02:44.330> too<00:02:44.510> long<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.489> combine<00:02:46.700> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
nothing too long but if I combine that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.150 
nothing too long but if I combine that
with<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.330> air<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.200> should<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.410> frozen<00:02:48.709> for

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
with the air one it should be frozen for

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.770 
with the air one it should be frozen for
six<00:02:49.400> seconds<00:02:49.820> now<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.450> get<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.180 
okay so I just straight barbecue to his
ass<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:32.270> really<00:03:32.780> love<00:03:32.960> these<00:03:33.140> magic<00:03:33.590> spells<00:03:33.860> but

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
ass I really love these magic spells but

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.440 
ass I really love these magic spells but
I<00:03:34.340> think<00:03:34.610> they<00:03:34.670> should<00:03:34.820> add<00:03:34.910> some<00:03:35.180> magic

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
I think they should add some magic

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.660 
I think they should add some magic
potions<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.620> hope<00:03:36.770> they<00:03:36.920> add<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.550> some

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
potions and I hope they add in some

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.760 
potions and I hope they add in some
items<00:03:38.030> like<00:03:38.120> give<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.570> magic<00:03:38.990> bonuses

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
items like give you like magic bonuses

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.980 
items like give you like magic bonuses
and<00:03:40.010> effects<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.180> stuff<00:03:41.300> like<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.810> think

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
and effects and stuff like that I think

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.840 
and effects and stuff like that I think
that'd<00:03:42.290> be<00:03:42.440> pretty<00:03:42.680> sweet<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:43.550> mean<00:03:43.760> that's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
that'd be pretty sweet but I mean that's

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.670 
that'd be pretty sweet but I mean that's
why<00:03:44.030> it's<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> work<00:03:44.330> in<00:03:44.480> progress

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
why it's a work in progress

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.550 
why it's a work in progress
so<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.730> could<00:03:46.910> combine<00:03:47.090> other<00:03:47.450> spells<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.080> I'm

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
so I could combine other spells so I'm

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.470 
so I could combine other spells so I'm
spawning<00:03:48.890> another<00:03:49.280> zombie<00:03:49.520> I'll<00:03:49.850> do<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.270> fire

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
spawning another zombie I'll do the fire

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.170 
spawning another zombie I'll do the fire
and<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.960> that<00:03:51.770> is<00:03:51.950> lethal<00:03:52.220> right<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.910> it's

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
and that that is lethal right there it's

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.590 
and that that is lethal right there it's
the<00:03:53.420> spikes<00:03:53.780> plus<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:54.680> lights<00:03:55.390> zombie<00:03:56.390> on

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
the spikes plus it's lights zombie on

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.790 
the spikes plus it's lights zombie on
fire<00:03:56.960> I<00:03:57.710> could<00:03:58.550> do<00:03:59.200> let<00:04:00.200> me<00:04:00.320> see<00:04:00.500> what<00:04:00.650> happens

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
fire I could do let me see what happens

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.930 
fire I could do let me see what happens
when<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:02.860> let<00:04:03.860> me<00:04:03.980> just<00:04:04.160> do<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.310> spikes<00:04:04.610> there

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
when you let me just do the spikes there

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.330 
when you let me just do the spikes there
okay<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:05.930> another<00:04:06.230> one<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.470> could<00:04:06.680> combine<00:04:06.860> is

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
okay so another one I could combine is

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.700 
okay so another one I could combine is
the<00:04:07.520> spikes<00:04:07.820> with<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.240> frozen<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.870> he'll<00:04:09.560> be

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
the spikes with the frozen and he'll be

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.170 
the spikes with the frozen and he'll be
stuck<00:04:10.010> for<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.250> really<00:04:10.460> long<00:04:10.610> time<00:04:10.670> he's<00:04:11.060> not

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
stuck for a really long time he's not

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.820 
stuck for a really long time he's not
taking<00:04:11.450> any<00:04:11.540> damage<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.080> he's<00:04:12.290> stuck<00:04:12.590> for<00:04:12.770> I

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
taking any damage but he's stuck for I

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.190 
taking any damage but he's stuck for I
think<00:04:12.890> longer<00:04:13.340> than<00:04:13.610> six<00:04:13.940> seconds<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:14.720> mean

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
think longer than six seconds so I mean

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.990 
think longer than six seconds so I mean
you<00:04:15.410> get<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.800> bunch<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.160> hits<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:16.520> on<00:04:16.640> him<00:04:16.820> by

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
you get in a bunch of hits in on him by

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.900 
you get in a bunch of hits in on him by
time<00:04:17.209> he's<00:04:17.390> free<00:04:18.170> uh<00:04:18.440> I'm<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.370> finishing<00:04:19.760> with

some so fire blight am on fire I don't

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.540 
some so fire blight am on fire I don't
know<00:04:24.530> if<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> could<00:04:24.830> mix<00:04:25.010> anything<00:04:25.370> out<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
know if you could mix anything out that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.340 
know if you could mix anything out that
like<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.090> said<00:04:26.180> that'll<00:04:26.600> just<00:04:26.750> freeze<00:04:26.990> him<00:04:27.020> for

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
like I said that'll just freeze him for

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.230 
like I said that'll just freeze him for
six<00:04:27.560> seconds<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.520> wonder<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.030> could<00:04:29.120> do

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
six seconds I wonder if you could do

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.920 
six seconds I wonder if you could do
this<00:04:29.420> with<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:30.110> oh<00:04:31.330> wow<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.690> it's

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
this with that oh wow it's like it's

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.390 
this with that oh wow it's like it's
like<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.080> more<00:04:33.350> powerful<00:04:33.560> one

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.770 

let<00:04:37.240> me<00:04:37.330> try<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.540> fire<00:04:37.810> one<00:04:38.020> by<00:04:38.169> itself<00:04:38.230> I

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
let me try the fire one by itself I

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
let me try the fire one by itself I
don't<00:04:40.780> know<00:04:40.840> if<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.050> actually<00:04:41.169> did<00:04:41.530> anything

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
don't know if that actually did anything

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.220 
don't know if that actually did anything
but<00:04:42.370> I<00:04:42.430> mean<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.449> wouldn't<00:04:43.720> make<00:04:43.810> sense<00:04:43.870> if

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
but I mean it it wouldn't make sense if

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.900 
but I mean it it wouldn't make sense if
you<00:04:44.320> could<00:04:44.440> do<00:04:44.560> an<00:04:44.650> ice<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.070> fire<00:04:45.250> attack<00:04:45.520> at

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
you could do an ice in a fire attack at

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.600 
you could do an ice in a fire attack at
once<00:04:46.120> but<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.720> want<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.440> try<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.710> again<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.250> won

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
once but I want to try that again I won

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.770 
once but I want to try that again I won
high<00:04:48.760> on<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.000> mountain<00:04:49.030> see<00:04:49.389> how<00:04:49.449> much<00:04:49.540> damage

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
spells you could combine and stuff I'm

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.320 
spells you could combine and stuff I'm
pretty<00:05:14.979> sure<00:05:15.190> that<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.970> near<00:05:16.150> future

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
pretty sure that in the near future

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.300 
pretty sure that in the near future
maybe<00:05:16.690> he<00:05:16.990> will<00:05:17.139> add<00:05:17.320> in<00:05:17.560> more<00:05:17.740> but<00:05:17.979> I<00:05:18.010> really

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
maybe he will add in more but I really
