00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
um I usually don't do tutorials but I've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.870 
um I usually don't do tutorials but I've
been<00:00:07.859> trying<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> figure<00:00:08.309> out<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
been trying to figure out how to do a

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.000 
been trying to figure out how to do a
three<00:00:09.090> strand<00:00:09.389> twist<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.080> finally<00:00:10.349> found<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
three strand twist and I finally found a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.740 
three strand twist and I finally found a
video<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.550> YouTube<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:13.009> I<00:00:14.120> think<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> problem

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
video on YouTube and I think the problem

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.450 
video on YouTube and I think the problem
with<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> YouTube<00:00:16.350> videos<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> people<00:00:17.310> have

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
with the YouTube videos that people have

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.130 
with the YouTube videos that people have
trouble<00:00:17.850> trying<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> figure<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.869> piece

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
trouble trying to figure out what piece

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.790 
trouble trying to figure out what piece
of<00:00:19.170> hair<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.800> layer<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.850> um<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:22.260> thought

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
of hair is one layer so um I thought

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
of hair is one layer so um I thought
doing<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.340> yarn<00:00:23.609> would<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.449> cool

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
doing it with yarn would be really cool

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.519 
doing it with yarn would be really cool
I<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.500> also<00:00:25.800> curious<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:27.109> like<00:00:28.109> even

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I was also curious to see what like even

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.689 
I was also curious to see what like even
when<00:00:28.680> you're<00:00:28.830> doing<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> don't<00:00:29.550> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
when you're doing it you don't really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
when you're doing it you don't really
know<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.210> hair<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.810> where<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.380> just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
know what hair is going where you just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
know what hair is going where you just
know<00:00:31.769> where<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> move<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.570> makes

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
know where to move it to but that makes

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
know where to move it to but that makes
sense<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.309> wanted<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> see

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
sense I don't know so I wanted to see

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.970 
sense I don't know so I wanted to see
what<00:00:36.360> each<00:00:36.600> strand<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.079> hair<00:00:37.260> looked<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.620> as

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
what each strand of hair looked like as

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.450 
what each strand of hair looked like as
it<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.610> around<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.950> three<00:00:41.160> strand

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it was going around the the three strand

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
it was going around the the three strand
twist<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.390> can't<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.379> explain<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.890> too

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
twist so I can't really explain it too

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.110 
twist so I can't really explain it too

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.229 

so<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:50.080> think<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.220> looks<00:02:51.370> really<00:02:51.670> pretty

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
so I think it looks really pretty

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.589 
so I think it looks really pretty
I<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:54.670> anyone's<00:02:55.030> gonna<00:02:55.120> wear<00:02:55.330> their<00:02:55.450> hair

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
I think anyone's gonna wear their hair

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.880 
I think anyone's gonna wear their hair
like<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:55.959> though<00:02:57.269> but<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.830> pretty<00:03:00.099> cool

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
like this though but it's pretty cool

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.600 
like this though but it's pretty cool
how<00:03:02.890> long<00:03:03.069> that's<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.580> out<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> focus<00:03:03.940> and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
how long that's going out of focus and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.970 
how long that's going out of focus and
here<00:03:06.610> we<00:03:06.760> go<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:09.099> now<00:03:09.160> these<00:03:09.640> little<00:03:09.940> bits<00:03:10.269> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
here we go and now these little bits of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.839 
here we go and now these little bits of
yarn<00:03:11.980> coming<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> end<00:03:13.330> here<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.849> think

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
yarn coming to the end here so I think

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.259 
yarn coming to the end here so I think
it's<00:03:16.120> about<00:03:16.239> time<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.380> stop<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.489> yarn<00:03:21.849> so

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
it's about time to stop this is yarn so

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.740 
it's about time to stop this is yarn so
a<00:03:22.299> natural<00:03:22.690> hair<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:24.519> know<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.480> stop

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
a natural hair you know I can I can stop

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.240 
a natural hair you know I can I can stop
with<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.110> yarn<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.799> not<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
with this yarn and it's not going to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.990 
with this yarn and it's not going to
completely<00:03:27.610> unravel<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:30.160> can't<00:03:30.640> tell<00:03:30.849> you

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
completely unravel so I can't tell you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.380 
completely unravel so I can't tell you
for<00:03:31.030> sure<00:03:31.239> what<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.780> does<00:03:32.019> on<00:03:33.120> natural<00:03:34.120> hair

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
for sure what it does on natural hair

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:46.420 
for sure what it does on natural hair
but<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.040> what<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.310> does<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> yarn

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.059 

but<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:47.520> pretty<00:03:47.730> sure<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.620> your<00:03:49.620> natural

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
but I'm pretty sure that your natural

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.370 
but I'm pretty sure that your natural
hair<00:03:50.280> will<00:03:50.610> keep<00:03:51.330> these<00:03:51.630> ends<00:03:52.170> intact<00:03:54.380> when

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
hair will keep these ends intact when

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.729 
hair will keep these ends intact when
you're<00:03:55.530> done<00:03:56.930> doing<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.140> twist<00:03:58.410> all<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.680> way

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
you're done doing the twist all the way

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.199 
you're done doing the twist all the way
to<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:59.010> end<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:03.000> three

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
to the end and that's it that's a three

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.780 
to the end and that's it that's a three
strand<00:04:03.510> twist
