the<00:02:23.720> underside<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> lid<00:02:24.470> what<00:02:25.400> looks<00:02:25.640> here

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
the underside of the lid what looks here

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.670 
the underside of the lid what looks here
probably<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> camera<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:26.989> fuzzy<00:02:27.440> mold

probably on the camera like fuzzy mold

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.300 
probably on the camera like fuzzy mold
is<00:02:27.890> actually<00:02:28.400> ice<00:02:28.610> crystals<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.920> keep<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
is actually ice crystals so keep it

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.580 
is actually ice crystals so keep it
right<00:02:32.090> under<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.660> bottom<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.319> freezer

right under the bottom of the freezer

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.720 
right under the bottom of the freezer
and<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:36.170> cold<00:02:36.410> enough<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.709> ice<00:02:37.130> forms<00:02:37.579> on

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and it's cold enough that ice forms on

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.750 
and it's cold enough that ice forms on
the<00:02:37.819> inside<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.299> lid<00:02:39.280> keeps<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> kimchi

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the inside of the lid keeps the kimchi

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
eat kimchi now what I am doing by aging

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.110 
eat kimchi now what I am doing by aging
at<00:03:13.579> my<00:03:13.730> mom<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.150> my<00:03:15.160> refrigerator<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:16.970> gets

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
at my mom and my refrigerator so it gets

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.680 
at my mom and my refrigerator so it gets
soured<00:03:17.599> so<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.170> called<00:03:18.410> lacto<00:03:18.889> fermentation

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
soured so it's called lacto fermentation

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.599 
soured so it's called lacto fermentation
I'll<00:03:20.690> let<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.079> look<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.530> up<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.950> Wikipedia

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
I'll let you look that up on Wikipedia

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.589 
I'll let you look that up on Wikipedia
or<00:03:22.819> wherever<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.239> want<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:24.370> basically<00:03:25.599> it

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
or wherever you want and basically it

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.020 
or wherever you want and basically it
preserves<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.519> cabbage<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.669> that<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.880> doesn't

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
preserves the cabbage so that it doesn't

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.699 
preserves the cabbage so that it doesn't
rot<00:03:29.419> and<00:03:31.569> but<00:03:32.569> it's<00:03:32.690> basically<00:03:32.870> winter<00:03:33.470> kimchi

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
rot and but it's basically winter kimchi

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.620 
rot and but it's basically winter kimchi
of<00:03:34.220> course<00:03:34.459> now<00:03:34.669> that<00:03:34.700> we<00:03:34.880> got<00:03:34.910> refrigerators

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
of course now that we got refrigerators

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.080 
of course now that we got refrigerators
you<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.900> have<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.169> all<00:03:36.230> year<00:03:36.530> round

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
you can have it all year round

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.680 
you can have it all year round
traditionally<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.349> Korea<00:03:40.389> kimchi<00:03:41.389> would<00:03:41.540> be

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
traditionally in Korea kimchi would be

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.839 
traditionally in Korea kimchi would be
put<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:41.989> earthen<00:03:42.349> vessels<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.040> buried<00:03:43.639> under

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
put in earthen vessels and buried under

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.640 
put in earthen vessels and buried under
the<00:03:43.940> ground<00:03:44.150> throughout<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.139> winter<00:03:45.260> to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the ground throughout the winter to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.300 
the ground throughout the winter to
preserve<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:48.260> burying<00:03:49.010> under<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
preserve it and the burying under the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.309 
preserve it and the burying under the
ground<00:03:49.459> will<00:03:49.639> keep<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.940> from<00:03:50.090> freezing<00:03:50.319> but

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
ground will keep it from freezing but

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.189 
ground will keep it from freezing but
would<00:03:51.590> also<00:03:52.090> keep<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.269> very<00:03:53.419> very<00:03:53.690> cold<00:03:53.959> and

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
would also keep it very very cold and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.910 
would also keep it very very cold and
then<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.500> would<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.799> able<00:03:54.979> to<00:03:55.160> eat<00:03:55.250> kimchi

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
then you would be able to eat kimchi

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.580 
then you would be able to eat kimchi
well<00:03:57.130> basically<00:03:58.080> through<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.170> winter<00:03:59.440> months

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
well basically through the winter months

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.180 
well basically through the winter months
at<00:03:59.830> least<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.330> i<00:04:01.380> guess<00:04:02.380> some<00:04:02.410> went<00:04:02.830> into<00:04:03.069> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
at least and i guess some went into the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.180 
at least and i guess some went into the
springtime<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:03.940> long<00:04:04.840> as<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.560> stays<00:04:05.680> buried

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
springtime as long as it stays buried

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.309 
springtime as long as it stays buried
under<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.550> ground<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:06.880> stays<00:04:07.239> cold<00:04:07.569> at

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
under the ground that stays cold at

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.050 
under the ground that stays cold at
least<00:04:08.500> until<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.980> ground<00:04:09.130> thaws<00:04:09.459> out<00:04:09.780> so

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
least until the ground thaws out so

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.510 
least until the ground thaws out so
there<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:14.620> kimchi<00:04:14.890> lesson<00:04:15.400> from

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
there it is a little kimchi lesson from

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.950 
there it is a little kimchi lesson from
the<00:04:15.640> kimchi<00:04:16.000> man<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.329> non<00:04:16.930> kimchi<00:04:17.500> expert
