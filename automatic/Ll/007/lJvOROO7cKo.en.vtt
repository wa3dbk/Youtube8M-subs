00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
see our f250 and it looks like virtually

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.270 
see our f250 and it looks like virtually
the<00:01:19.880> same<00:01:19.910> bike<00:01:20.360> because<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.440> there's

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280

nothing wrong with a bike obviously it's

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.110

winning races and winning Supercross and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.390 
winning races and winning Supercross and
I<00:01:26.180> don't<00:01:26.240> know<00:01:26.690> why<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.350> make<00:01:27.650> big<00:01:27.860> changes<00:01:28.190> to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
I don't know why I make big changes to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.830 
I don't know why I make big changes to
it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.870 
it
biggest<00:01:29.840> change<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.080> they<00:01:30.290> made<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
biggest change that they made is the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.520 
biggest change that they made is the
forks<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.450> shock<00:01:32.720> have<00:01:32.990> been<00:01:33.110> stiffened

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
forks and the shock have been stiffened

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.550 
forks and the shock have been stiffened
up<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.800> little<00:01:33.950> bit<00:01:34.160> just<00:01:34.540> with<00:01:35.540> stiffer<00:01:35.810> rate

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
up a little bit just with stiffer rate

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.580 
up a little bit just with stiffer rate
Springs<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.690> was<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> big<00:01:39.140> improvement

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
Springs and that was a big improvement

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.070 
Springs and that was a big improvement
because<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.520> bailed<00:01:40.970> on<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:41.300> laughing<00:01:41.630> like

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
because I bailed on you laughing like

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.930 
because I bailed on you laughing like
it's<00:01:42.650> kind<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.010> you<00:01:43.100> go<00:01:43.250> into<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.490> corner<00:01:43.910> and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
it's kind of you go into a corner and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.020 
it's kind of you go into a corner and
the<00:01:44.150> thing<00:01:44.330> sacks<00:01:44.690> out<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:46.610> kind<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.910> takes

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
the thing sacks out and it kind of takes

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.180 
the thing sacks out and it kind of takes
all<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.420> momentum<00:01:47.660> away<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.410> now<00:01:48.860> it's<00:01:49.100> a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
all the momentum away so now it's a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.440 
all the momentum away so now it's a
little<00:01:49.220> bit<00:01:49.460> stiffer<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.030> kind<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.210> rides

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
little bit stiffer and it kind of rides

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.640 
little bit stiffer and it kind of rides
through<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.720> corner<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.050> lot<00:01:51.200> smoother<00:01:51.560> and

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
through the corner a lot smoother and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.260 
through the corner a lot smoother and
gets<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.100> through<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.430> with<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.000> know<00:01:53.120> in

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
gets it through there with you know in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.380 
gets it through there with you know in
one<00:01:53.479> motion<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.229> doesn't<00:01:55.190> have<00:01:55.370> that<00:01:55.430> give<00:01:55.970> to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
one motion and doesn't have that give to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.390 
one motion and doesn't have that give to
where<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.200> lose<00:01:57.350> all<00:01:57.500> your<00:01:57.590> power<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.160> that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
where you lose all your power so that

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.700 
where you lose all your power so that
was<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> big<00:01:59.150> improvement<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.840> smart<00:02:00.590> on

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
was a big improvement and smart on

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.130 
was a big improvement and smart on
Honda's<00:02:01.070> part<00:02:01.460> they<00:02:02.180> also<00:02:02.330> made<00:02:02.660> some

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
Honda's part they also made some

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.540 
Honda's part they also made some
adjustments<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.070> fuel<00:02:04.250> injection

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
adjustments to the fuel injection

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.640 
adjustments to the fuel injection
settings<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.510> kind<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.350> gave<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.620> a

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
settings that kind of just gave it a

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.440 
settings that kind of just gave it a
little<00:02:06.680> bit<00:02:06.890> more<00:02:07.010> hit<00:02:07.160> off<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.430> bottom<00:02:07.790> which

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
little bit more hit off the bottom which

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.570 
little bit more hit off the bottom which
I<00:02:08.780> immediately<00:02:09.170> felt<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.190> mean<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.490> was

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
I immediately felt and I mean that was

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.610 
I immediately felt and I mean that was
big<00:02:10.760> -<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.120> gets<00:02:11.450> out<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.750> like<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.200> said<00:02:12.260> it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
big - it gets out of like I said it

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.990 
big - it gets out of like I said it
works<00:02:12.770> with<00:02:12.980> suspension<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.700> gets<00:02:13.820> out<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
works with suspension it gets out of the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.190 
works with suspension it gets out of the
corners<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.420> bit<00:02:14.600> better<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.840> little<00:02:14.959> bit

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
corners a little bit better a little bit

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080 
corners a little bit better a little bit
quicker<00:02:15.380> helps<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.280> get<00:02:16.370> over<00:02:16.550> those<00:02:16.670> jumps

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
quicker helps you get over those jumps

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.520 
quicker helps you get over those jumps
