 Preparing a proper borsch takes time. But the effort is worth it. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 The borscht starts with the broth. Fry the meat and bones in the oven, pour into a pot of water and bring to a boil over low heat. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Then add the onions, the carrot, the garlic and a bunch of herbs and spices. Simmer for 2-3 hours over medium heat to bring out the flavor. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 That's enough time to prepare all the other ingredients. Roast or cook the unpeeled red beets for 30-40 minutes. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.133
 Cut the cabbage, the onions and potatoes, grate the carrots. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Strain the broth and remove the meat from the bones. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 The cabbage comes first. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Fry the onions and carrots until they are soft and light brown. A strong and intense aroma fills the air. Add the onions and carrots to the broth, along with the potatoes. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 The beetroot stewed. A dash of lemon juice helps to preserve the strong redness of the borsch, a spoonful of tomato paste will bind the aroma of the soup. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 After adding the red beets, cook the soup for another 15-20 minutes. Add the garlic before removing the borsch from the plate. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Everything will be a little better if the soup stops for a day. Or at least 2-3 hours.
