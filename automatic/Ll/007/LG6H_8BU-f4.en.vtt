you<00:00:01.760> might<00:00:01.940> be<00:00:02.060> wondering<00:00:02.300> whether<00:00:02.720> there<00:00:03.020> are

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.050 
you might be wondering whether there are

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.869 
you might be wondering whether there are
any<00:00:03.139> factors<00:00:03.739> that<00:00:03.979> might<00:00:04.130> make<00:00:04.340> someone<00:00:04.520> more

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:04.879 
any factors that might make someone more

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.119 
any factors that might make someone more
or<00:00:05.089> less<00:00:05.270> likely<00:00:05.540> to<00:00:05.750> conform<00:00:06.109> or<00:00:06.890> the

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:07.129 
or less likely to conform or the

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.440 
or less likely to conform or the
likelihood<00:00:07.609> that<00:00:07.640> they<00:00:07.790> will<00:00:07.939> adjust<00:00:08.029> their

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
likelihood that they will adjust their

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.940 
likelihood that they will adjust their
behaviors<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.050> thinking<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:09.559> go<00:00:09.679> along<00:00:09.920> with

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
behaviors and thinking to go along with

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.209 
behaviors and thinking to go along with
a<00:00:10.099> group<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:10.809> there<00:00:11.809> certainly<00:00:11.990> are<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.650> I

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
a group and there certainly are and I

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.680 
a group and there certainly are and I
won't<00:00:13.460> go<00:00:13.580> over<00:00:13.730> all<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:13.940> them<00:00:14.150> in<00:00:14.330> this<00:00:14.450> video

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
won't go over all of them in this video

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.390 
won't go over all of them in this video
I<00:00:14.929> do<00:00:15.290> want<00:00:15.530> to<00:00:15.559> give<00:00:15.710> you<00:00:15.769> a<00:00:15.860> pretty<00:00:16.010> wider

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
I do want to give you a pretty wider

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.550 
I do want to give you a pretty wider
diverse<00:00:16.790> variety<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:17.869> can<00:00:18.020> see<00:00:18.170> just<00:00:18.439> how

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
diverse variety so you can see just how

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.560 
diverse variety so you can see just how
much<00:00:19.010> of<00:00:19.189> this<00:00:19.310> behavior<00:00:19.820> can<00:00:20.029> be<00:00:20.060> dependent

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
much of this behavior can be dependent

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.660 
much of this behavior can be dependent
upon<00:00:20.660> external<00:00:20.779> factors<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:22.160> otherwise

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
upon external factors that otherwise

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.400 
upon external factors that otherwise
might<00:00:22.970> have<00:00:23.029> nothing<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.750> do<00:00:23.900> with<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.080> person

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
might have nothing to do with the person

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.490 
might have nothing to do with the person
themselves<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:26.720> first<00:00:26.960> factor<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:27.349> want

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
themselves and the first factor I want

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.070 
themselves and the first factor I want
to<00:00:27.619> talk<00:00:27.769> about<00:00:27.890> is<00:00:28.070> group<00:00:28.310> size<00:00:29.080> specifically

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
to talk about is group size specifically

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.990 
to talk about is group size specifically
people<00:00:30.529> seem<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.830> be<00:00:30.920> more<00:00:31.189> likely<00:00:31.429> to<00:00:31.640> conform

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
people seem to be more likely to conform

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.930 
people seem to be more likely to conform
when<00:00:32.270> they're<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.480> groups<00:00:32.509> of<00:00:32.840> three<00:00:33.080> to<00:00:33.110> five

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
when they're in groups of three to five

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.610 
when they're in groups of three to five
we<00:00:34.940> are<00:00:35.060> also<00:00:35.240> more<00:00:35.630> likely<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:36.020> conform<00:00:36.350> when

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
we are also more likely to conform when

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.890 
we are also more likely to conform when
the<00:00:36.680> opinion<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.220> group<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.490> unanimous<00:00:38.000> or

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
the opinion of the group is unanimous or

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.300 
the opinion of the group is unanimous or
when<00:00:39.020> everyone<00:00:39.380> in<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.500> group<00:00:39.650> agrees<00:00:39.980> upon<00:00:40.280> a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
when everyone in the group agrees upon a

researchers change the experiment such
that<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> participant<00:00:49.610> had<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.790> supporter

someone<00:00:51.590> who<00:00:51.710> gave<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.130> correct<00:00:52.460> answer

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
someone who gave the correct answer

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.430 
someone who gave the correct answer
before<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.270> was<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> participants<00:00:54.140> turn<00:00:54.260> to

trial total compliance dropped to only

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.950 
trial total compliance dropped to only
5%<00:01:10.220> when<00:01:11.030> there<00:01:11.180> was<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.300> supporter<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:11.930> the

5% when there was a supporter in the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.380 
5% when there was a supporter in the
group<00:01:12.670> when<00:01:13.670> they<00:01:13.760> asked<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> participants

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
group when they asked the participants

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.090 
group when they asked the participants
whether<00:01:14.900> or<00:01:15.110> not<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.470> presence<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.950> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
whether or not the presence of that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.680 
whether or not the presence of that
defector<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:16.670> any<00:01:16.850> way<00:01:17.030> influenced<00:01:17.570> their

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
defector in any way influenced their

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.460 
defector in any way influenced their
responses<00:01:18.320> they<00:01:19.070> claimed<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.580> they<00:01:19.820> didn't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
responses they claimed that they didn't

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.990 
responses they claimed that they didn't
so<00:01:21.470> all<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.740> research<00:01:22.040> does<00:01:22.370> show<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.700> the

so all the research does show that the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.850 
so all the research does show that the
presence<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.570> defector<00:01:23.990> influences<00:01:24.680> how

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
presence of a defector influences how

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.250 
presence of a defector influences how

breakfast and taken together all of this

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.920 
breakfast and taken together all of this
helps<00:07:03.189> to<00:07:03.309> describe<00:07:03.699> why<00:07:03.909> perfectly<00:07:04.509> ordinary

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.059 
could cause others to not conform as
well<00:07:21.809> it<00:07:22.809> made<00:07:23.020> me<00:07:23.139> consider<00:07:23.469> the<00:07:23.649> fact<00:07:23.860> that

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:24.069 
well it made me consider the fact that

I<00:07:26.289> could<00:07:26.680> have<00:07:26.800> a<00:07:26.830> strong<00:07:27.159> influence<00:07:27.490> on

I could have a strong influence on

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.089 
I could have a strong influence on

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099 
others and I find a lot of comfort and

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.029 
others and I find a lot of comfort and
strengthen<00:07:30.550> that<00:07:30.699> idea<00:07:31.029> I<00:07:31.469> can<00:07:32.469> also<00:07:32.619> take<00:07:32.889> the

strengthen that idea I can also take the
