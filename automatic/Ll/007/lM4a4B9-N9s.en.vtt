 [Music] 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.520
 The court reporters were on their way again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
 in the past week to the harvest of 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.430
 Barley and rape on the domain 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.200
 salt dahlum the verbund plant with 420 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 Hektar area is located in WolfenbÃ¼ttel 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.599
 twelve kilometers southeast of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 Brunswick combine driver Andreas 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.739
 Faber pulls his tracks 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.329
 them is holding an automatic steering system 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:35.040
 on course controlled via gps that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.100
 The cutting unit of the thresher is ten meters 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.240
 50 wide is threshes 40 to 60 tons 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.320
 barley per hour 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.150
 manager johannes weber comes 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 He wants to go after the losses 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.130
 look and a rehearsal for the measurement 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 to get the moisture 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.180
 He has 65 hectares of winter barley in this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 year grown bigger problems with the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.570
 culture did not exist so far 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 which of course is a big problem 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.310
 is like a rail this year is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.450
 Just the wet to harvest when for the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.939
 harvester not even so through 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.290
 we have the tape drive there relatively 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.079
 little problems with my things 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.520
 However, the departure with the 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.109
 is keychains receiving drescher ago 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.719
 even with fully loaded trailers already 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.240
 problems the soil structure may be underneath 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:22.499
 If possible, load the trucks 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.299
 therefore on the edge of the field in the yard 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.310
 the barley is then over two 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.829
 Grain assumptions and two drying 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 'nen also supplied there is a flat 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 camp this year remains the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.829
 complete harvest first in the yard 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.999
 It was a barley in the spring so that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.130
 Although it sometimes quite a while 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.289
 but then cities after sale 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.719
 again , however, relatively fast 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.459
 downhill and now everything will be first 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.049
 so we stored the marketing 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.630
 move to the autumn and winter 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.060
 On the first field is the factory 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 now completed john weber is happy 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.479
 Have a good harvest on the yield 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.740
 they retracted 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.869
 on average ten tons per hectare 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 next year will be here to practice 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.539
 until then there will be an intercrop 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.539
 sown 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.370
 after the conversion of the thresher it works 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.709
 the raps are still scots 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 however, mostly empty three days ago 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.280
 it hailed here 95 percent loss 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 in eight hectares we were driving now 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 combine again and again 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.760
 to get that up once 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.989
 reasonable to distribute freely 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.120
 however, we do have the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.880
 four and a half hectares here off and yes 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.040
 the father blessed wolf the direct 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.720
 the insurance starts from the damage 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.470
 hurt by the leak of the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.519
 However, John Weber wear himself 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.410
 the actual damage will be in the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.150
 next years will come by that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.280
 very much rape now here on the ground 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.049
 it is hard to get up to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 so we will be in 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.420
 the following years with strong problems 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.200
 to expect by rape rapeseed 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.480
 have the following culture is here wheat 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.880
 At first, however, Johannes Weber will roll 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.040
 As much rapeseed as possible 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.980
 soon afterwards he brings a 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.380
 herbicidal and then two to three times 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.810
 not flat as possible 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.940
 buried and so we hope that now 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.320
 we have to get big casserole 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.630
 However, everything has already been done 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.280
 to see who can not get me also the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.350
 He will use the shredder again 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.109
 it can be six instead of three 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.579
 Work will be expensive 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.970
 short weather the webers have rapeseed 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.769
 on a total of 25 hectares cultivated what 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.290
 They harvest them from this store in this 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.730
 year complete a trade in 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.900
 Johannes Weber has had precontracts so far 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.700
 not completed 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.859
 fortunately the farmer says now we 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.600
 Say goodbye to salzdahlum and 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.670
 come back here in september 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.920
 then john weber reports of one 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.250
 Voluntary corridor exchange among new ones 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.870
 farmers spend 130 hectares if they have more 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.890
 want to know, click again 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:10.000
