00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.509
 nevertheless be tackled thus what exactly is the turn to start 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.589
 and 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.789
 processing io dead man's thumb more I am 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.960
 been on the move for a check 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.179
 and there are terraces around the country 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.300
 that will continue to drink 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.440
 therefore I still have nothing to use because 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.440
 a blackout was received 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.390
 it is a very difficult moment for me 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.899
 jacket yes drank too much 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.719
 njr core point to problems will be the three to four months in a row 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.840
 as an attempt, it breaks and I have seen you fall hard 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.960
 in seventh heaven but good 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.080
 been on the move and for years I have not moved on to the headline and 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.550
 then apparently I have someone else that's just like that 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.390
 that he must follow the schiedamse on his behalf to a buyer 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 different 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 which you easy 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.139
 it runs out of alcohol 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.909
 those moments 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.909
 Kyoto is writing this is nothing that you have a cocaine problem 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.760
 think rather a problem if I drink too much I have 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.980
 it might be unbelievable to get started 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.920
 364 thank because perfect 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.110
 and I think so 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.630
 nor did he think there was enough to do 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.160
 points have been improved and 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.370
 But I have heard that she drinks too much to make it unique 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.500
 live here 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.690
 tanabe 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.310
 women want to buy cilic and try again for maintenance 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.550
 Someone there not to interfere with what happens when I became Ballack Wednesday 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.550
 replacing someone else from her home that weekend 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.740
 professional help 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 can be a bit normal just what is still early at the moment 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.690
 and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 it will be important I think records lost some time 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 for myself and my family and pops bill 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.060
 it appears that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.480
 I know of myself that I am at Kallas 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.710
 all a good tournament and I am Benedict that problem is that it is not too fast and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.499
 to pull 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.410
 the conversation in the tower 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.210
 and the rest feels like runny 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.660
 but this is a storm that pours through the land everyone talks about psv 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.350
 for me that is incredible and for the rest it is only meant 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 is just like there 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.990
 that I am sitting here ending the leadership therefore voting as to avoid the old one 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.429
 had been church it was much easier the first moment the lema 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.229
 to make that uncertainty crazy and hm 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.099
 also performs with the team of course winning had been kidnapped 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 whatever at that time a fast-paced Broekman group of girlfriends 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.249
 I will break the count in a mandatory would still 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.029
 something happen to the team for myself, I don't care about fireworks 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.729
 you more my team mates him 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.079
 you have been put on non-active for the time being 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.359
 it seems as if not everyone agrees that they should continue with you 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.569
 with a church i will 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.769
 so will not be learned and almost every team knows what the man has and the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.579
 most people have known me differently for three years 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.949
 he dines then was a problem and that is palpable when views tap on 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:53.419
 role 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.269
 what I feel you can experience 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.059
 around the world and I think you don't have them yet 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.349
 shutter on the stake 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.750
 I try 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.140
 We will be strong to keep it starting gradually than some students 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.289
 Kenneth Roth people kick in July 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.649
 and that you a year earlier but on other crimes of a platform 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.149
 i think i know last year and i love you i must have 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.409
 more to come to other people it doesn't matter 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 a nice story but it is of course a need 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.369
 I have not heard of 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.659
 colleagues of the team 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.849
 I've been full of tuininga pcob at home for a week especially I think 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.899
 compete 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.899
 know that you put your mouth into that phase 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.590
 below ilse bijl examples 2k still calls mister cards crucible 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.569
 and that it is not just an accredited trainer 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.329
 I always have a bit of a problem that states that 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.719
 what i always have those cows falls away and i owe you if you sit it again i have 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.819
 I far to extreme case 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.359
 relative to other currencies and you don't know it 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.449
 chances are that you will sit in the seat again for a while 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.469
 nothing may cost not makers are invited 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.789
 I'll take that again 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.319
 I am currently working on the team from there to myself 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.969
 know if you have been city yourself for quite some time now you actually don't know 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.409
 sassenheim 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.490
 monique smit nevertheless spanned a Christian school on the spot 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.150
 and therefore the school era in the team as much as possible 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.439
 this is currently taking the pulse away 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.479
 for us says yes I see that smoking is not an option 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.919
 whatever you ask where needed 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.919
 yes you cost ample volvo now you do business 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.360
 it not right 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.590
 but they have the anp on I am in favor 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.669
 family year not on the family is that poor girl and 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.039
 manager i learned 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.659

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.490
 is doing well 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.760
 aln and I then make all the world know that works and stands and in it 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.669
 support and help with that but also
