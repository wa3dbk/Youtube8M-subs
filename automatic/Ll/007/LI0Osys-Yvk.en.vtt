00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:20.930
 And you and siblings? 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:23.930
 I saw these days intensely alive for God. 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.790
 My brother, we are walking at the end of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.900
 all things 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.550
 I do not know where you feel the density of 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.010
 stars 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:44.559
 hardly 41 days ago goodbye goodbye 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:46.850
 tenebrous the 'evil already aspires to live tragedy 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.870
 wickedness 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.130
 my own church 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.530
 without your profile 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:03.110
 God wants you and you save yourself. 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.170
 those who seek men's churches 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 religion establishments 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 seek God is time to seek God 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 until it rains justice upon you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 that if he clings to it he clings there he does not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.990
 want a relationship that many here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 they have a god and a created thing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 He wants a friend's relationship. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 How is God and God is Nokia Walked with? 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.759
 God 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.220
 It's time to walk with God. 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.690
 your best friend can not be a man and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 a woman 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.500
 Your best friend today has to be God is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:52.340
 the only one who can not betray is the only one who 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.340
 will not betray that god will not fail 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.810

 Where are you talking to me? 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.050
 me 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.660
 take this limited view that I have 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.500
 meek little earthling and gave me a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.230
 vision of your glory of your perfection of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.630
 your majesty 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.920
 The Bible says we should do the work 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.090
 in the one who called us 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.020
 while I do what comes at night and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 No one can work crazy 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.030
 tonight they asked your soul 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.260
 What has been prepared knows one thing 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.260
 most of my life 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.350
 at least nine years of my life 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.889
 of the 11 that I am already converted 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.760
 I fought all my life to try 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.430
 make the men bitter and commission from that 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.669
 river disk falls from my eyes 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.150
 because men do not keep 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.050
 that you felt the challenge of all 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.419
 ways that you know all the resources 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.320
 not to notice a church 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.099
 you would already be full but for 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.250
 make men 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.250
 love God 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.710
 to make them have an alliance 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:12.090
 not to make the beggars of my god 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.450
 god as accessory crutch but still to do 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.110
 men have a language without breaking 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.920
 the suitcase of all 45 and sometimes I 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.540
 I'm sad when I can not do this. 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.120
 when people come with what they have 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.120
 Case molds are Disrespectful boules 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.340
 they talk 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.110
 nobel praise do not worship the church 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.010
 mere social club 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.550
 there are few that have alliances but 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.800
 who love god about all the bad things 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.889
 that look at that man on Calvary 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.570
 with the crown of thorns full of blood 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.620
 and they had loved it, I loved it 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.449
 This frustrates me when I can not do it. 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.270
 When I do not do the church the time of 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.090
 worship when I do not do men 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.120
 come to God's house just because I love you 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.699
 not that they came to ask those who came 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.699
 lock came from his life 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.310
 and aware that the greatest commandment 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.840
 center of all the book is to love the Lord 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:33.340
 Your God, with all your heart be 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:36.520
 take this god of history from your 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.480
 life of your things that tito sucam to 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.480
 alliance with god
