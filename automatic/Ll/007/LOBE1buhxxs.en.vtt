00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
15 out of them so 3 3.3 % with just 100

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.360 
15 out of them so 3 3.3 % with just 100
coins<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.250> rest<00:00:41.520> went<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.940> too<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.239> like

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
coins the rest went for too much like

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
coins the rest went for too much like
about<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:44.789> 1.1<00:00:45.750> k<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.820> 3k<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.590> they

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
about over 1.1 k to like 3k but they

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.010 
about over 1.1 k to like 3k but they
don't<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> lot<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> money<00:00:50.370> even<00:00:50.700> golds<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
don't make a lot of money even golds so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.799 
don't make a lot of money even golds so
yeah<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.399> today

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
yeah that's what I'm going to do today

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.470 
yeah that's what I'm going to do today
um<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.340> why<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> fullback

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
um so that's why if you get a fullback

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
um so that's why if you get a fullback
you<00:00:57.690> probably<00:00:58.020> shouldn't<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.590> i'll<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.710> put

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
