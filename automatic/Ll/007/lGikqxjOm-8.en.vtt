00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 Saturday, December 28 the quinté 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.360
 take place in the bar-le-duc a price 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.309
 test of good quality we made the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.929
 lots of starters in this competition 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 since they will be twenty from 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.150
 this meeting 10 at the first rung 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 as much in the second with horses as 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.359
 we know well in such a society 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 Here is my selection I placed the head 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 number six teas from china 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.660
 the horse remains in several places 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 of honor, each time providing 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 good values ​​it will be deferré of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.880
 four feet for this purpose it depends 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 strongly xiii shaped without him 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 claude dersoir he is well engaged in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 first echelon brief it constitutes to my 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 opinion a basic game all indicated I him 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 ask number 20 rue de l'hérault who 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 is none other than the holder of the title of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.809
 this test a horse that we know 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 well and who has a hint of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 very sharp final speed he needs 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 always enjoyed a good journey 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.449
 hidden when that's the case he's able 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 to finish very quickly on 300 400 m here he 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.850
 will especially have one against him from duty 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 make the distance 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 in a bunch any girl but if the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.589
 course and conveniences he has 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.159
 perfectly ways to put everything 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.020
 the world okay 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.390
 as he did last year in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.729
 anyway patrick martin always has it at 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 better that's what he actually told me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 I have a number 12 oars it's him to my 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 notice it can cause a nice surprise 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.040
 in this event he also has a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 nice final speed spike 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 if the pace is sustained it should be a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 once again finished fast and this to my 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.119
 notice to beautiful rating 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.200
 the number 3 seductive phu tho attention 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.970
 to him the path is at best he remains 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 on two second places he is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 always presented unfurnished the four to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.979
 well, this is the case here 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.790
 he will be his last bare foot out 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.439
 it was also due to a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 second place in my opinion at first 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.290
 echelon he can why not who were 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.759
 the previous cities 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.050
 then I took the name of that fear 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.760
 that we know this level well 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.530
 the account already seven wins at the level 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.270
 quinté plus he too must benefit 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 a hidden route like ruud l'hérault 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.510
 and at 25 meters it annoys me a little 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.520
 little since he will have to fight a 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.110
 passage in the national last 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.670
 times during his success in the price 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 jean dumouch they were both 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.520
 well placed in the wake of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 the animator and dominated him to finish 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.510
 this time they will be obligatorily 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.400
 more than him before because she 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.770
 fall will have to be brought before 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.080
 cope with initial handicap of 25 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.790
 then I'm number 10 14 his wishes 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.710
 rischmann a hard horse to the effort that 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.730
 we know who shone this 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.520
 year throughout the year in the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.260
 circuit of the national grand trot the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 number 5 of heather scan this is a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.670
 good mare has been preserved by the stable 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 hump done here she seems to me able 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.930
 to hold her part even if she has to 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.910
 face the number 2 males 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 also say some time another mare 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 quality a little intermittent 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.830
 but his last victory is said to be long 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.870
 on his 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 current possibilities and in my opinion has 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.890
 entrusted and driver christophe martens 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.460
 as the last time she announces herself 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.870
 formidable 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.160
 with conditions and who is the most 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 benefited from the same route remember 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.410
 1st time and well the pub benefited from a 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.700
 excellent course along the front rail 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.060
 to find the opening just side 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.280
 rope 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 the resident of jean clotaire evening 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.210
 deporting slightly to his right at 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.340
 moment of the final sprint 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.880
 numerical summary for this competition 6 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.890
 20 12 and 3 then the 11 the 14 the 5 and 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 the 2-1 continuation of the program in vincennes 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.970
 in the price yvonnick bodin that makes 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.770
 tribute to a young pilot at too early 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.350
 disappeared this group iii reserved for 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.150
 apprentices lads jockeys seems to be summed up 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.880
 in my opinion on the paper between a duel 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.410
 between 314 fast of the digeon in 315 rubies 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.150
 dairpet of horses that come 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.410
 precisely finished first second of a 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.910
 proof of the same invoice are the most 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.860
 rich of the lot probably the most talented 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.330
 they face a nice commitment to 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.200
 cap of brief earnings they should they 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.120
 will have to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.910
 again explain to the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.269
 314 fast win of 315 pounds 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.440
 mobilire also pays attention to 311 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.730
 golden creatine who owns a beautiful 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.390
 basic speed but also proven 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.849
 that he was holding 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.110
 he comes from cards and finished 4th of 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.860
 this reference race and why 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.959
 not completed the podium 314 3 115 311 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.390
 in the seventh I advise the 706 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.890
 Huron of the cb that gets along well with 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.110
 marie bakchich who comes from elsewhere 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.519
 lead her to success she this mare is 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.930
 late gains to her to prove it 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.530
 in this race again that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.970
 seems within range of 706 on ron dcb to 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.360
 pau in meeting ii I advise you to 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.190
 101 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 it is charlotte who has just won 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.370
 precisely this cross palois the horse to 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.280
 the march crosses him in my opinion he can 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.510
 be directed then on the best in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.160
 any case facing the best and facing the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.519
 cadors of the discipline on this cross 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.049
 Pau 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.010
 here he finds once again a 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.680
 nice opportunity to highlight 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.989
 be careful that twice at 204 that's 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.350
 sacred tpiy other protected emmanuel 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.280
 clay that precisely sherlock 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.320
 sacred thierry which will be entrusted I 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.940
 still plougasnou sherlock it will be david 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.920
 cottin a match in the match between these 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.710
 two 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.870
 pilots fighting from the beginning 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.970
 of the year for the title of the whip 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.190
 of gold 2013 the 205 laughter 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.410
 jérôme training the horse 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.810
 is he is fit he likes on 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.490
 the racecourse of pau and in my opinion in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.050
 this lot it can take a place in any 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.590
 case I stealing the prepare for this 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.910
 meeting of 100 1 204 and 205 of a sixth 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.920
 I recommend 602 that has a cost 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.600
 which counts three races at the meter a 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.910
 third place in beginner followed by 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 two victories including one on the course that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.560
 interests us 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.040
 nothing stands in the way of a confirmation 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.630
 it's a good foal philippe pelletier 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.890
 should once again be done 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.970
 pleasure with him anyway here the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.650
 horse finds a great opportunity to 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.140
 fight for the first places 602 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.650
 who alco in the seventh a beautiful 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.760
 test 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.740
 remember thierry de lauriere 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.120
 told me lately that the 703 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.320
 gecko lightnings is a mare who 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.790
 went out of the ordinary and approve it 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.290
 since she stays on three victories 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.420
 consecutive ones including two on the 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.730
 steeple-chase is an exceptional mare 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.470
 and in this kind of category queen the 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.020
 margin of the race so able to 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.270
 continue his victorious harvest of 703 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.880
 thunderbolts of the pecos the opposition does not 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.890
 doubt the 701 violent bréjoux and the 707 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 hydrogen respectively displayed 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.940
 first and second of a test of 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.280
 same invoice at the beginning of the month on the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.230
 course that interests us the three 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.310
 thousand seven types of pots chairs a 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.510
 again his horses should 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.750
 can be explained for the first 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.030
 seats 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.100
 when I put figure is 703 700 1 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.030
 707 that's why continue the 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.820
 calls precisely second place 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.250
 but the seventh at 220 200 4 602 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.260
 and 703 1 and 7 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.880
 this is for the information of this Saturday 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.750
 very good game to all and make you 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.750
