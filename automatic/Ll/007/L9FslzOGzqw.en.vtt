00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.330 
barely see that but so far as
performance<00:05:43.520> wise<00:05:47.529> this<00:05:48.529> is<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.860> same<00:05:49.069> kind

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
performance wise this is the same kind

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.399 
performance wise this is the same kind
of<00:05:49.430> welding<00:05:49.819> we<00:05:49.969> do<00:05:50.150> everywhere<00:05:50.750> on<00:05:50.960> this<00:05:51.110> gun

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
of welding we do everywhere on this gun

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.240 
of welding we do everywhere on this gun
safe<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.949> every<00:05:52.430> gun<00:05:52.639> safe

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
safe and every gun safe

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.230 
safe and every gun safe
good<00:05:55.250> strong<00:05:55.779> beads<00:05:56.779> and<00:05:57.759> well<00:05:58.759> I<00:05:58.789> guess<00:05:59.029> we've

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
good strong beads and well I guess we've

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.019 
good strong beads and well I guess we've
proven<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.810> we<00:06:00.319> can<00:06:00.650> resist<00:06:01.099> quite<00:06:01.639> a<00:06:01.669> bit<00:06:01.909> of

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
proven that we can resist quite a bit of

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.230 
proven that we can resist quite a bit of
pressure<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.919> hope<00:06:04.159> this<00:06:04.339> seems<00:06:04.909> credible

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
pressure and I hope this seems credible

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.570 
pressure and I hope this seems credible
to<00:06:05.689> you<00:06:05.839> we<00:06:06.020> went<00:06:06.529> to<00:06:06.650> great<00:06:06.889> lengths<00:06:07.339> to<00:06:07.460> make

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
to you we went to great lengths to make

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.779 
to you we went to great lengths to make
sure<00:06:07.849> that<00:06:08.800> no<00:06:09.800> one<00:06:09.979> would<00:06:10.129> say<00:06:10.339> that<00:06:10.550> we<00:06:10.639> were

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
sure that no one would say that we were

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.600 
sure that no one would say that we were
cheating<00:06:11.210> so<00:06:12.129> anyway<00:06:13.129> if<00:06:13.189> you<00:06:13.339> have<00:06:13.460> any

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
cheating so anyway if you have any

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.810 
cheating so anyway if you have any
questions<00:06:14.060> call<00:06:14.330> sturdy
