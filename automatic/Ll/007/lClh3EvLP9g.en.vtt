00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
dreaming about for like 15 seconds

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.280 
dreaming about for like 15 seconds
wasting<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> shot<00:02:36.280> clock<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.959> see<00:02:38.170> what

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
wasting the shot clock and it see what

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650 
wasting the shot clock and it see what
happens<00:02:38.319> now<00:02:38.799> since<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.790> passion<00:02:40.480> II<00:02:40.599> the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
happens now since the passion II the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.870 
happens now since the passion II the
ball<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:41.319> two<00:02:41.590> seconds<00:02:42.160> left<00:02:42.220> when<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.549> can't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
ball with two seconds left when I can't

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.460 
ball with two seconds left when I can't
do<00:02:43.000> anything<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.870> Paul<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
do anything and I get Paul for a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.819 
do anything and I get Paul for a
turnover<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:45.010> what<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
turnover like what is that

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.220 
turnover like what is that
next<00:02:47.829> plate<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:49.239> see<00:02:49.599> what<00:02:49.660> happens<00:02:50.079> it's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
next plate that see what happens it's

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.440 
next plate that see what happens it's
this<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.590> bad<00:02:50.829> pass<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:51.430> that's<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.269> bad

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
this is the bad pass but that's a bad

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.180 
this is the bad pass but that's a bad
pass<00:02:52.690> though<00:02:52.900> how's<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.530> ball<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:53.860> look<00:02:53.980> over

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
pass though how's the ball in look over

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.380 
pass though how's the ball in look over
there<00:02:54.340> how<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.849> like<00:02:54.970> what's<00:02:55.150> kind<00:02:55.329> of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
there how this is like what's kind of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.910 
there how this is like what's kind of
physics<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.200> where<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> took<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
physics with that where you took the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.809 
physics with that where you took the
ball<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.280> way<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:59.819> see

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
ball that way like what is that and see

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.050 
ball that way like what is that and see
this<00:03:01.650> see<00:03:02.650> what<00:03:02.769> happens<00:03:03.100> now<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.639> come<00:03:04.030> through

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
this see what happens now I come through

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.900 
this see what happens now I come through
and<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.959> just<00:03:04.989> leave<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.680> ball<00:03:05.859> at<00:03:06.220> random

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and I just leave the ball at random

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.569 
and I just leave the ball at random
again<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:08.620> they<00:03:08.739> decide<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.100> Kevin

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
again because they decide that Kevin

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.370 
again because they decide that Kevin
Durant<00:03:09.880> needs<00:03:10.090> another<00:03:10.359> stone<00:03:10.600> that's<00:03:11.139> what

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
Durant needs another stone that's what

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.220 
Durant needs another stone that's what
happened<00:03:11.889> look<00:03:12.519> at<00:03:12.609> if<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.850> no<00:03:12.970> motion<00:03:13.389> I'm

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
happened look at if it's no motion I'm

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.500 
happened look at if it's no motion I'm
dribbling<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.549> lose<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.060> ball

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
dribbling and I just lose the ball

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.460 
dribbling and I just lose the ball
for<00:03:16.690> granting<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:18.239> what<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.389> this<00:03:19.569> really

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
for granting you what is this really

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.809 
for granting you what is this really
good<00:03:20.620> with<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.859> scene<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.370> randomly

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
good with the scene on this randomly

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.449 
good with the scene on this randomly
using<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> ball<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.040> best<00:03:24.280> I

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
using the ball and this is the best I

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.580 
using the ball and this is the best I
think<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.849> Russell<00:03:25.450> Westbrook<00:03:25.780> has<00:03:25.959> magic

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
think that Russell Westbrook has magic

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.300 
think that Russell Westbrook has magic
hands<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:28.209> see<00:03:28.420> how<00:03:28.599> fast<00:03:28.900> he<00:03:29.139> moves<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.799> pick

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
hands you see how fast he moves to pick

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.879 
hands you see how fast he moves to pick
that<00:03:30.519> pants<00:03:30.849> off<00:03:31.120> flakes<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.930> feelings<00:03:32.440> wrong

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
that pants off flakes and feelings wrong

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.839 
that pants off flakes and feelings wrong
with<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.130> game<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:35.370> look<00:03:36.370> at<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:36.609> play

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
with this game and look at this play

that<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:23.070> those<00:04:23.490> 11<00:04:24.120> turnovers<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:26.010> we

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that so of those 11 turnovers that we

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.659 
that so of those 11 turnovers that we
saw<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:26.970> canoe<00:04:27.630> these<00:04:27.750> clips<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.430> said<00:04:29.430> I

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
saw in this canoe these clips I said I

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.210 
saw in this canoe these clips I said I
think<00:04:29.940> three<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.660> them<00:04:30.810> were<00:04:31.260> bad<00:04:31.530> passes<00:04:31.860> if<00:04:32.100> I

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
think three of them were bad passes if I

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.030 
think three of them were bad passes if I
remember<00:04:32.550> correctly<00:04:33.139> and<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.350> posted<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.830> Nate

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
remember correctly and I posted up Nate

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.550 
remember correctly and I posted up Nate
Robinson<00:04:35.250> which<00:04:35.790> i<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.020> good<00:04:37.229> play

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
Robinson which i think is a good play

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.379 
Robinson which i think is a good play
but<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.190> game<00:04:38.400> apparently<00:04:38.880> doesn't<00:04:39.180> think<00:04:39.330> so

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
but the game apparently doesn't think so

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.690 
but the game apparently doesn't think so
so<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.740> was<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:40.889> turnover<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.460> three<00:04:41.669> four

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
so that was a turnover so three four

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.460 
so that was a turnover so three four
