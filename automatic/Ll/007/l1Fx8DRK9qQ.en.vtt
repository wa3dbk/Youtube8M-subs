00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello everyone and all have long been accustomed to who 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.780
 subscribed to my channel that I post 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.610
 always some simple reefs 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 what mean simple reefs usually 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.369
 I pick up those where ri usually there 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.369
 some sort of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 two hits on 6 and then something like that 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 I select but because in such a rhythm of eggs they 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.880
 so many songs I donâ€™t know what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.379
 make you simple 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.050
 reefs and decided to lay out reefs just a little 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.000
 more difficult that is already with some 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.000
 such rhythms 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.470
 that is, we play 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.190
 Well, something like that this rhythm, I can not 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.360
 same show you slowly it's three there 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:34.790
 need to hear and when you hear it you 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:39.470
 you can already play the reef 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.560
 reefs will spread as show 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.790
 what kind of quint can there be any more 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.270
 there are nuances there and then just play 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.590
 this reef you will already know what there 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.970
 rhythm and you will know what chords are there and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.660
 have to pick this rhythm yourself so probably 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:10.280
 learning will be more interesting since 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:15.590
 show how it will be slow 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.330
 I donâ€™t know well today see one of 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.720
 so simple 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.880
 reefs will participate only three fifths 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:30.530
 and this is clint 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:38.500
 again client a 5 diez and clint 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.500
 all three fifths and such a rhythm 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.590
 Well, look how the whole rhythm is played 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.590
 fluted 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.209
 or 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.470
 and
