00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650 
he could probably take it as far as you
can<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.770> he<00:02:29.070> wants<00:02:29.370> he's<00:02:30.060> got<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> mentality

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
can as he wants he's got the mentality

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.610 
can as he wants he's got the mentality
you<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:32.040> support<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.900> think<00:02:34.560> he

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you know the support and I think he

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.449 
you know the support and I think he
could<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.430> take<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> far<00:02:40.220> box<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.430> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
could be well and take it far box for a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.850 
could be well and take it far box for a
little<00:02:41.580> bit<00:02:41.790> nothing<00:02:42.510> serious<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.230> ended<00:02:43.800> up

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
