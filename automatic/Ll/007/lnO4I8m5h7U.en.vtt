and I was driving around yesterday and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.190 
and I was driving around yesterday and
found<00:00:28.380> this

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.170 

hich<00:00:31.620> ate<00:00:32.630> Belgian<00:00:33.630> horses<00:00:34.250> pulling<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.580> nine

hich ate Belgian horses pulling a nine
foot<00:00:36.660> wide<00:00:37.050> disc<00:00:38.870> they're<00:00:41.570> kissing<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
foot wide disc they're kissing up the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.869 
foot wide disc they're kissing up the
corn<00:00:44.910> stalks<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.690> getting<00:00:46.260> ready<00:00:46.470> to<00:00:46.770> plant

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
corn stalks here getting ready to plant

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
corn stalks here getting ready to plant
so<00:00:48.690> probably<00:00:49.260> plant<00:00:49.620> soybeans<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.640> field

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so probably plant soybeans in this field

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.200 
so probably plant soybeans in this field
usually

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
usually

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.770 
usually
plant<00:00:52.890> corn<00:00:53.890> one<00:00:54.160> year<00:00:54.460> then<00:00:54.760> soybeans<00:00:55.240> next

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
plant corn one year then soybeans next

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.340 
plant corn one year then soybeans next
and<00:00:56.020> keep<00:00:56.350> rotating<00:00:56.590> that<00:00:57.160> way<00:00:58.080> hmm

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
and keep rotating that way hmm

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.020 
and keep rotating that way hmm
so<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.970> is<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.830> Amish<00:01:03.280> farm<00:01:03.610> in<00:01:03.880> our

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
so this is the way the Amish farm in our

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.410 
so this is the way the Amish farm in our
community<00:01:04.540> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
community and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.310 
community and
this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.380> brute<00:01:08.130> strength<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.000> using<00:01:09.480> 8

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this is just brute strength and using 8

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.760 
this is just brute strength and using 8
horses<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.250> pull<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.120> disc<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.440> hero

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
horses to pull this disc with a hero

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.289 
horses to pull this disc with a hero
behind<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
behind it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.569 
behind it
and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.930> later<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> video<00:01:16.799> you'll<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.399> a

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
and then later in the video you'll see a

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.200 
and then later in the video you'll see a
four-horse<00:01:18.299> hitch<00:01:19.280> pulling<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.460> motorised

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
four-horse hitch pulling a motorised

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
four-horse hitch pulling a motorised
tiller<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:23.039> tiller<00:01:23.280> does<00:01:23.579> most<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.969> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
tiller and the tiller does most of the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.740 
tiller and the tiller does most of the
work<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.960> easier<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.789> pull<00:01:26.789> than

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
work and it's much easier to pull than

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.910 
work and it's much easier to pull than
what<00:01:28.189> this<00:01:29.189> disc<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.359> here<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.679> can<00:01:31.799> also

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
what this disc is here and he can also

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.399 
what this disc is here and he can also
do<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> wider<00:01:32.700> swath<00:01:33.179> I<00:01:33.569> think<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.170> about

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
do a wider swath I think that was about

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
do a wider swath I think that was about
a<00:01:34.439> 12<00:01:34.799> foot<00:01:35.009> wide

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
a 12 foot wide

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.289 
a 12 foot wide
and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.380> across<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> fence<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and then just across the fence on the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.200 
and then just across the fence on the
other<00:01:39.330> side<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> road<00:01:40.159> there's<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.490> big

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
other side of the road there's this big

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.640 
other side of the road there's this big
four-wheel<00:01:42.750> drive

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
four-wheel drive

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.240 
four-wheel drive
John<00:01:43.890> Deere<00:01:44.190> tractor<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.500> he<00:01:46.500> probably<00:01:46.830> had

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
John Deere tractor and he probably had

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.450 
John Deere tractor and he probably had
about<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.580> 36<00:01:48.270> foot<00:01:48.570> wide<00:01:48.810> field<00:01:49.259> kolevatov<00:01:49.800> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
about a 36 foot wide field kolevatov and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.540 
about a 36 foot wide field kolevatov and
he's<00:01:51.299> riding<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.930> air-conditioned<00:01:52.860> comfort

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
he's riding in air-conditioned comfort

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.370 
he's riding in air-conditioned comfort
the<00:01:54.360> Amish<00:01:54.659> man<00:01:54.900> was<00:01:55.369> having<00:01:56.369> eat<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> dust

there's quite a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.580 
there's quite a
difference<00:02:03.710> in<00:02:03.980> technology<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.230> it's

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
difference in technology here and it's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.150 
difference in technology here and it's
one<00:02:06.890> was<00:02:07.130> right<00:02:07.370> inside<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.090> other<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:10.750> after

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
we work this ground then they have

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520 
we work this ground then they have
another<00:02:16.800> tractor<00:02:17.550> pulling<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.060> platter<00:02:18.530> and
