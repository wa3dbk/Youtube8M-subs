00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.130 
let me go ahead and do that I'll grab my
guitar<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:55.240> can<00:01:55.450> listen<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.810> how<00:01:56.049> it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
guitar and you can listen to how it

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.770 
guitar and you can listen to how it
sounds<00:01:56.170> recording<00:01:56.710> an<00:01:56.770> instrument<00:01:57.189> as<00:01:57.280> well

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
sounds recording an instrument as well

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.419

so as you can hear also this is what it

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.190 
so as you can hear also this is what it
sounds<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:00.700> far<00:02:01.090> away<00:02:01.390> from<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.020> can

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200

I<00:05:02.360> can<00:05:02.780> only<00:05:02.900> imagine<00:05:03.020> what<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.160> c3<00:05:04.910> is<00:05:05.450> like

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
I can only imagine what the c3 is like

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.560 
I can only imagine what the c3 is like
it's<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.370> directional<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.640> just<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:07.910> one

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570

it's a directional this is just a one
diaphragm<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:08.990> other<00:05:09.200> one<00:05:09.320> has<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.650> c3<00:05:10.400> has<00:05:10.550> a

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
diaphragm the other one has the c3 has a

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.410 
diaphragm the other one has the c3 has a
dual<00:05:10.910> diaphragm<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.630> think<00:05:12.230> it's<00:05:12.460> 50<00:05:13.460> 60<00:05:14.060> bucks

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.440 
dual diaphragm I think it's 50 60 bucks
so<00:05:15.080> like<00:05:15.230> that<00:05:15.410> so<00:05:15.940> they're<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.180> exact<00:05:17.420> same

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450
