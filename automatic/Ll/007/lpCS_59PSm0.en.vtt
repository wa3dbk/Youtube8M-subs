for<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> money<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.680> car<00:01:08.240> if<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:09.510> running

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
for the money this car if I was running

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
for the money this car if I was running
Chevrolet<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.100> car<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Chevrolet I would want this car to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
Chevrolet I would want this car to
standards<00:01:12.090> own<00:01:12.380> more<00:01:13.380> tighter<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> speak

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
standards own more tighter so to speak

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.999

and<00:01:14.520> say<00:01:14.700> great<00:01:15.330> car<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.950> conversation<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and say great car and conversation I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.890 
and say great car and conversation I
think<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.490> made<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> global<00:01:18.119> car<00:01:18.299> phone<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
think they made a global car phone I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
think they made a global car phone I
think<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.290> made<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> car<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
think they made a car that can be in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
think they made a car that can be in
Europe<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> streets<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> Ferrari<00:01:21.960> did

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
Europe on the streets with a Ferrari did

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.280 
Europe on the streets with a Ferrari did
they<00:01:22.830> maybe<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.150> European<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> style<00:01:25.110> in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
they maybe go to European the style in

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
they maybe go to European the style in
this<00:01:25.409> car<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.369> soften<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:26.909> too<00:01:27.210> much

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this car they soften a little too much

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
this car they soften a little too much
does<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.840> enough<00:01:27.869> american-ness<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
does it have enough american-ness I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.060 
does it have enough american-ness I
don't<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.150> honestly<00:01:30.920> cards

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
don't think so I think honestly cards

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.190 
don't think so I think honestly cards
badass<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.549> mean<00:01:35.090> they<00:01:35.240> really<00:01:35.539> just<00:01:35.659> kind<00:01:36.170> of

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
badass I mean they really just kind of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.609 
badass I mean they really just kind of
sculpted<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:36.860> more<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.159> mean<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.490> still<00:01:37.700> has<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
sculpted in more I mean it still has the

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.620 
sculpted in more I mean it still has the
basic<00:01:39.619> silhouette<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.490> support<00:01:41.149> best<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:41.509> all

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
basic silhouette of support best we all

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.230 
basic silhouette of support best we all
know<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.930> love<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.439> they<00:01:43.039> just<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.820> honed

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
know and love but they just really honed

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.440 
know and love but they just really honed
in<00:01:44.509> sculpting<00:01:45.409> more<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.490> lot<00:01:46.700> more<00:01:46.909> angles

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
in sculpting more in a lot more angles

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.380 
in sculpting more in a lot more angles
in<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.840> meter<00:01:48.289> look<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.070> think<00:01:49.390> it's

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
in a meter look and I think it's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.840 
in a meter look and I think it's
benefiting<00:01:51.289> from<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.470> yeah<00:01:51.920> even<00:01:52.759> though

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
benefiting from that yeah even though

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.830 
benefiting from that yeah even though
that<00:01:53.030> if<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.149> look<00:01:53.270> at<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.450> front<00:01:53.659> three

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
that if you look at the front three

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.910 
that if you look at the front three
quarter<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:55.100> Ferrari<00:01:56.350> 458<00:01:57.350> right<00:01:57.770> now

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
quarter that and a Ferrari 458 right now

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.520 
quarter that and a Ferrari 458 right now
they<00:01:58.130> look<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.299> squint<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.929> same<00:02:00.259> cup

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
they look if you squint the same cup

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.830 
they look if you squint the same cup
engineers<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.220> GM<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.850> engineers<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.479> Ferrari
