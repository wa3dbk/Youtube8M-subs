00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 how about friends through back and they 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 I bring lactancia installation of exposÃ© 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.940
 for gps 5.1 I want to emphasize that only 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 you can use in the official gp 5.1 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 according to the developers as always 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.779
 I will leave the links in the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.820
 description in addition to a link dedicated to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
 the x page of up where it shows 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 what are the compatible modules up to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.250
 the moment as you can see I find 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.250
 at 5.1 gp 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.140
 and I have gravity box installed here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.699
 at that time I will teach them how 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.129
 install it from scratch I wanted to tell you 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.800
 that every time there is an update 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.690
 I will upload it in the description of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 video first of all the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 recommendations is always to have the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.370
 unlocked the drivers of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 Motorola installed debug usb 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.440
 activated and the phone rooted this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 last process I'll do in this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.409
 same video and I'll leave the link 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.720
 in the information circle ready in the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.720
 description will find this file 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.390
 rare exports set for 5.1 which 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 contains this folder here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 in which we're going to have two files one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 is the ex post alpha 3 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 the apec up and the other is the zip file 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.100
 that we are going to flash by recovery this 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.430
 from here we will pass it to memory 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.430
 internal 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 staying in this way 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.060
 next we are going to proceed to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.370
 activate usb debugging if it is already 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.040
 we did not have it active let's turn off the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.470
 device and put it in facebook mode 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.500
 we already see easy and with the usb cable 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.800
 connected what we are going to do is open 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.460
 the rich custom folder in tw erp 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.430
 for gp which have the link in the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.930
 description once here we will give 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.930
 in flash recovery 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.739
 what he is going to do is after flashing 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.630
 restart it again the easy way to 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.780
 continuation 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.600
 we are going to close this folder and go to the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 root folder they have in the video 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 to do this procedure 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.020
 we open the root windows bat file 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.250
 which tells us to press a 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.250
 key we are going to give you enter 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.790
 we are going to restart the device and it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.480
 they will start to optimize the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.480
 Applications 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.510
 for this you can disconnect the cable 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.510
 usb 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.540
 this optimization will depend on 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.610
 how many applications we have installed 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.110
 in my case I only had one additional per 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.110
 which I leave a hundred days nothing more 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.610
 we unlock 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.530
 well what we are going to do is turn off the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.270
 device again enter the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.850
 'recovery' to be able to do the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.460
 installation of exposition on facebook 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.470
 we go down with the volume key - and 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.470
 we accept enrico erico to one more volume 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.600
 now we are going to head to white 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.569
 advanced wide we select dalvik cache 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.060
 and cache 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.060
 we give you white white 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.760
 back we go back again and again 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.040
 finally we are going to install 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.550
 let's go down we'll see our expo file 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.330
 set to rm we select it we move the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.330
 bar to install 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.470
 and finally we give in reboot system 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 again going to perform an optimization 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.950
 we enter again 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.440
 and as a last step is to go to the explorer 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.600
 of files we select the application 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.650
 of expos set 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.400
 install for this we have to have 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.360
 configured the installation of 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.320
 applications from unknown sources 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.340
 we go to configuration 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.770
 we enable it accept we return we give it 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.550
 back to the application install 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.740
 install accept for satisfaction 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.390
 our is already installed and only 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.390
 I would give it to open 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.539
 smart friends that would be everything and we could 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.789
 have already exposed in our gps 5.1 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.429
 as I was saying in the description 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.039
 I'm going to leave the link of x up where 

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:10.889
 says that in modules they are compatible for 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.869
 this super alpha version as always 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.429

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:17.069
 have been useful do not forget about
