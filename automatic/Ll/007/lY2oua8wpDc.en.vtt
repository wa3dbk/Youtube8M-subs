than scratch the surface at this stage
is<00:00:50.480> kidding<00:00:51.170> themselves<00:00:51.320> we've<00:00:52.250> got<00:00:52.550> a

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
century more of discovery and I think

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.270 
century more of discovery and I think
that<00:00:56.660> we<00:00:56.780> can<00:00:56.990> see<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.350> exciting<00:00:57.800> discoveries

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
that we can see the exciting discoveries

that we can see the exciting discoveries
that<00:00:58.370> are<00:00:58.460> coming<00:00:58.760> out<00:00:58.820> every<00:00:59.120> week<00:00:59.150> it<00:00:59.630> is

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
that are coming out every week it is

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.660 
that are coming out every week it is
going<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.410> be<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> really<00:01:00.980> exciting<00:01:01.280> time<00:01:01.640> for

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
going to be a really exciting time for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.869 
going to be a really exciting time for
biology<00:01:02.330> I<00:01:02.630> think<00:01:03.620> it's<00:01:03.770> fair<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.280> say<00:01:04.309> that

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
biology I think it's fair to say that

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.630 
biology I think it's fair to say that
history<00:01:05.089> will<00:01:05.570> look<00:01:05.810> back<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.040> sequencing

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
history will look back on the sequencing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.130 
history will look back on the sequencing
of<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.790> human<00:01:07.909> genome<00:01:08.210> as<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.900> most

of the human genome as the most

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
science up until that point and I know

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.480 
science up until that point and I know
that's<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.140> bold<00:01:15.380> statement<00:01:15.710> because<00:01:16.340> there

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
that's a bold statement because there

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.620 
that's a bold statement because there
are<00:01:16.550> other<00:01:16.640> pretty<00:01:17.000> significant
