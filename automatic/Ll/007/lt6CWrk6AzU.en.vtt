00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
channels I just never thought how to do

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
channels I just never thought how to do
it<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.149> ghost<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.140> new<00:00:43.320> video<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it because ghost was the new video I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.959 
it because ghost was the new video I
thought<00:00:43.860> people<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.489> watch<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
thought people would like to watch it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
thought people would like to watch it
but<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.420> doesn't<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.200> turn<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> be

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
but it doesn't really turn out to be

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490 
but it doesn't really turn out to be
that<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.510> yeah<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that way so yeah I don't really want to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
that way so yeah I don't really want to
be<00:00:49.559> posting<00:00:50.100> ghosts<00:00:50.610> videos<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.239> people
