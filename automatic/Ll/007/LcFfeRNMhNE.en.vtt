so<00:01:15.950> I'm<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> feel

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so I'm kind of I don't know how I feel

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
so I'm kind of I don't know how I feel
about<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.920> um<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.970> getting<00:01:21.240> nervous

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
about that um I'm just getting nervous

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
about that um I'm just getting nervous
about<00:01:22.350> how<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.740> gonna<00:01:22.860> lose<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.340> hair<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about how I'm gonna lose my hair and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
about how I'm gonna lose my hair and
when<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.110> come<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.590> chunks

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
when if it's gonna come out in chunks

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.340 
when if it's gonna come out in chunks
like<00:01:26.280> I've<00:01:26.460> heard<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.330> what's<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:27.840> happen

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
like I've heard or what's gonna happen

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.640 
like I've heard or what's gonna happen
so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.009> guess<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.240> taking<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.110> day<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so I guess I'm taking that one day at a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.600 
so I guess I'm taking that one day at a
time

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
time

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
time
and<00:01:33.030> we'll<00:01:33.720> figure<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> happens

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and we'll figure it out when it happens

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.359 
and we'll figure it out when it happens
whether<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.549> shave<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:35.850> head<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.450> day<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:37.369> what

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
whether I shave my head that day or what

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.600 
whether I shave my head that day or what
I<00:01:38.640> end<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:39.000> deciding<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:41.460> an

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I end up deciding to do so that's an

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.319 
I end up deciding to do so that's an
update<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.020> tomorrow<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.880> definitely

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

keep<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.689> guys<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> loop<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.890> what's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
keep you guys in the loop of what's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.280

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
going on but I also was wondering if

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
going on but I also was wondering if
because<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> chemo<00:01:53.340> weeks<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.970> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because I know on the chemo weeks I do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
because I know on the chemo weeks I do
quite<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> few<00:01:54.899> videos<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> off<00:01:56.070> weeks

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
quite a few videos but on the off weeks

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
quite a few videos but on the off weeks
when<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.820> actually<00:01:57.030> feeling<00:01:57.329> pretty<00:01:57.630> good<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
when I'm actually feeling pretty good I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.709 
when I'm actually feeling pretty good I
know<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.670> too<00:01:59.880> many<00:01:59.969> updates<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.689> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
know I don't do too many updates so I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
know I don't do too many updates so I
