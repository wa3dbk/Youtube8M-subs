 I bring you a tweet that will serve you 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.460
 to play YouTube in the background 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.769
 that is, if you put a list 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.449
 of music playback for example and 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.130
 they want while being on facebook now 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.859
 with this tweet they will be able to 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.039
 Youtube's native application cuts the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.080
 sound and video automatically when 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.800
 we minimize the application the tweet is 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.719

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.850
 We have some options 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.339

 that is audio ine blair background that 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.879
 It serves for just what I finish 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.639
 to say after they have other options 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.670
 such as putting the keyboard blank and 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:54.679
 others I recommend only that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.840
