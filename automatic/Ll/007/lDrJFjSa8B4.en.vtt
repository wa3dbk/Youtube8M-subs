that as a trend statement and it works
beautifully<00:01:36.130> for<00:01:36.460> makeup<00:01:36.909> because<00:01:37.240> when

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
beautifully for makeup because when

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
it now it's absolute monochrome so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800 
it now it's absolute monochrome so
monochrome<00:02:04.009> already<00:02:04.340> meant<00:02:04.579> not<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.659> much

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
monochrome already meant not so much

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.259 
monochrome already meant not so much
color<00:02:06.110> one<00:02:07.009> designer<00:02:07.340> wanted<00:02:07.729> some<00:02:07.880> color<00:02:08.090> on

the set the other wanted her to be
gothic<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.450> minimum<00:02:12.069> making<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.160> meld<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.450 
Brandon he will say four beautiful
surgery<00:02:38.130> curses<00:02:38.970> full<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.420> money<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.130> think

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
surgery curses full of money but I think

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.640 
surgery curses full of money but I think
that<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:42.120> imbibed<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.200> monochrome

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that they really imbibed the monochrome

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
that they really imbibed the monochrome
philosophy<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.460> there's<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.850> lot<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> black<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
philosophy so there's a lot of black and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.510 
philosophy so there's a lot of black and
white<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.800> edginess<00:02:47.190> of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
white but I think it's the edginess of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.490 
white but I think it's the edginess of
the<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.270> concept<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.840> will<00:02:49.020> really<00:02:49.260> come

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the of the concept that will really come

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.080 
the of the concept that will really come
alive<00:02:49.740> with<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> grand<00:02:50.220> finale<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.850> there'll

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
alive with the grand finale and there'll

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.550 
alive with the grand finale and there'll
be<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.240> lot<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.600> color<00:02:51.780> blocking<00:02:52.020> unsure

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
be a lot of color blocking unsure

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.740 
be a lot of color blocking unsure
