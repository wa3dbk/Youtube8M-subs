factory seconds so i saved a good chunk

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.079 
factory seconds so i saved a good chunk
of<00:00:56.769> money<00:00:56.890> because<00:00:57.280> normally<00:00:57.699> these<00:00:57.820> are

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
of money because normally these are

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.130 
of money because normally these are
about<00:00:58.300> 325<00:00:59.109> to<00:00:59.320> 350<00:00:59.829> dollars<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.670> i<00:01:01.629> bought

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
about 325 to 350 dollars and i bought

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.450 
about 325 to 350 dollars and i bought
them<00:01:02.350> for<00:01:02.559> about<00:01:02.679> a<00:01:02.769> hundred<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.160> seventy

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
them for about a hundred and seventy

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.650 
them for about a hundred and seventy
five<00:01:03.489> dollars<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.210> i<00:01:04.239> thought<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.540> was<00:01:04.629> a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
five dollars so i thought that was a

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.340 
five dollars so i thought that was a
good<00:01:04.839> deal<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.050> i<00:01:05.260> couldn't<00:01:05.620> pass<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:05.890> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
good deal that i couldn't pass up and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.380 
good deal that i couldn't pass up and
decided<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.380> go<00:01:08.560> ahead<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:10.119> know<00:01:10.210> buy

leather on the toe and that's really

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.080 
leather on the toe and that's really
about<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:25.240> terms<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.840> any<00:01:26.409> defects<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.939> when

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
about it in terms of any defects so when

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.999

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
know the factory didn't bother to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.800 
know the factory didn't bother to
beautify<00:01:35.590> them<00:01:35.829> or<00:01:35.950> anything<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.420> simply

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
beautify them or anything but I simply

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.170 
beautify them or anything but I simply
polished<00:01:38.380> i<00:01:38.500> simply<00:01:39.040> dusted<00:01:39.460> them<00:01:39.610> off<00:01:39.790> and

as<00:01:42.759> good<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.210> brand-new<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.200> was<00:01:44.500> very<00:01:44.649> happy

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
as good as brand-new so I was very happy

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.219 
as good as brand-new so I was very happy
with<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.219> deal<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:45.759> anyway<00:01:46.659> as<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.049> see

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
with that deal but anyway as you can see

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.200

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.150 
certainly even at the full retail price
cheaper<00:02:28.390> than<00:02:28.569> all<00:02:28.750> than<00:02:28.959> indie<00:02:29.230> boots<00:02:29.440> or<00:02:29.890> any

other Alden boots you know at all but

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.410 
other Alden boots you know at all but
the<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.610> craftsmanship<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.180> still

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the you know the craftsmanship is still

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.170 
the you know the craftsmanship is still
quite<00:02:34.690> quite<00:02:34.900> good<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.200> these<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.819> know<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:36.970> few

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
quite quite good on these you know a few

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.880 
quite quite good on these you know a few
little<00:02:37.330> things<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.659> I<00:02:37.780> noticed<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.379> terms<00:02:38.409> of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
little things that I noticed in terms of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.619 
little things that I noticed in terms of
the<00:02:39.040> stitching<00:02:39.370> especially<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> sole<00:02:40.300> is

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
the stitching especially on the sole is

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.199 
the stitching especially on the sole is
that<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.920> stitching<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.459> sole<00:02:42.760> out<00:02:42.849> kind

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
that the stitching on the sole out kind

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.390 
that the stitching on the sole out kind
of<00:02:43.239> protrudes<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:43.959> from<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> sole<00:02:45.010> whereas

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
of protrudes out from the sole whereas

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.149 
of protrudes out from the sole whereas
on<00:02:45.610> Alden<00:02:46.120> boots<00:02:46.560> there's<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.650> little<00:02:47.890> groove

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
on Alden boots there's a little groove

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.449 
on Alden boots there's a little groove
where<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.670> stitching<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:50.050> place<00:02:50.709> or<00:02:51.069> put

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
where the stitching is in place or put

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.369 
where the stitching is in place or put
in<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.599> know<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> think<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.989> stitching<00:02:53.319> on

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
in so you know I think the stitching on

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.710 
in so you know I think the stitching on
this<00:02:53.560> might<00:02:53.739> wear<00:02:54.040> out<00:02:54.220> faster<00:02:55.209> or<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.390> soles

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
this might wear out faster or the soles

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.089 
this might wear out faster or the soles
might<00:02:55.989> wear<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.290> little<00:02:56.560> bit<00:02:56.650> faster<00:02:57.040> on

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
might wear out a little bit faster on

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.100 
might wear out a little bit faster on
these<00:02:57.280> although<00:02:57.670> I'm<00:02:57.909> not<00:02:58.030> 100%<00:02:58.390> sure<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.989> that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
these although I'm not 100% sure on that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.559 
these although I'm not 100% sure on that
but<00:02:59.470> they<00:03:00.190> certainly<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.670> seem<00:03:00.970> very<00:03:01.209> sturdy

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
but they certainly do seem very sturdy

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.360 
but they certainly do seem very sturdy
and<00:03:01.780> again<00:03:02.409> they're<00:03:02.560> very<00:03:02.590> comfortable<00:03:03.250> to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and again they're very comfortable to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750 
and again they're very comfortable to
wear<00:03:03.400> as<00:03:03.849> well<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:05.230> that's<00:03:05.980> my<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> quick<00:03:06.519> mini

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
wear as well so that's my a quick mini

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.619 
wear as well so that's my a quick mini
