00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
really complicated because I used all

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950 
really complicated because I used all
sorts<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.610> different<00:01:05.820> markers<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.479> pens<00:01:06.689> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this one for most of the line work I use

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
this one for most of the line work I use
these<00:01:09.630> Stabler<00:01:11.030> pigment<00:01:12.030> liners<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> can

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
these Stabler pigment liners as you can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
these Stabler pigment liners as you can
see<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> came<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> actual

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
see and but when it came to the actual

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
see and but when it came to the actual
coloring<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.680> used<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.220> sorts<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.549> different

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
