00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello welcome to the board 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.040
 In this class I will talk about the code 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.189
 genetic in front and showed it to you 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.390
 the messenger RNA that has crack 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.300
 nitrogenous bases called rondon 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.750
 each strand is related to a 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.240
 amino acid that is transported up to and 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.100
 messenger by means of an is 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.440
 Conveyor that has the anti-cordon 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.370
 complementary to the cordon this relationship 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.590
 between the cotton and the amino acid 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.790
 the genetic code 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.219
 In this class I brought this table 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.309
 relating the gifts to each one 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.379
 of the 20 existing amino acids 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.469
 it's like a dictionary that 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.020
 translated the language of the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.949
 nitrogen to the language of the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.509
 amino acids and this table is organized 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.000
 in the following way 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.660
 in this row I have the four bases 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.630
 nitrogenated by the cila cytosine adenine 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.640
 and guanine which may form part of the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 first position of cabbage 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.649
 in this case the girl is in that row 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.289
 higher 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.050
 I have the four bases that can do 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.979
 part in the second position of the cotton 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.080
 in this case the cytokine and in this other 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.990
 row I have the four bases 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.179
 nitrogen which may form part of the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.649
 third position of the cabbage 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:45.920
 in this case to cure these combinations and 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:51.080
 allow a total of 104 bodies 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.030
 different in this 64 3 do not codify 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:01.520
 no amino acids 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:07.130
 are they the good pictures the a-ha the a1gp the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.709
 cotton or g1 to that scorpions signal the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.390
 end in translation 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.560
 in the messenger then of the 64 me 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.430
 61 codons remaining 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.620
 can be 20 amino acids as the number 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.910
 of co2 is higher than the number of 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.590
 amino acids 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.790
 one of the characteristics of the code 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.790
 is that it is redundant or 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.610
 degenerate or is an amino acid potter 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 encoded by more than one string on 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.530
 This is the case, for example, in the case of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.620
 phenylalanine which encodes nothing by 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 two charge leucine differently than 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.350
 codified by six different rooms and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.190
 also the case of this example here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.360
 the code is coded the four codes 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.110
 many different 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.630
 today is ceo ogc 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.299
 g1 og 100 g 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.239
 this condition does not happen for two 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.790
 amino acids are they who painted fano 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.170
 which is encoded only by col gege 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.000
 and methionine which is encoded only 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.850
 by colon and oge this code also 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.549
 signals the beginning of translation 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.250
 in the messenger another 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.980
 characteristic of the genetic code is that 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.430
 it is universal ie this relation 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.190
 between cob homs and amino acids is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.370
 any organism on the planet for 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.359
 example, this messenger encodes the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.329
 following sequence of amino acids at 1g a 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:53.400
 or g1 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:04:05.040
 the girl today I g 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 the ccg know c &amp; g the science in the message 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.959
 he was in a human being in a 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.000
 bacteria on a cockroach 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.989
 it can get this string of 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.209
 amino acids for any of them 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.600
 I hope you have an understanding of this. 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.050
 class and now that they already know the type of 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.169
 rn that I presented in the previous and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.740
 know the genetic code in the next 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.949
 Class, I'll talk about it. 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.949
 of proteins do not lose and even more
