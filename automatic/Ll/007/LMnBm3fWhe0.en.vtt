nice<00:01:26.000> because<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.899> highest<00:01:27.140> where

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
nice because that's the highest where

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.679 
nice because that's the highest where
area<00:01:27.950> as<00:01:28.100> well<00:01:28.640> as<00:01:28.850> having<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.210> overlay

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
area as well as having that overlay

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.359 
area as well as having that overlay
stretch<00:01:30.020> into<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.320> fingers<00:01:30.770> which<00:01:31.250> I

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
stretch into the fingers which I

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.399 
stretch into the fingers which I
particularly<00:01:31.789> like<00:01:31.939> as<00:01:32.119> well<00:01:32.360> on<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.140> thumb

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
particularly like as well on the thumb

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.349 
particularly like as well on the thumb
has<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.649> nice<00:01:33.890> overlay<00:01:34.460> on<00:01:34.609> it<00:01:34.820> as<00:01:34.969> well<00:01:35.299> so

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
has a nice overlay on it as well so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.490 
has a nice overlay on it as well so
that's<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.810> give<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.229> said

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
that's going to give like I said

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.529 
that's going to give like I said
extended<00:01:36.979> durability<00:01:37.369> as<00:01:37.759> well<00:01:38.180> as<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.329> nice

extended durability as well as that nice
soft<00:01:38.840> feel<00:01:39.009> as<00:01:40.009> far<00:01:40.219> as<00:01:40.310> gussets<00:01:40.700> go<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:40.880> have

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
soft feel as far as gussets go you have

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.639 
soft feel as far as gussets go you have
that<00:01:41.210> mesh<00:01:41.479> material<00:01:41.719> there<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.439> that's<00:01:42.500> going

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
that mesh material there so that's going

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.830 
that mesh material there so that's going
to<00:01:42.740> increase<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.340> airflow<00:01:43.520> I'm<00:01:44.030> keeping<00:01:44.750> the
