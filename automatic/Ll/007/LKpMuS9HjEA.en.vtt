00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
out and they put it out early for a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.720 
out and they put it out early for a
analyst<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> Walmart<00:00:46.380> exclusive<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.250> can

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
analyst for a Walmart exclusive you can

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
analyst for a Walmart exclusive you can
see<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> sticker<00:00:48.150> right<00:00:48.210> there

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
see the sticker right there

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.400 
see the sticker right there
but<00:00:50.879> Amazon<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.720> still<00:00:51.900> has<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
but Amazon I think still has it for

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
but Amazon I think still has it for
pre-orders<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.489> preorder<00:00:53.790> from

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pre-orders so if you preorder from

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.210 
pre-orders so if you preorder from
Amazon<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.780> won't<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.200> it<00:00:55.320> until<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.769> Amazon
