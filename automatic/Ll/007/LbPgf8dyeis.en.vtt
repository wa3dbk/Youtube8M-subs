00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.999
 hello and welcome to another video tutorial 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.430
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:10.610
 leave paper by technique 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.629
 origami 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.629
 pretty truth 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.510
 let's see what we need 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.789
 we will need a square sheet of paper 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.400
 of the color they want the sword 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.090
 let's start by doubling down the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.650
 diagonal 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.850
 a diagonal 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.809
 we open 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 and another diagonal 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.060
 we must stay the diagonals well 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 I've gone a little bit here in this 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 tip 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 we open and now we are going to double 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
 half 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460
 A) Yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.229
 open we turn and turn on the other 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.229
 half 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 we open it we put it in this position and 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.340
 we are going to take this tip to this central 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 A) Yes 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.360
 and this point to the center too 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.260
 now we turn it around 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.030
 and we are going to take this side to this line 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.659
 central 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.659
 A) Yes 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.790
 we get this out of here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.539
 and we mark 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.910
 and we now take this side to this line 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.910
 central too 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.510
 we get this out of here 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.510
 and we mark 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.100
 Now let's take this little tip to this 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.569
 center here 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.390
 So what we do is hide the paper 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.040
 and we do the same thing here we take 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 this tip is here 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 well we should have something like this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 we put the paper in this position and 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.050
 let's take this tip 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.650
 here to this point here 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.650
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.240
 we mark very well and now we are going to 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.340
 catch it and fold 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.340
 well more or less 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.130
 this gives me a centimeter and a little bit 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.900
 plus 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.930
 it will be 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.840
 what separates the blade from the sword 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.580
 mango 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.580
 so that's how 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.810
 keep in mind that we have to stay 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.810
 this and this 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.530
 well now let's make the mango we have 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.530
 that put it in this position the sword 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.980
 and we take this side to this line 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.980
 central 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.600
 and now we have a problem 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.980
 we put it in this position held 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.750
 strong with your finger and we give it here and 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.710
 we are crushing 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.610
 well so until we have it 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.100
 in this way 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.709
 if we lower our payments and go to 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.380
 do the same thing on this side we carry 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.380
 this side to the center like this 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.419
 now we hold strong we put it in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.800
 this position so that they see it we put 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.389
 the little finger here 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.340
 This is going to be a little more complicated 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.340
 because the paper is attacked 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.210
 and we are going to crush 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.780
 we open it a little bit we do it with the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.440
 finger 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.440
 we return to bend we hold strong 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:05:01.509
 well and we're crushing there 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.509
 and we should have something like this 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.870
 now let's double 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.870
 up this line here 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.340
 we fold like this 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.290
 and now we double 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.290
 in half this side we bring it here 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.909
 and it will remain that way 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.430
 and it's almost ready and it seems like the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.480
 fairies now let's make the sheet more 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.450
 fine 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.520
 we put it aside and we take this side 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.360
 to the center 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.969
 A) Yes 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.460
 we mark very well 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:55.259
 we separated a little and we are listening 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.259
 we cut the paper a little 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.180
 it's going to be a little doubled because 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.210
 we have not put this part as soon as 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.660
 let's put this part it gets straight those 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.170
 we turn and do the same thing this side to 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.170
 center 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:26.550
 and now we are going to force the 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.550
 paper like that and we crush 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.340
 and we have our sword 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.380
 because this has been everything I hope that you 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.480
 have liked and can war 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.800
 They are many 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.800
 until the next video
