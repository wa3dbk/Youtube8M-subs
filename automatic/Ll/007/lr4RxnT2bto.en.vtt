speaking of the loop let's take a look
at<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> said<00:00:46.230> six<00:00:46.469> storeys<00:00:46.829> tall

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
at what it is I said six storeys tall

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
at what it is I said six storeys tall
well<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.360> massive<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.020> can't<00:00:49.260> believe

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
well it's so massive you can't believe

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.139 
well it's so massive you can't believe
it<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.309> far<00:00:50.370> away<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it if you see it from far away it just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
it if you see it from far away it just
stands<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.829> close<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stands out when you see it up close it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.240 
stands out when you see it up close it
is<00:00:53.850> frightening<00:00:54.320> 500<00:00:55.320> gallons<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.770> hot<00:00:55.949> wheels

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is frightening 500 gallons of hot wheels

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.869 
is frightening 500 gallons of hot wheels
orange<00:00:56.879> eight<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:58.050> truly<00:00:58.710> amazing<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.579> take

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
orange eight it is truly amazing to take

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.709 
orange eight it is truly amazing to take
a<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.820> something

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a look at as you can see it is something

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.280 
a look at as you can see it is something
to<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.379> grasp<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.570> said<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.049> for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to really grasp and as we said just for

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
to really grasp and as we said just for
fun<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> add<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> jump<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> end

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fun we're going to add a jump at the end

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.270 
fun we're going to add a jump at the end
of<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.189> about

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
of it and so what you got to think about

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
of it and so what you got to think about
is<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> both<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.330> cars<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is that both of these cars are going to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.429 
is that both of these cars are going to
merge<00:01:13.409> somewhere<00:01:14.400> inside<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.180> loop<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
merge somewhere inside this loop so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
merge somewhere inside this loop so
we've<00:01:16.830> been<00:01:16.950> talking<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.640> no<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.509> all

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
we've been talking about no but it's all

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.050 
we've been talking about no but it's all
about<00:01:19.229> preparation<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.159> science
