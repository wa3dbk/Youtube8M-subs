 we installed life and once the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.430
 well we are here we are in the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 desktop and we have the application 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 open once opened we do not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.070
 we have to complicate our lives a lot 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.290
 He is telling us what the application 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 we have to do visually we 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.730
 put step 1 connect the device step 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.770
 2 give it to scan and step 3 directly 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 give it to clean well let's do what 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.610
 next we are going to connect the iphone to 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 computer 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.330
 ok we have already plugged the iphone into 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.160
 computer and we have left this menu in 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.780
 this menu we can see the data of 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.610
 our iphone specifically iphone 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 fernando in the capacity of the iphone the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 used space and free space is worth 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.760
 then here we can also choose what 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 type of documents we want this 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.910
 scanner program to be able to do the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
 cleaning I just did a cleaning 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.700
 to test this program therefore 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 surely give me the result 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 totally empty but let's see 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.000
 to analyze we give to analyze and how 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.979
 you see the application starts to do as 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 a scanner for all folders by 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.250
 all the documents you find 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.050
 inside our device this 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 application as I say it comes in handy for 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.020
 all those users who do not have 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.310
 jailbreak and can not enjoy 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 fantastic apps like 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.180
 example leans as you see I'm 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.770
 finishing the scanner I do not have to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.570
 clean anything because I adjust moments 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 before doing this video I just did 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.070
 the scanner and I just did the cleaning 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.120
 and my iphone has released 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.220
 quite a lot of megas I think around 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.410
 100 meg or 200 had been consumed 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.880
 consumed enough space which for 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.950
 good this space always free it 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
 it comes very well and this is what it does 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.300
 this application as you see font clean is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.860
 a fantastic application that you 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.040
 I advise and that you can download in the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.500
