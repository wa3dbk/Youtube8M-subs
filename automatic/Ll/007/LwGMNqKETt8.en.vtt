something<00:01:41.790> along<00:01:41.970> those<00:01:42.030> lines<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.780> there's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
something along those lines but there's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.679 
something along those lines but there's
nothing<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:45.000> only<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> rifle

nice<00:03:09.260> um<00:03:10.420> things<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.569> think<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.870> could<00:03:11.959> have

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
nice um things I think that could have

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.330 
nice um things I think that could have
been<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.170> little<00:03:12.290> bit<00:03:12.439> better<00:03:12.590> his<00:03:13.069> arm

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
been a little bit better his arm

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.210 
been a little bit better his arm
obviously<00:03:13.849> needs<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.209> be<00:03:14.799> fixed<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.129> bit

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
obviously needs to be fixed a little bit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.080 
obviously needs to be fixed a little bit
better<00:03:16.340> but<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.609> could<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.790> be<00:03:16.970> mine<00:03:17.239> um<00:03:17.829> I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
better but that could just be mine um I

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.369 
better but that could just be mine um I
would<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.120> liked<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.329> seen<00:03:20.599> his<00:03:20.780> rifle<00:03:21.230> have

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
would have liked to seen his rifle have

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.949 
would have liked to seen his rifle have
a<00:03:21.410> peg<00:03:21.650> when<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:22.730> pull<00:03:22.970> his<00:03:23.209> laser<00:03:23.449> pistols

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
a peg when you pull his laser pistols

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.990 
a peg when you pull his laser pistols
out<00:03:24.079> or<00:03:24.829> whatever<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:25.370> little<00:03:25.609> pistols<00:03:25.879> are

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
out or whatever these little pistols are

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.240 
out or whatever these little pistols are
they're<00:03:26.690> rubber<00:03:26.959> banded<00:03:27.349> into<00:03:27.560> his<00:03:27.680> hands<00:03:28.129> if

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
they're rubber banded into his hands if

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.119 
they're rubber banded into his hands if
you<00:03:28.400> don't<00:03:28.430> want<00:03:28.879> them<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.090> his<00:03:29.209> holsters<00:03:29.659> and

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
you don't want them in his holsters and

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.289 
you don't want them in his holsters and
you<00:03:31.129> don't<00:03:31.280> want<00:03:31.400> them<00:03:31.489> holding<00:03:31.730> his<00:03:31.819> rifle

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
you don't want them holding his rifle

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.030 
you don't want them holding his rifle
I<00:03:32.329> would<00:03:33.079> leave<00:03:33.199> those<00:03:33.379> rubber<00:03:33.530> bands<00:03:33.799> on

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
I would leave those rubber bands on

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.640 
I would leave those rubber bands on
because<00:03:34.519> um<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.389> can<00:03:35.540> get<00:03:35.659> the<00:03:35.750> pistols<00:03:36.500> back

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
because um you can get the pistols back

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.220 
because um you can get the pistols back
into<00:03:37.010> his<00:03:37.099> hands<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:38.840> stay<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.079> little

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
into his hands but they stay a little

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.789 
into his hands but they stay a little
bit<00:03:39.349> better<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:41.229> rubber<00:03:42.229> bands<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.650> them

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
bit better with the rubber bands on them

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.170 
bit better with the rubber bands on them
so<00:03:43.609> campaigns<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.269> solid<00:03:44.569> figure<00:03:44.900> um<00:03:45.970> Star<00:03:46.970> Wars

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180
