00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
684 point one zero if you read the two

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.900 
684 point one zero if you read the two
numbers<00:04:20.480> now<00:04:20.750> digit<00:04:21.530> by<00:04:21.680> digit<00:04:21.739> they<00:04:22.640> are<00:04:22.790> the

right of 684 point one if two books have
the<00:04:35.630> exact<00:04:35.990> same<00:04:36.110> call<00:04:36.620> number<00:04:36.650> shelve

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
the exact same call number shelve

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.940 
the exact same call number shelve
according<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.510> cutter<00:04:38.750> number<00:04:38.960> the

according to the cutter number the

according to the cutter number the
cutter<00:04:40.220> number<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:40.820> most<00:04:41.180> often<00:04:41.480> the<00:04:41.690> author's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
cutter number is most often the author's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.460 
cutter number is most often the author's
last<00:04:42.500> name<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.610> will<00:04:43.820> shove<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.240> books

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
last name so you will shove the books

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.620 
last name so you will shove the books
alphabetically<00:04:45.470> by<00:04:45.770> author<00:04:46.010> last<00:04:46.430> name<00:04:46.760> you
