00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey everyone so this is a video on how I

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey everyone so this is a video on how I
think<00:00:03.959> it's<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.170> best<00:00:04.319> way<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.950> partial

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
think it's the best way to do partial

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.570 
think it's the best way to do partial
sew<00:00:06.120> ins<00:00:06.390> or<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.899> between<00:00:07.049> tracks<00:00:07.589> as<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.400> can

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
see that you have the perimeter of the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.720 
see that you have the perimeter of the
person's<00:00:11.130> hair<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.150> you're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
start the other braid on the other side
and<00:00:39.270> braid<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> same<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.649> bring<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
down and let it meet in the middle of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
down and let it meet in the middle of

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
go on over there but that's what I'm

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.660 
go on over there but that's what I'm
doing<00:01:53.530> what<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.800> comb<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.160> pushing<00:01:54.550> it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
doing what the comb is pushing it

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.790 
doing what the comb is pushing it
through<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.210> pulling<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.020> over<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.650> it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
through and pulling it over and it's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.859 
through and pulling it over and it's
best<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.190> probably<00:01:57.550> use<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.060> crochet<00:01:58.540> needle

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
best to probably use the crochet needle

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.260 
best to probably use the crochet needle
but<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.170> don't<00:01:59.350> have<00:01:59.530> one<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.729> do<00:02:01.090> this

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
but I don't have one and I just do this

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.050 
but I don't have one and I just do this
all<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.570> way<00:02:01.810> till<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.170> get<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.399> top<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.970> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
all the way till I get to the top and I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.620 
all the way till I get to the top and I
do<00:02:04.119> about<00:02:04.649> three<00:02:05.649> brace<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:06.399> this<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.940> I'm

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
do about three brace for this and I'm

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.199
