00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 I spoke to people here and talking to them. 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:16.580
 as you know the current terminal of the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.580
 modern warfare 2 was released for Fashion 93 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 something like that yesterday and I do not know if 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 You know, but there's a curiosity. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 very cool is the factor without being able to upload 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.830
 on this plane and a lot of people know that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.890
 how to climb but do not know how to climb people 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.120
 you do not even know you have to consume 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 Anyway, how it's very simple is fine. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.000
 easier than trendy makes two alias 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.710
 The way is the same, but here it is bigger in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.870
 door that is easier for you to hit 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.410
 nor w3 than on Sunday 2 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.969
 so come on, you will run here and 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 between the aircraft door 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.930
 You will run and you will tighten space and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.850
 You'll be stuck here on top of the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 door 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 This you will not get every time you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 I got there that you will fall, but at last 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 one hour you 'll hit up here and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 when you can you are seeing 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 this letter faith this letter l 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.000
 because it is between you will look between one and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.400
 one more or less so in the middle where 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.710
 bullet bullet jobs 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.070
 you will look more references there are here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.850
 will jump and will squeeze at the same 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.009
 time press space then press s 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 and that is to the left and back to the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.540
 same time as not the three of them at the same time 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.420
 time but first you jump after the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.490
 question is whether it is at the same time to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 climbing here is a bit more difficult than it is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.079
 more difficult than going up the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.310
 even w3 or w2 is easier to upload 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.140
 than going up to the door but it 's very 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.590
 simple you have to jump here where 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 is this brand of speech right here you? 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.159
 it's going to hit 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 in this higher part without realizing more 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.240
 has relief alone in this part of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.190
 behind the plane and it ends here 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.930
 from this part of the idesp tone it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 a flag starts 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.680
 so you have to jump more often here 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.209
 How can you talk from here? 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.890
 only the way I'm going to show that 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.560
 It may be easier to find people who think 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.450
 easier to touch here and popular yes 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.209
 but I can not even the way that I 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.150
 I think it's easier that way so you look 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.010
 at you run here and that works 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 mark you jump and then when you fall 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.590
 popular that you fall right above you 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.320
 will run in that direction ie you 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.150
 jumps here and runs up here you have to 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.100
 jump right to left for 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.560
 right when you reach the point when 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.540
 you're here, it's not only you fall here already 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 ready you will turn to that side and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.820
 shake shift fast and you're done 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.340
 It's going to fall on top, I'm going to come back here. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.050
 in the edition a little bit for you to see 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.050
 in slow motion as you climb here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 anyway this is not a place to 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.120
 Campinas, there's no way you can not get 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.730
 here even because you will not ever go 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.159
 To be able to hide on top is to 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.650
 who the same mall actress is a sport 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.329
 well cool and finally the video stayed here 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.390
 the sector was just that 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.430
 and if you liked help and click the license 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 If you liked it a lot when favorite and 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.930
