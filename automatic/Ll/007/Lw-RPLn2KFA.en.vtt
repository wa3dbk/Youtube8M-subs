00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.090

 of the mouth and tongue are 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.940
 extraordinary and they have many 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.070
 senses in Ecuador as in 90% of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.630

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.719
 violators are fined with money and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.929
 even putting them to jail for 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.240

 this Thai couple achieved in 2011 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.179
 when we kiss, they get involved 12 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.610
 facial muscles one of them is the 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.350
 orbicular muscle of the mouth that allows 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.899
 produce lips like a baby 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.819
 drinking milk in ancient cultures the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.920
 mothers chewed food for their 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.750
 small children and they passed them to the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.819
 mouth this is the first track 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.039
 we have of the origins of the kiss between 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.110
 lovers the earliest references 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.509
 we have them from texts of writings of the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.119
 india about 1500 years before Christ 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.329
 but what types of kisses know the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.239
 French with the tongue involved the kiss 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.280
 romantic the passionate and sensual 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.550
 for example kiss you do not give mother the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 kiss that we give to our partner 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.950
 to our children the one on the cheek that is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.750
 more like something traditional in health 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.670
 let's start by defining the little piquito is a 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.770
 light kiss where the lips only arrive 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.520
 to bump into but under what circumstances two 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.350
 individuals are given a peak bother 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.170
 hesitate in a bet for example 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.000
 hesitate I do not know how the first kiss that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.550
 closed a person was throw a peak 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.960
 there is the French kiss known for being 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.930
 passionate since the tongue is used a lot 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.850
 romantic when you have confidence with 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.410
 that person and what if we talk about 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.640
 kiss of death known 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.010
 mainly in the sacred 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 scriptures when judas betrayed 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.750
 Jesus is represented with a kiss on the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.180
 cheek there is the kiss of synchronizing 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.610
 in which one of the two seeks only one 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.730
 peak and the other simply abused the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.730
 trust 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.269
 the stolen kiss is another one of the most 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.879
 common mainly in the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.250
 adolescence almost like a game to see if 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.560
 sometimes to the boy or the girl so that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.540
 leave with you but there are good and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.090
 bad experiences with this kind of kiss 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.129
 they catch you from unforeseen 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.640
 you feel something for that person but not 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.680
 this row that will give you then 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.760
 been just must be more than mutual 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.260
 agreement does not know how one will react 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.200
 the other person if it comes in that 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.300
 directly uncomfortable plan because I do not know 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.110
 waiting for the convenience of apology 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.110
 derogatory 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.640
 but there are also those you do not see 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.010
 that if you want to steal one you have to be 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.470
 faster because if you could sidestep 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.410
 be worse the situation for you and sometimes 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.060
 a kiss can be terrible if so 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.739
 first time because he did not know how to kiss and was 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.099
 like there's now that I do that was 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.099
 with flu 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:09.989
 and we had the bad luck to touch the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:12.329
 teeth and being good or bad in 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.459
 Each kiss couples share 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.229
 bacteria from their mouths it is estimated that 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.720
 about a kiss of 10 seconds 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.220
 It transmits about 80 million 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160
 microorganisms 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.290
 as I listen to 80 million people 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.360
 they are exchanged in a minimum time 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.430
 which help us with digestion and 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 fight microorganisms foreign to the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.960
 human body but can the kisses and the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.090
 Saliva exchange be dangerous 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.190
 for our health and you have for example 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.020
 the herpes virus with what we 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.450
 we know how the fires simply 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.670
 by the touch of the lips that have the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.530
 fire can transmit this as the 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.480
 flu that we have the most common if 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.400
 can get the flu by kissing if 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.830
 a person has gingivitis this is 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.570
 production by bacteria if you see it 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.090
 a person who does not have gingivitis 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.850
 you are going to spread the disease 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.860
 kiss his scientific name is 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.930
 infectious mononucleosis regularly not 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.240
 it is serious but the patient could 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.610
 present fever headache or 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.680
 rashes although in adults of 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.720
 these diseases could be transient 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.120
 according to the specialists you have to have 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.880
 greater care with children under 5 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.180
 years children are not owed or kissed 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.830
 or give them kisses worse in the mouth because 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.870
 you are transmitting you all your 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.030
 matters and a newborn a child 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.720
 less than 5 years old will not have the same 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.600
 matters that you have throughout your life 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.460
 connected in your mouth 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.070
 but you know what happens in your body 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.110
 when you kiss our lips have 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.600
 many nerves and the skin is very thin 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.550
 the somatosensory cortex of the brain 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.320
 Deliver more space to our lips 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.120
 that to our genitals good 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.770
 typically what it generates in the being 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.300
 human are the endorphins and everything 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.300
 finished hÃ©nin so it makes you happy 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.280
 endorphins make you happy when 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.160
 you eat chocolate but it's much better 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.030
 when you kiss there are people who can 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.460
 to have 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.680
 unused pleasures only through 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.130
 of the kiss from there that comes from the kiss 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.780
 it is a sublime expression in the brain 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.030
 substances like the 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.670
 oxytocin hormone related to 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.280
 sexual patterns or endorphins the 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.260
 dopamine the serotonin known as 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.630
 the hormones of happiness while 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.080
 we kiss the body produces less than 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.400
 the stress hormone called cortisol 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.770
 for all this set of reactions 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.800
 both physical and chemical is that 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.750
 there are kisses that make history like 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.730
 kiss of the lovers of time square in 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.220

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.810
 nurse thus celebrated the end of the 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.430
 WWII 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.490

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.860
 Pop Madonna with Britney Spears and 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.860
 christina aguilera 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.740
 in this compilation can not miss the 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.069
 Kisses from movies like the meeting 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.300
 between humphrey bogart and ingrid bergman and 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.219

 East Germany and Leonidas Brezhnev

 the Soviet Union despite the controversy and 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.270
 the ridicule that unleashed in the West was 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.020
 really a common sign of solidarity 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.020
 socialist 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.519
 celebrate the day of the kiss is only 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.039
 a symbolic act what is really 

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:39.289
 important is to kiss our beloved 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.199
 with passion and delivery since it is good 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:44.330
 for our physical and emotional health not 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:47.599
 you necessarily need to kiss you in 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:51.289
 long but yes very much you see your partner 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:53.509
 every day every day so 

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.639
 less once intensely and I'm 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:08:00.469
 speaking with tongue because the little 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:08:03.319
 of the piquito as it becomes very common and 

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:06.699
 it's not what the soul really needs 

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:06.699
 and the body
