okay this is your first row of water Bob
basis<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.820> help<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.330> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
basis you really help to kind of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.679 
basis you really help to kind of
collapse<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.409> themselves<00:01:26.360> onto<00:01:27.360> of

collapse them into themselves onto of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.120 
collapse them into themselves onto of
each<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.140> should<00:01:28.259> say<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:31.130> keep

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
each other I should say and then keep

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:46.790

look<00:01:47.800> shirt<00:01:48.160> all<00:01:48.370> of<00:01:48.670> these<00:01:48.790> are<00:01:49.000> tucked<00:01:49.240> in

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
look shirt all of these are tucked in

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:08.850 
look shirt all of these are tucked in
you<00:01:49.900> will<00:01:50.140> stray<00:01:50.590> right<00:01:50.800> there<00:02:06.360> okay<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:08.500> if

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
you will stray right there okay now if

you will stray right there okay now if
you<00:02:09.040> can<00:02:09.490> make<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.910> first<00:02:10.240> row<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.479> water

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
you can make this first row of water

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.290 
you can make this first row of water
bomb<00:02:11.170> bases<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:12.340> can<00:02:12.520> make<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.880> rest<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.210> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
bomb bases you can make the rest of the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.240 
bomb bases you can make the rest of the
mini<00:02:13.480> epic<00:02:13.900> ball<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.440> don't<00:02:14.620> worry<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.010> hard

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
mini epic ball so don't worry the hard

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.690 
mini epic ball so don't worry the hard
part<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.700> over<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> want<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.190> flip<00:02:18.490> these

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
part is over then I want to flip these

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
part is over then I want to flip these
and<00:02:19.060> make<00:02:19.360> these<00:02:19.600> into<00:02:20.230> valley<00:02:20.770> folds<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.510> try

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and make these into valley folds and try

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880 
and make these into valley folds and try
to<00:02:23.500> keep<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:25.020> place<00:02:26.020> right<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.470> nice<00:02:26.710> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
to keep this place right here nice to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.270 
to keep this place right here nice to
meet<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:28.230> will<00:02:29.230> reverse<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.680> valley<00:02:29.890> folds

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
meet I will reverse the valley folds

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.850 
meet I will reverse the valley folds
into<00:02:30.430> mountain<00:02:30.910> folds<00:02:31.350> which<00:02:32.350> then<00:02:32.560> become<00:02:32.830> a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
into mountain folds which then become a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.820 
into mountain folds which then become a
lot<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.250> bases<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.610> said<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.230> part<00:02:38.620> is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
lot of on bases like I said this part is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:51.800 
lot of on bases like I said this part is
very<00:02:39.100> easy<00:02:42.330> keep<00:02:43.330> reversing

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.170 

and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.260> want<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.590> collapse<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:54.940> on

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and then you want to collapse it back on

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.260 
and then you want to collapse it back on
themselves<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:57.460> do<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.850> lot<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.150> they

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
themselves you do this a lot but they

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.790 
themselves you do this a lot but they
get<00:02:58.420> very<00:02:58.660> good<00:02:58.840> Cree<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.410> way<00:02:59.560> whenever

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
get very good Cree so that way whenever

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.150 
get very good Cree so that way whenever
it's<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.820> climatic<00:03:01.330> ballpark<00:03:02.160> they

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
it's in the a climatic ballpark they

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's in the a climatic ballpark they
collapse<00:03:03.520> into<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.000> ball<00:03:04.180> very<00:03:04.420> easily<00:03:04.750> and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
collapse into the ball very easily and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.810 
collapse into the ball very easily and
it<00:03:05.650> looks<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.280> bit<00:03:06.310> nicer

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
it looks a bit nicer

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.050 
it looks a bit nicer
I<00:03:07.030> think<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:09.160> sometimes<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:09.880> little

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
I think now sometimes you have little

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.880 
I think now sometimes you have little
straight<00:03:10.810> things<00:03:11.080> like<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:11.710> you<00:03:11.860> can

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
straight things like this but you can

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.430 
straight things like this but you can
probably<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:13.510> little<00:03:13.870> knife<00:03:14.230> right

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
probably see that little knife right

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.830 
probably see that little knife right
there<00:03:14.470> isn't<00:03:14.800> perfect<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:16.360> that's<00:03:16.480> okay<00:03:16.810> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
there isn't perfect but that's okay you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.520 
there isn't perfect but that's okay you
keep<00:03:17.080> try<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.440> iron<00:03:17.680> those<00:03:17.950> out<00:03:18.190> later<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
keep try to iron those out later and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.970 
keep try to iron those out later and
like<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.830> said<00:03:20.890> sorry<00:03:21.280> I'm<00:03:21.370> gonna<00:03:21.490> do<00:03:21.700> cold<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
like I said sorry I'm gonna do cold and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.430 
like I said sorry I'm gonna do cold and
then<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.340> want<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> flip<00:03:25.000> these<00:03:25.600> back<00:03:26.050> into

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
then you want to flip these back into

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.340 
then you want to flip these back into
mountain<00:03:27.400> folds<00:03:28.590> very<00:03:29.590> easy<00:03:31.110> make<00:03:32.110> sure

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
mountain folds very easy make sure

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:57.300 
mountain folds very easy make sure
they're<00:03:33.310> nice<00:03:33.520> 1:1<00:03:34.060> basis<00:03:55.800> collapse<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:57.070> back

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
they're nice 1:1 basis collapse it back

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.430 
they're nice 1:1 basis collapse it back
all<00:03:57.520> up<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.920> seconds<00:03:59.920> last<00:04:00.130> time<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:02.170> you

all up so seconds last time if you

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.260 
all up so seconds last time if you
wanted<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.890> look<00:04:03.010> nice<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.580> really<00:04:03.880> should<00:04:04.090> do

flip<00:04:13.960> in<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.110> edges<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.830> then<00:04:14.920> flip<00:04:15.160> them

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
flip in the edges and then flip them

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.490 
flip in the edges and then flip them
back<00:04:15.310> out<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.030> we're<00:04:16.600> gonna<00:04:16.750> leave<00:04:17.320> them

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
back out because we're gonna leave them

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.430 
back out because we're gonna leave them
out<00:04:17.710> after<00:04:18.400> just<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:19.840> make<00:04:19.989> sure<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.260> they

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
out after just to make sure that they

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.980 
out after just to make sure that they
can<00:04:20.650> go<00:04:20.920> in<00:04:24.660> okay

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
can go in okay

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.790 
can go in okay
now<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:29.780> which<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.960> need<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.380> reverse

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
now we have this which I need to reverse

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.400 
now we have this which I need to reverse
these<00:04:32.640> holes<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.510> way<00:04:33.690> they<00:04:33.840> look<00:04:34.020> like<00:04:34.140> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
these holes so I way they look like this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.160 
these holes so I way they look like this
you<00:04:35.280> do<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.490> by<00:04:35.790> just<00:04:36.000> opening<00:04:36.240> up<00:04:36.690> the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
you do that by just opening up the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.860 
you do that by just opening up the
waterbomb<00:04:37.560> base

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:55.310 

simple<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.870> what<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.140> should<00:04:55.170> look

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
simple and this is what it should look

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.260

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
to reverse these things and to kind of a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.490 
to reverse these things and to kind of a
semi<00:05:04.140> of<00:05:04.260> water<00:05:04.530> bomb<00:05:05.150> now<00:05:06.150> see<00:05:07.080> if<00:05:07.170> I<00:05:07.260> can<00:05:07.410> get
