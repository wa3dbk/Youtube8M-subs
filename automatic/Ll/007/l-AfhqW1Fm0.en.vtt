00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
when I picked up the bike it was a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.030 
when I picked up the bike it was a
two-hour<00:01:16.780> ride<00:01:16.960> home<00:01:17.170> from<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.440> dealership

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.560 
two-hour ride home from the dealership
where<00:01:18.190> I<00:01:18.280> picked<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.640> up<00:01:18.730> so<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:18.970> really<00:01:19.390> got<00:01:19.540> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
where I picked it up so I really got to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.680 
where I picked it up so I really got to
experience<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.610> firsthand<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:22.120> right<00:01:22.450> after

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
experience that firsthand so right after

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.630 
experience that firsthand so right after
getting<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> bike<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.440> made<00:01:24.100> up<00:01:24.190> my<00:01:24.310> mind<00:01:24.340> that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
getting the bike I made up my mind that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.520 
getting the bike I made up my mind that
I'm<00:01:24.700> going<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.850> buy<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> windscreen<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:26.020> it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
I'm going to buy a windscreen for it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.500 
I'm going to buy a windscreen for it
even<00:01:27.159> though<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:27.370> is<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.550> naked<00:01:27.880> bike<00:01:28.090> you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
even though this is a naked bike you

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.910 
even though this is a naked bike you
know<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:28.930> makes<00:01:29.080> sense<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.530> has<00:01:29.590> all<00:01:29.830> the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
know it makes sense that it has all the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.350 
know it makes sense that it has all the
wind<00:01:30.100> blast<00:01:30.370> when<00:01:30.909> you're<00:01:31.030> doing<00:01:31.240> those

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
wind blast when you're doing those

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.480 
wind blast when you're doing those
longer<00:01:31.659> rides<00:01:31.840> it's<00:01:32.170> really<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.860> kind<00:01:33.400> of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
longer rides it's really it's kind of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.490 
longer rides it's really it's kind of
nicer<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.210> be<00:01:34.330> able<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.570> relax<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:35.110> little<00:01:35.230> bit

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
nicer to be able to relax a little bit

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.960 
nicer to be able to relax a little bit
instead<00:01:35.980> of<00:01:36.130> feel<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.340> you're<00:01:36.580> being<00:01:36.760> pushed

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
instead of feel like you're being pushed

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.540 
instead of feel like you're being pushed
off<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.390> bike<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.600> my<00:01:37.810> opinion<00:01:38.410> now<00:01:39.010> when<00:01:39.280> when

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
off the bike in my opinion now when when

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.280 
off the bike in my opinion now when when
it<00:01:39.640> first<00:01:39.850> came<00:01:40.180> out<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.570> bike<00:01:40.780> there<00:01:41.110> weren't

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
it first came out the bike there weren't

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.650 
it first came out the bike there weren't
very<00:01:41.350> many<00:01:41.560> options<00:01:41.890> for<00:01:42.190> wind<00:01:42.490> screens<00:01:42.820> they

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
very many options for wind screens they

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.630 
very many options for wind screens they
just<00:01:43.840> had<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.350> Yamaha<00:01:44.770> one<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.250> that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
just had the Yamaha one and that's

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.580 
just had the Yamaha one and that's
really<00:01:46.060> hard<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.570> your<00:01:46.690> hands<00:01:46.930> on<00:01:47.080> now

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
really hard to get your hands on now

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.500 
really hard to get your hands on now
there's<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.890> lot<00:01:48.040> more<00:01:48.220> options<00:01:48.400> I<00:01:48.850> ended<00:01:49.450> up

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
there's a lot more options I ended up

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.690 
there's a lot more options I ended up
going<00:01:49.690> with<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.020> pube<00:01:50.320> one<00:01:50.590> because<00:01:51.040> mainly

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
going with this pube one because mainly

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.910 
going with this pube one because mainly
because<00:01:52.120> of<00:01:52.270> how<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.600> looks<00:01:52.900> it's<00:01:53.530> really

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
because of how it looks it's really

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920 
because of how it looks it's really
angular<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.760> has<00:01:54.970> these<00:01:55.210> bumps<00:01:55.540> out<00:01:55.630> here<00:01:55.840> in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
angular it has these bumps out here in

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.510 
angular it has these bumps out here in
the<00:01:55.990> middle<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:57.040> think<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.370> looks

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the middle and I think it just looks

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.550 
the middle and I think it just looks
aggressive<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.510> matches<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.990> styling<00:01:59.410> of

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
aggressive and matches the styling of

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.530 
aggressive and matches the styling of
the<00:01:59.680> bike<00:01:59.920> instead<00:02:00.760> of<00:02:00.880> some<00:02:01.060> other<00:02:01.180> ones<00:02:01.450> that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
the bike instead of some other ones that

are just kind of circular and they just

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.980 
are just kind of circular and they just
did<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:04.060> my<00:02:04.150> opinion<00:02:04.450> they<00:02:04.540> don't<00:02:04.600> look<00:02:04.870> like

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
did in my opinion they don't look like

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.530 
did in my opinion they don't look like
they<00:02:05.140> fit<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.530> bike<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.670> got<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.060> darkest

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.850 
color and I got the sport version which
is<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.610> shorter<00:02:10.119> one<00:02:10.300> now<00:02:10.929> there<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.379> three

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860

in this dark and there's also a touring
version<00:02:15.519> which<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:15.970> longer<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:17.019> it<00:02:17.140> comes<00:02:17.349> up

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
version which is longer so it comes up

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.619 
version which is longer so it comes up
quite<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.739> bit<00:02:17.920> higher<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:19.180> touring

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
quite a bit higher now the touring

quite a bit higher now the touring
version<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.050> me<00:02:20.200> didn't<00:02:20.620> look<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.980> fit

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
version to me didn't look like it fit

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.949 
version to me didn't look like it fit
the<00:02:21.310> bike<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:22.090> looked<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.480> little<00:02:22.599> bit<00:02:22.780> out<00:02:22.930> of

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
the bike it looked a little bit out of

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.369 
the bike it looked a little bit out of
place<00:02:23.290> kind<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.739> funny<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.720> decided<00:02:26.050> to

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
place kind of funny and so I decided to

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.440 
place kind of funny and so I decided to
go<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.739> one<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.910> wasn't<00:02:28.209> sure<00:02:28.420> on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
go with this one and I wasn't sure on

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.150 
go with this one and I wasn't sure on
the<00:02:28.690> colors<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.230> was<00:02:29.319> hard<00:02:29.530> for<00:02:29.590> me<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.920> choose

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
the colors it was hard for me to choose

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.490 
the colors it was hard for me to choose
either<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.519> could<00:02:30.610> go<00:02:30.849> clear<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.410> of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
either I could go clear so kind of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
either I could go clear so kind of
pretend<00:02:33.069> that's<00:02:33.160> not<00:02:33.370> there<00:02:33.670> medium<00:02:34.660> or<00:02:34.870> this

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
pretend that's not there medium or this

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.839 
pretend that's not there medium or this
dark<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.680> very<00:02:35.890> happy<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.550> went<00:02:36.760> with

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
dark and I'm very happy that I went with

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.000 
dark and I'm very happy that I went with
the<00:02:36.940> dark<00:02:37.180> because<00:02:37.659> it<00:02:38.109> just<00:02:38.290> really<00:02:38.499> matches

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the dark because it just really matches

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.339 
the dark because it just really matches
the<00:02:39.129> black<00:02:39.340> plastics<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.269> at<00:02:40.900> first<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.200> wasn't

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the black plastics and at first I wasn't

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.080 
the black plastics and at first I wasn't
sure<00:02:41.590> how<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.829> liked<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.400> look<00:02:42.609> of<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.790> on<00:02:42.939> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
sure how I liked the look of it on the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.350 
sure how I liked the look of it on the
buy

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
buy

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.300 
buy
and<00:02:43.630> after<00:02:43.900> taking<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.680> off<00:02:44.770> putting<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.220> back

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
and after taking it off putting it back

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.400 
and after taking it off putting it back
on<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.760> looking<00:02:46.420> at<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.630> bike<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:46.990> about<00:02:47.380> a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
on and looking at this bike for about a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.380 
on and looking at this bike for about a
month<00:02:47.650> now<00:02:47.860> using<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.370> windscreen<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.820> really

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
month now using this windscreen I really

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.970 
month now using this windscreen I really
like<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> look<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.050> think<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.350> adds<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.770> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
like the look I think it adds to the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.400 
like the look I think it adds to the
bike<00:02:51.190> instead<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.090> takes<00:02:52.330> away<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.050> prefer

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
bike instead of takes away so I prefer

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.560 
bike instead of takes away so I prefer
the<00:02:53.500> look<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.830> bike<00:02:53.950> with<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.970> smaller

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the look of the bike with this smaller

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.830 
the look of the bike with this smaller
version<00:02:56.140> that's<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:57.040> darkest<00:02:57.490> color<00:02:57.840> now

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
version that's the darkest color now

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.970 
version that's the darkest color now

let's talk about installation

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.400 
let's talk about installation
installation<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.940> super<00:03:01.270> easy<00:03:01.300> Yamaha<00:03:02.230> has

basically so what I'm gonna do at first
I<00:03:32.590> thought<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.770> was<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.040> get<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.610> bolts

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
I thought I was going to get like bolts

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.490 
I thought I was going to get like bolts
that<00:03:34.090> are<00:03:34.150> about<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.390> quarter<00:03:34.630> inch<00:03:34.780> longer<00:03:35.170> it

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
that are about a quarter inch longer it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250 
that are about a quarter inch longer it
just<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.100> ever<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.610> slightly<00:03:37.030> short<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.230> I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
just it's ever so slightly short so I

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.170 
just it's ever so slightly short so I
wanna<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.130> now<00:03:39.310> looking<00:03:39.700> at<00:03:39.820> it<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.060> could

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
wanna but now looking at it you could

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.580 
wanna but now looking at it you could
tell<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:40.930> needs<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.110> be<00:03:41.260> bent<00:03:41.440> up

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
tell that it just needs to be bent up

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.920 
tell that it just needs to be bent up
slightly<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.370> did<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> little<00:03:43.450> bit<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.660> research

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
slightly I did a little bit of research

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.260 
slightly I did a little bit of research
online<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.680> most<00:03:45.640> people<00:03:45.850> didn't<00:03:46.060> have<00:03:46.120> this

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
online and most people didn't have this

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.370 
online and most people didn't have this
issue<00:03:46.420> they're<00:03:46.660> about<00:03:46.810> two<00:03:47.020> people<00:03:47.200> that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
issue they're about two people that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680 
issue they're about two people that
didn't<00:03:47.799> mention<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.160> didn't<00:03:48.640> fit<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.060> it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
didn't mention that didn't fit so it's

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.970 
didn't mention that didn't fit so it's
just<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.930> quality<00:03:50.230> control<00:03:50.440> thing

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
just a quality control thing

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.850 
just a quality control thing
unfortunately<00:03:52.110> there<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.260> an<00:03:53.410> issue<00:03:53.530> with

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
unfortunately there is an issue with

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.220 
unfortunately there is an issue with
that<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.040> wish<00:03:54.489> they<00:03:54.700> would<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.360> know<00:03:55.390> do

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
that I wish they would you know do

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.320 
that I wish they would you know do
better<00:03:56.260> quality<00:03:57.040> wise<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.489> don't<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.239> very

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
better quality wise I don't have very

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.420 
better quality wise I don't have very
much<00:03:58.510> experience<00:03:58.570> with<00:03:59.110> P<00:03:59.350> League<00:03:59.560> but<00:04:00.340> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
much experience with P League but it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.190 
much experience with P League but it
shouldn't<00:04:00.700> be<00:04:00.730> an<00:04:01.030> issue<00:04:01.150> just<00:04:01.570> grab<00:04:01.930> some

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
shouldn't be an issue just grab some

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100 
shouldn't be an issue just grab some
pliers<00:04:02.560> bend<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.730> up<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.150> should<00:04:04.360> fit<00:04:04.660> fine

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
pliers bend it up and it should fit fine

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.410 
pliers bend it up and it should fit fine
and<00:04:05.470> now<00:04:06.400> let's<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:06.670> talk<00:04:06.910> about<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
and now let's just talk about the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.199 
and now let's just talk about the
performance<00:04:08.200> how<00:04:08.470> how<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.310> does<00:04:09.519> what<00:04:10.060> it's

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
performance how how it does what it's

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.690 
performance how how it does what it's
supposed<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.690> do<00:04:10.959> now<00:04:11.709> at<00:04:11.950> first<00:04:12.190> when<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.489> put

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
supposed to do now at first when I put

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.009 
supposed to do now at first when I put
it<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:13.150> didn't<00:04:13.330> ride<00:04:13.450> my<00:04:13.540> bike<00:04:13.720> for<00:04:13.900> about

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
it on I didn't ride my bike for about

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.170 
it on I didn't ride my bike for about
two<00:04:14.410> days<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.040> then<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.549> put<00:04:15.820> this<00:04:15.940> on

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
two days and then I put this on

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.849 
two days and then I put this on
installed<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.989> went<00:04:17.169> for<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.350> ride<00:04:17.620> and

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
installed and I went for a ride and

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.949 
installed and I went for a ride and
honestly<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.790> could<00:04:19.030> feel<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> little<00:04:19.479> bit<00:04:19.840> of

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
honestly I could feel a little bit of

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.509 
honestly I could feel a little bit of
difference<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.799> didn't<00:04:21.100> feel<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.370> was

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
difference but I didn't feel like it was

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.480 
difference but I didn't feel like it was
that<00:04:21.609> much<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.300> difference<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.770> at<00:04:24.100> first<00:04:24.370> I

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
that much of a difference so at first I

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.460 
that much of a difference so at first I
was<00:04:24.610> thinking<00:04:24.850> maybe<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.419> should<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.440> know

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
was thinking maybe I should you know

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.070 
was thinking maybe I should you know
send<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:26.979> back<00:04:27.160> exchange<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.270> get<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
send it back exchange it and get the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.390 
send it back exchange it and get the
touring<00:04:29.410> version<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.950> leave<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.280> off

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
touring version and leave it off

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.730 
touring version and leave it off
completely<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:31.870> if<00:04:32.050> I'm<00:04:32.169> going<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.620> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
completely and then if I'm going on the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.010 
completely and then if I'm going on the
long<00:04:32.950> ride<00:04:33.190> say<00:04:33.669> now<00:04:33.910> or<00:04:34.090> more<00:04:34.390> then<00:04:34.690> I'll<00:04:34.810> put

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
some kind of testing I basically went on

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.280 
some kind of testing I basically went on
a<00:04:41.320> long<00:04:41.590> ride<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.160> took<00:04:42.640> it<00:04:43.090> off<00:04:43.240> went<00:04:43.930> on<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.050> ride

a long ride I took it off went on a ride
again<00:04:44.440> on<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.070> highway<00:04:45.430> doing<00:04:45.880> it's<00:04:46.030> about<00:04:46.210> 70

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
again on the highway doing it's about 70

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.170 
again on the highway doing it's about 70
75<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.410> that's<00:04:48.010> when<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.250> really<00:04:48.669> noticed<00:04:49.000> that

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
75 and that's when I really noticed that

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.990 
75 and that's when I really noticed that
mount<00:04:49.419> of

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
mount of

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.720 
mount of
it<00:04:50.210> makes<00:04:50.540> writing<00:04:51.470> with<00:04:51.950> this<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.550> short

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
it makes writing with this the short

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.130 
it makes writing with this the short
version

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
version

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.380 
version
I<00:04:54.170> still<00:04:54.890> feel<00:04:55.130> wind<00:04:55.460> blast<00:04:55.760> but<00:04:56.240> it's

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
I still feel wind blast but it's

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.390 
I still feel wind blast but it's
definitely<00:04:56.720> reduced<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.650> don't<00:04:57.710> feel<00:04:58.070> even

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400

that's 75 that I'm being pulled off the
bike<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.310> still<00:05:01.670> feel<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:01.940> I'm<00:05:02.060> riding<00:05:02.240> a

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
bike so I still feel like I'm riding a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.570 
bike so I still feel like I'm riding a
naked<00:05:02.660> bike<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.620> still<00:05:03.890> lets<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.160> little<00:05:04.280> bit<00:05:04.460> in

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
naked bike it still lets a little bit in

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.150 
naked bike it still lets a little bit in
this<00:05:04.850> kind<00:05:05.600> of<00:05:05.660> wind<00:05:06.260> in<00:05:06.440> from<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.710> sides<00:05:06.950> and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
this kind of wind in from the sides and

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.010 
this kind of wind in from the sides and
you<00:05:07.280> still<00:05:07.550> feel<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.790> right<00:05:08.120> about<00:05:08.360> here<00:05:08.420> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
you still feel it right about here the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.050 
you still feel it right about here the
top<00:05:09.200> of<00:05:09.350> your<00:05:09.440> shoulders<00:05:09.830> but<00:05:10.430> there's<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.700> lot

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
top of your shoulders but there's a lot

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.330 
top of your shoulders but there's a lot
less<00:05:11.450> right<00:05:11.780> here<00:05:12.230> as<00:05:12.650> soon<00:05:12.800> as<00:05:12.920> you<00:05:13.010> take<00:05:13.160> it

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
less right here as soon as you take it

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.620 
less right here as soon as you take it
off<00:05:13.460> you're<00:05:13.760> just<00:05:13.970> feel<00:05:14.150> like<00:05:14.360> you're<00:05:14.510> getting

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
off you're just feel like you're getting

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.330 
off you're just feel like you're getting
pushed<00:05:15.080> off<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.440> bike<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.620> have<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.950> hold<00:05:16.160> on

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
pushed off the bike you have to hold on

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.910 
pushed off the bike you have to hold on
so<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.300> definitely<00:05:17.540> makes<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.200> difference<00:05:18.230> if

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920
