00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.619
 still has something to say what I have 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.180
 empty right now I still have something to say 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 and you can as well 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.070
 be accepted because he is at the moment 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.720
 no supporters look for but if the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.369
 really a very good application 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.439
 We also feel that way 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.210
 not in this way then you will potter 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 you may have accepted but the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.570
 Gifts not very high so that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 it was deep the form or the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.860
 so to speak pattern solution so the template 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490
 for the application is again in the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
