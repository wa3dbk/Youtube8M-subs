00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.230
 Yes Hello Thank you for your viewing 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.519
 ntt docomo's line 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.299
 Companies providing Internet services at low prices 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.560
 b mobile 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.030
 Or Nippon Communications 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 Starting today 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:30.500
 I would like to talk about these 2 items and 2 types in various ways. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 Anyway, there are a lot of things to talk about 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:41.620
 So much in a row 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:43.250
 If you talk about this, you may get bored on the way, so I want to post a video of a different story in between 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.040
 I think that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.290
 Today I would like to talk only about the good and bad things about b mobile 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.560
 think 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.470
 The nice thing about this b mobile is 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.510
 Unlike the three major carriers 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.510
 There is no such thing as 2 years 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.650
 It can be stopped in time to stop or 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.650
 And there is no penalty fee 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.360
 Speaking exactly 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.700
 For example 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.840
 today 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.159
 If it is possible to end this month full if the cancellation procedure by say want to quit 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.290
 It sounds like 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.300
 First, I This is the first one 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.300
 Then it's two eyes 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.110
 Fit your application 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.110
 There is a charge plan 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.310
 And say what it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 For example 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.970
 I usually 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 Because I do not use it for Internet heavy so much or just do a little research 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.870
 Also to good apart from slow speed 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640
 I want to make it cheaper 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.640
 Such person is this 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:10.460
 Monthly fixed amount 980 yen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:13.550
 There is a service called all-you-can-eat at a speed of 150 km bps 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.250
 This is 150 kbps 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.450
 It's a fairly slow communication, so I really want to do some research 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.879
 after 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:30.910
 I Toka is its about the hand of want to see the little seen or Toka weather forecast the transfer guide the train 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:36.720
 It is for people who use it like that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 I do not use the Internet so much this month so cheap price is good 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:46.550
 But next month I want to download videos and watch youtube 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.310
 I want to use lt next month 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.080
 Furthermore, because the moon often doesn't use the internet that much 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.930
 I want to choose a cheaper rate plan 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.230
 If you say 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.670
 Delicious 6 on this day 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.660
 The Lord 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.920
 300 kbps speed of service of Oh 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.020
 lte Communication service 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.700
 In 120 days 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:26.610
 Communication plan using 1 gb for communication days 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:32.370
 This is a plan where you can freely choose 3 types of plans here 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.840
 I do not use the Internet so much, but I want the lte communication 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 If anyone who 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.910
 Click here for the fair gb 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.040
 There is something called 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.730
 This is already from the beginning 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.540
 It supports both lt ear and foma plus area 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.490
 Use a communication capacity of up to 2 gb 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.830
 Can do 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.360
 If you are familiar with speed limit and communication capacity 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.020
 Think Well You know I heard the story so far 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.210
 It might have during it 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:15.280
 If you have no knowledge at all just listen to this story 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.280
 Maybe some people may not understand at first though 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.040
 Well later it is also 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.690
 Talk about a fine place 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.110
 Next is 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.110
 I would like to talk about the disappointing part of b mobile 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.650
 No matter how good 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.650
 After all there is a weakness 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.170
 First of all, one bad thing about b mobile 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:51.139
 It is officially out of the b mobile 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:56.139
 There are very few products 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:58.230
 Products officially released by b mobile 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:03.340
 wi-fi router 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:07.480
 And after this is only a smartphone called ideos 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:12.380
 That is d card coming out from the sim card 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:16.529
 If this event is pushed, only this luteer can be used 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.960
 There is no such thing, though 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:27.060
 ntt docomo line 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.060
 As we use, we can use if it is smartphone of ntt docomo 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:38.240
 Well I will talk about the terminal in another video and then the next disappointing thing is 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.360
 By terminal 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:49.219
 It is that little problem occurs 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.219
 For example, here we are using the sim card of this communication today 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.239
 If it is 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.710
 Here 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:04.500
 If this triangle has a curtain radio wave 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:11.400
 You should see 3g here 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:14.889
 However, this does not appear as 3g even though the radio wave has arrived properly 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.230
 This is out of range 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:23.190
 This is why this sim card is 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:26.650
 I know only seasonal curve of the Internet 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.560
 There are no radio waves in the call 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.240
 So this 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.000
 Terminal 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.790
 I'm trying to find the radio wave of the call 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.480
 But 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:45.810
 This does not enter the radio wave of the call , so it gets out of range 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.470
 So Is there any way to fix this this 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.870
 a 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.080
 I contacted Japan Communications, but 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.900
 this is 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.940
 I can not fix it because it is a specification 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:05.990
 I'm the answer is returned that 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:07.390
 However, there is actually a way to cure this 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:11.050
 But 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:17.310
 It is very difficult 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.310
 As I do not understand at all, as a last resort 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.030
 this 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:29.620
 I'm out of play store 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:32.320
 This 3g antenna display Problem solved using this app 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.230
 It is out of range here 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.330
 This 3g antenna display 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.840
 Download and use it like this 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:47.650
 It will be displayed as 3g 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.650
 So you can improve if you use the app 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.930
 But Japan correspondence is 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.050
 Up to that 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:59.360
 Did not do the sun 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:01.750
 I wonder where it 's such a hope to firm a little more support 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.240
 It is one more regrettable place 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:08.830
 Yes, for now 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.390
 It is roughly, but of Japan communication 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:17.300
 I talked about good and bad things 

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:17.300
 Thank you for watching today to here
