project thank you so much for your help
so<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.759> video<00:00:11.940> I'm<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.360> talking

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
so in this video I'm going to be talking

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.099 
so in this video I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.920> get<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.519> arm<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.240> motion

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
about how we can get the arm in motion

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590 
about how we can get the arm in motion
to<00:00:16.830> be<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> initiates<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> shift

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
to be the one that initiates the shift

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
to be the one that initiates the shift
ok<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> you'll<00:00:19.859> recall<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
ok and you'll recall from the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.730 
ok and you'll recall from the
introduction<00:00:21.090> introduction<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.289> shifting

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
introduction introduction to shifting

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
introduction introduction to shifting
video<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> talked<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.359> how<00:00:24.480> it's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
video then I talked about how it's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
video then I talked about how it's
necessary<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.279> anticipate<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.580> shift<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
necessary to anticipate the shift and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.890 
necessary to anticipate the shift and
that<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.500> largely<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:30.000> arm<00:00:30.269> motion

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that that's largely what this arm motion

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.080 
that that's largely what this arm motion
does<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:32.940> doing

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
does so what we're going to be doing

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
does so what we're going to be doing
here<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.510> quite<00:00:33.750> exaggerated<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
here is quite exaggerated for what you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.810 
here is quite exaggerated for what you
might<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.260> real<00:00:38.219> context

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
might actually do in a real context

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
might actually do in a real context
but<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.960> didn't<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> smaller<00:00:41.100> scale

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
but we didn't do this on a smaller scale

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
but we didn't do this on a smaller scale
in<00:00:41.820> rolling<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.570> makes<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.559> I'm

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
in rolling it makes it what it is is I'm

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.560 
in rolling it makes it what it is is I'm
going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.489> wind<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.390> my<00:00:45.690> arm<00:00:46.129> to<00:00:47.129> throw<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:48.239> hand

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to wind up my arm to throw my hand

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.439 
going to wind up my arm to throw my hand
um<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> new<00:00:50.309> part<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> cello<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.210> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
um to a new part of the cello so just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
um to a new part of the cello so just
like<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.750> baseball<00:00:52.020> player<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.860> they

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
like a baseball player you know they

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
like a baseball player you know they
wouldn't<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.430> throw<00:00:53.489> by<00:00:53.960> going<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
wouldn't just throw by going like that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.340 
wouldn't just throw by going like that
though<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.010> wind<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:58.109> come

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
though they would wind up and then come

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.220 
though they would wind up and then come
for<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.940> throw

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
for it right that's how you would throw

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
for it right that's how you would throw
same<00:01:01.230> thing<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.160> shift<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.730> least<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
same thing with our shift at least you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
same thing with our shift at least you
can<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.339> shift<00:01:05.580> motion

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can do this to get your shift motion

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.130 
can do this to get your shift motion
going<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> bring<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
going so I'm going to bring it back and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
going so I'm going to bring it back and
throw<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.380> hand<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.520> try<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
throw my hand up okay try that just a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.330 
throw my hand up okay try that just a
bunch<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> time<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.350> bring<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
bunch of time so I'm bring it around and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.820 
bunch of time so I'm bring it around and
throw<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.180> hand<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.080> circular

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
throw my hand up it's kind of a circular

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.359 
throw my hand up it's kind of a circular
motion<00:01:17.810> bringing<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
motion bringing it down then up and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.390 
motion bringing it down then up and
around<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.780> probably<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:22.979> hand<00:01:23.220> should

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
around and now probably your hand should

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.580 
around and now probably your hand should
end<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.759> somewhere<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.720> okay<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
end up somewhere way up there okay so it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
end up somewhere way up there okay so it
literally<00:01:25.920> feels<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:27.270> throwing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
literally feels like you're throwing

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.710 
literally feels like you're throwing
your<00:01:27.900> hand<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.040> too<00:01:29.250> many<00:01:29.400> times

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
your hand and do this too many times

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.850 
your hand and do this too many times
this<00:01:30.720> might<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.110> uncomfortable<00:01:31.680> from

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this might get uncomfortable from

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
this might get uncomfortable from
slamming<00:01:32.130> against<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> side<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
slamming against the side here but you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
slamming against the side here but you
can<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
can also do it the other way now this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
can also do it the other way now this
one<00:01:34.799> takes<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.610> imagination<00:01:36.210> but

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
one takes a little more imagination but

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.319 
one takes a little more imagination but
I'm<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> wind<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.860> forward<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:39.119> bring

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I'm going to wind up go forward to bring

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'm going to wind up go forward to bring
my<00:01:39.450> arm<00:01:39.659> back<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.829> go<00:01:41.579> forward<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.479> bring<00:01:42.659> my

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
my arm back right go forward to bring my

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
my arm back right go forward to bring my
arm<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.979> back<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> bring<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:44.790> own

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
arm back then go back to bring my own

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
arm back then go back to bring my own
forward<00:01:45.360> forward<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.200> bring<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.500> arm<00:01:46.649> back

forward forward to bring my arm back
back<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.880> bring<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.210> arm<00:01:48.420> forward<00:01:48.869> okay<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
back to bring my arm forward okay and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
back to bring my arm forward okay and
feeling<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> hand<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.500> neutral

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
feeling like the hand is very neutral

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
feeling like the hand is very neutral
through<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:54.630> nothing<00:01:55.049> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
through all of this it does nothing it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
through all of this it does nothing it's
just<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> blob<00:01:56.360> connected<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> end<00:01:57.719> okay<00:01:58.700> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
just a blob connected at the end okay so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.389 
just a blob connected at the end okay so
this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> way<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.409> freedom<00:02:02.250> in

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this is a way to get that freedom in

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
this is a way to get that freedom in
here<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.540> suggest<00:02:03.570> trying

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
here and then I would suggest trying

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.660 
here and then I would suggest trying
this<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.560> bow<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> sound

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
this with your bow not going to sound

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.290 
this with your bow not going to sound
pretty

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.450 
pretty
we<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.570> something<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:08.870> right<00:02:09.950> perfect<00:02:10.950> then

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
we got something like right perfect then

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.180 
we got something like right perfect then
from<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.820> other<00:02:11.940> direction

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.280
