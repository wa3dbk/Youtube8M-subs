there's<00:00:15.670> an<00:00:15.940> alphabet<00:00:16.390> to<00:00:16.510> art<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.930> that's

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
there's an alphabet to art and that's

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.370 
there's an alphabet to art and that's
what<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.440> want<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.770> get<00:00:17.830> into<00:00:18.010> now<00:00:18.369> and<00:00:19.270> be<00:00:20.200> able

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
what I want to get into now and be able

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.260 
what I want to get into now and be able
to<00:00:20.529> really<00:00:20.800> communicate<00:00:21.100> in<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.790> language<00:00:22.150> of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
to really communicate in the language of

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.940 
to really communicate in the language of
art<00:00:22.480> not<00:00:22.960> only<00:00:23.230> from<00:00:23.440> your<00:00:23.619> creative

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
art not only from your creative

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.480 
art not only from your creative
information<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.090> ideas<00:00:25.690> but<00:00:26.320> also

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
information and ideas but also

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.620 
information and ideas but also
understanding<00:00:27.490> what<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.790> Masters<00:00:28.240> have<00:00:28.419> done

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
understanding what the Masters have done

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.420 
understanding what the Masters have done
and<00:00:28.869> their<00:00:29.050> whole<00:00:29.200> decision-making<00:00:29.860> process

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
and their whole decision-making process

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.470 
and their whole decision-making process
there<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:31.150> what's<00:00:31.540> called<00:00:32.050> an<00:00:32.410> s-curve<00:00:33.480> okay

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
there is what's called an s-curve okay

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.080 
there is what's called an s-curve okay
now<00:00:34.900> if<00:00:34.990> I<00:00:35.050> turn<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.500> painting<00:00:36.010> upside<00:00:36.790> down

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
now if I turn this painting upside down

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.330 
now if I turn this painting upside down
so<00:00:37.840> we've<00:00:37.990> gone<00:00:38.110> over<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.410> couple<00:00:38.710> elements

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
so we've gone over a couple elements

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.640 
so we've gone over a couple elements
we've<00:00:39.760> gone<00:00:39.910> over<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.210> diagonals<00:00:40.750> we've<00:00:41.470> gone

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
we've gone over the diagonals we've gone

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.130 
we've gone over the diagonals we've gone
over<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.610> square<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:43.690> center<00:00:44.020> of

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
over the the square the center of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.490 
over the the square the center of
interest<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:46.510> if<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:46.780> take<00:00:46.990> a<00:00:47.050> look<00:00:47.350> at

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
interest and now if you take a look at

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.520 
interest and now if you take a look at
the<00:00:47.680> s-curve<00:00:48.400> that's<00:00:49.390> also<00:00:49.870> one<00:00:50.200> of<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.380> major

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
the s-curve that's also one of the major

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.020 
the s-curve that's also one of the major
elements<00:00:51.130> in<00:00:51.250> design<00:00:51.580> which<00:00:51.820> we'll<00:00:52.000> be

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
elements in design which we'll be

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.120 
elements in design which we'll be
talking<00:00:52.330> about<00:00:52.660> do<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.410> happen<00:00:53.590> to<00:00:53.740> see<00:00:54.010> an

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
talking about do you happen to see an

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.350 
talking about do you happen to see an
s-curve<00:00:54.580> in<00:00:54.820> this<00:00:54.940> painting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
s-curve in this painting

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.770 
s-curve in this painting
well<00:00:55.960> obviously<00:00:56.740> look<00:00:57.370> at<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:58.210> know<00:00:58.330> and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
well obviously look at that you know and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.320 
well obviously look at that you know and
now<00:00:59.020> not<00:00:59.380> only<00:00:59.410> is<00:01:00.010> are<00:01:00.430> these<00:01:00.910> figures

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
now not only is are these figures

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.420 
now not only is are these figures
organized<00:01:01.930> in<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:02.380> fashion<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.940> also<00:01:08.430> they

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
organized in this fashion but also they

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.350 
organized in this fashion but also they
are

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
are

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.770 
are
it's<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.290> s-curve<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.570> major

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
it's the s-curve that is the major

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.190 
it's the s-curve that is the major
arabesque<00:01:14.499> that<00:01:14.829> leads<00:01:15.249> the<00:01:15.939> eye<00:01:15.969> around<00:01:16.719> the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
arabesque that leads the eye around the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.080 
arabesque that leads the eye around the
painting<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:18.159> when<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.520> come<00:01:18.789> in<00:01:18.939> this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
painting so when you come in this

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.959 
painting so when you come in this
painting<00:01:19.359> you<00:01:20.200> follow<00:01:20.859> through<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.700> flow

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
painting you follow through and flow

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.230 
painting you follow through and flow
through<00:01:22.329> the<00:01:22.479> s-curve<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.490> come<00:01:25.210> back

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
through the s-curve and then come back

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.529 
through the s-curve and then come back
out<00:01:25.749> and<00:01:26.170> your<00:01:26.380> eye<00:01:26.409> continues<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.399> go<00:01:27.579> around

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
out and your eye continues to go around

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.050 
out and your eye continues to go around
it<00:01:28.869> comes<00:01:29.109> around<00:01:29.439> here<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.460> down<00:01:30.880> these

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
it comes around here and down these

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.959 
it comes around here and down these
branches<00:01:31.719> out<00:01:31.899> of<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.289> picture<00:01:32.679> plane<00:01:32.969> into

over now if you look at the boo guru

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.949 
over now if you look at the boo guru
here<00:02:18.780> he's<00:02:19.780> done<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.370> he<00:02:21.370> takes<00:02:21.959> vertical

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
here he's done that he takes vertical

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.000 
here he's done that he takes vertical
angles<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.650> repeat

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
angles and repeat

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.920 
angles and repeat
some<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.450> trees<00:02:25.810> coming<00:02:26.500> through<00:02:26.830> here<00:02:27.930> he

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
some as the trees coming through here he

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.309 
some as the trees coming through here he
has<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.769> horizon<00:02:30.459> horizontal<00:02:31.330> angles<00:02:31.870> coming

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
has the horizon horizontal angles coming

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.080 
has the horizon horizontal angles coming
through<00:02:32.560> here<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.870> he<00:02:34.959> also<00:02:35.140> has<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:37.030> kind

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
you actually tie the painting together

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.550 
you actually tie the painting together
and<00:02:52.290> provide<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:54.730> rhythm<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.599> well<00:02:56.410> as<00:02:56.530> a

what I'm sharing with you is an
intellectual<00:03:04.660> connection<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.500> instead<00:03:05.859> of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
intellectual connection so instead of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.270 
intellectual connection so instead of
being<00:03:06.250> reactive<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.900> artwork<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.590> trying

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
being reactive to the artwork and trying

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.220 
being reactive to the artwork and trying
to<00:03:09.400> make<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.700> work<00:03:09.879> you<00:03:10.629> can<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:10.959> be

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
to make it work you can actually be

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.099 
to make it work you can actually be
proactive<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.450> more<00:03:13.660> control<00:03:14.079> over

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
your paintings as you design them take a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.319 
your paintings as you design them take a
look<00:03:16.720> at<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> Raphael<00:03:17.650> drawing<00:03:18.069> there's<00:03:18.910> an

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
look at a Raphael drawing there's an

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.500 
look at a Raphael drawing there's an
angle<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.470> like<00:03:21.190> with<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.579> arm<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.359> can

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
angle here like with the arm you can

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.160 
angle here like with the arm you can
feel<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.489> that's<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.819> same<00:03:25.090> angle<00:03:25.660> as<00:03:25.780> the

together well design-wise color wise but

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.659 
together well design-wise color wise but
it<00:03:52.359> just<00:03:52.660> needs<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.319> oomph<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:54.099> packed

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
it just needs that oomph that packed
