00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
I would not have thought of it but that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.390 
I would not have thought of it but that
was<00:04:25.780> actually<00:04:25.990> good<00:04:26.200> though<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.350> mean<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.800> kept

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
was actually good though I mean it kept

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.990 
was actually good though I mean it kept
him<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:28.030> place<00:04:28.770> special<00:04:29.770> things<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.700> kept

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
him in one place special things it kept

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.180 
him in one place special things it kept
him<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.300> one<00:04:31.539> place<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.320> just<00:04:32.440> sprayed<00:04:33.039> with

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
him in one place I just sprayed with

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.219 
him in one place I just sprayed with
electric<00:04:33.550> gel<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.120> wish<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.900> would<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.110> given

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
electric gel I wish it would have given

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.810 
electric gel I wish it would have given
us<00:04:35.440> more<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.740> an<00:04:35.800> option<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.130> carry<00:04:36.400> more<00:04:36.610> ammo

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
us more of an option to carry more ammo

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.270 
us more of an option to carry more ammo
though<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> could<00:04:37.300> probably<00:04:37.479> just<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:38.280> got

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
though I could probably just like I got

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.040 
though I could probably just like I got
a<00:04:39.310> hose<00:04:39.520> them<00:04:39.729> down<00:04:39.760> for<00:04:40.210> like<00:04:40.390> throughout<00:04:40.900> the

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
a hose them down for like throughout the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.150 
a hose them down for like throughout the
whole<00:04:41.169> entire<00:04:41.200> fight<00:04:41.590> without<00:04:41.740> reloading

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
whole entire fight without reloading

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.279 
whole entire fight without reloading
that<00:04:42.490> had<00:04:42.580> been<00:04:42.700> cool<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> boss

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
that had been cool but then the boss

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.440 
that had been cool but then the boss
battle<00:04:44.680> would<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:45.160> from<00:04:45.700> super<00:04:46.090> hard<00:04:46.300> to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
battle would be like from super hard to

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.770 
battle would be like from super hard to
like<00:04:46.630> super<00:04:47.470> easy<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:49.060> electric<00:04:49.330> gel<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.630> do

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
like super easy that electric gel I do

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.750 
like super easy that electric gel I do
