00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 welcome a new video here we are 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.190
 back 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.599
 I like it a lot 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 this is what I experienced a while ago 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.230
 but it was super badly shot and mall 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 perfectly with the new computer the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 case is that are four mini islands and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the middle there is lava as you are seeing and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.810
 now we can do well jump and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.340
 hit him for example is man and we are 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.480
 as four teams and they enter all and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 there is a fight a fight between four 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.490
 team basically there's no more so to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 see which one makes voice is worth at the moment 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.030
 we have people around here to see if we do not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 assail that be careful that they assault us 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 my teammates got it up Uncle 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.129
 seriously seriously you see camper and you're going 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 to leave here abandoned 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:50.629
 I intimidated with the dates to see if 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.220
 I get to kill the sad one that I know 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.960
 here goes comrades who are going to die 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.350
 perfect to the first one that passes of cortitas 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.640
 but cool 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 I have this same thing up here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 and I really loved how pathetic 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.060
 he is worth then what we are going to do is see 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 this date nobody has told you just down 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.399
 worldwide campeando above 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 building and then there 's this is that 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.940
 Of course the map goes like burning sights 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.700
 has seen the map goes like eating 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 it's like weird 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 How do we do it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.909
 the green team remains one in a gentleman in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.420
 green team that I honestly do not have 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420
 no idea where it is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.060
 listening doing something around here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.970
 if he is encouraging block friend 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.159
 so what we're going to do is going to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.290
 be up 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.940
 fuck if it would not be worth golden apple 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.060
 I think it starts the account that I'm 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.060
 here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.530
 what a bad fellow we were passing bayern 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 way he was doing here his 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.460
 almost everything your friend knows the feet 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.460
 do not 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.630
 he killed him for grief he kills for grief I've 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.490
 killed by grief already manages a heart in 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.800
 my team are three in yellow 4 and 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.660
 in the red 2 is worth I think I do not have 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.850
 nobody, we are not even one but how 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.130
 I arrived I have no idea 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
 web or are you going to see I think I'm about to go 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.190
 for the red because back there without being 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 account for the island is burning 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.730
 the eye is worth it is that I have very few 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.390
 I'm an apple, I have one damn left 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 Apple, we're going to catch this, "he said. 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.340
 Okay, because if it's average it went down like 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.959
 yes we could finish 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.959
 an apple like that 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.560
 a new game we are here in another 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 map in which it has up one 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.620
 tree for people to change is 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.629
 prohibited what we 're going to this recipe that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.920
 around here we are 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.920
 and eye because it opens 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.310
 good good good 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.170
 green team I think I catch that is 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.890
 the people here very subiditas let's see 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.450
 a monet yellow for several both is worth 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.190
 the key is to go all to ask 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.049
 very well and very well good jump is a 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.879
 good jump is the truth worth worth 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.120
 it would even help mate but of course it is 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.120
 that I have 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.170
 good 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.340
 it would be perfect it is fine team well 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.950
 we are two you and me me and your partner 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.159
 me and you you and me who gave me for friend 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.810
 how are we going to do it and we are two 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.670
 X or three teams are left each 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 with two players the blues are 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.650
 marking the camping father 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.090
 and the other team three quarters of what 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.099
 same 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.450
 so if it's also up there, it's worth 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.080
 mate you and I and you how 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.519
 we make 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.780
 I think we're going up there and I think 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.870
 that's going to be the great technique 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.850
 I do not know if making monkey chips I hope 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.850
 Not because I'm being watched 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 fields and watching per second to upload 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 to climb 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.640
 what happens friend saw man is everything very 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.990
 you know who you stop going to or 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.800

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.960

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.710
