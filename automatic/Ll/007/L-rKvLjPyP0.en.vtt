real<00:00:01.589> menace<00:00:02.179> I've<00:00:03.179> got<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.480> question<00:00:03.720> a

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
real menace I've got this question a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.940 
real menace I've got this question a
while<00:00:04.140> back<00:00:05.029> asking<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.240> chicken<00:00:06.950> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
while back asking how you chicken and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.320 
while back asking how you chicken and
obviously<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:08.400> guys<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.849> don't<00:00:08.940> know<00:00:09.090> it's

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
obviously for guys that don't know it's

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.660 
obviously for guys that don't know it's
basically<00:00:09.510> when<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.170> chicken<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:11.219> counter<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
basically when you chicken you counter a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.150 
basically when you chicken you counter a
reversal<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.809> score<00:00:13.230> June<00:00:13.440> devil<00:00:14.040> gene

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
reversal so that a score June devil gene

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.330 
reversal so that a score June devil gene
they<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> reversal<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:16.130> usually<00:00:17.130> if<00:00:17.220> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
they have a reversal and usually if you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
they have a reversal and usually if you
do<00:00:17.490> something<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.590> damage

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
do something like that use and damage

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
do something like that use and damage
place<00:00:20.250> nicely<00:00:20.520> guaranteed<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.420> chicken

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
place nicely guaranteed you can chicken

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
place nicely guaranteed you can chicken
it<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.650> something<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it but it's something that you have to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.240 
it but it's something that you have to
anticipate<00:00:24.500> carbon<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.890> something<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
anticipate carbon it's not something you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.830 
anticipate carbon it's not something you
can<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> reaction<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> chicken

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
can do a reaction because the chicken

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.009 
can do a reaction because the chicken
window<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:29.070> window<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
window the window that you have to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.049 
window the window that you have to
chicken<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.590> large<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.820> it's

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
chicken is not large at all so it's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.400 
chicken is not large at all so it's
definitely<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.690> something<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> don't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
definitely not something you can don't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.209 
definitely not something you can don't
reaction<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.760> basically<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
reaction so basically the way to do is

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.090 
reaction so basically the way to do is
if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:39.320> if<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.250> three<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
if you do if you do a one or three and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
if you do if you do a one or three and
they<00:00:44.100> reversal<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> move<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:46.260> doesn't

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
they reversal that move it doesn't

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
they reversal that move it doesn't
matter<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.039> even<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.579> even<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
matter if it's even if if even if it's a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.690 
matter if it's even if if even if it's a
standing<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.410> Crouch<00:00:49.829> that's<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.370> or

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
standing one or Crouch that's one or

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
standing one or Crouch that's one or
back<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.230> June<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.739> down

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
back or one or back on June but down

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400

forward one whatever is it's just a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.680 
forward one whatever is it's just a
button<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> matters<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> do

you hold forward and the e + 2 + 4 you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.530 
you hold forward and the e + 2 + 4 you
kind<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.030> mash<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
kind of you kind of have to mash it you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
kind of you kind of have to mash it you
know<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.170> can't<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> reaction<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
know because you can't do a reaction and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
know because you can't do a reaction and
timing<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.700> very<00:01:35.970> difficult<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.479> mash

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
timing is very difficult you just mash

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.969 
timing is very difficult you just mash
it<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.470> hope<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.750> show<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> yeah

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have to practice and it's not that
