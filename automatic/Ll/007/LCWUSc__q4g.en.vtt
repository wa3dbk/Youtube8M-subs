00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.400
 We are always trying to change our look. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.599
 with her hair and brush 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.230
 a true 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.589
 It's the best of all is that we can 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.549
 this afternoon in the lounge of the select hairdressing salon marcos proenÃ§a I go 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:32.780
 show a classic 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.080
 the hair shaft is still 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.470
 What would you do if you can put it in and take it? 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.160
 and short hair and understand that you can not say the wrong way 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 shebab coinage and hairdresser the iptu also had then that it is possible to have 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.460
 Long hair while on the same day is because there is this thing that the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.080
 petista was from the crisis of the chapter that will marry children and that his hair 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.770
 now you do not need it anymore 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 We already have long hair in the same text now we use these 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.480
 facts that are these three lines 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.440
 and she always has 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.560
 and this hair is a natural hair really is the big secret is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 hair with a good texture why 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.060
 there is nothing more horrible than a woman in the hair is false or if it is to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.450
 put to have been stupidly amazing perfect and how much for mouse 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.240
 what you think 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.300
 this extension 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.110
 even before competing I will be able to realize my dream of each hair 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.790
 long and whenever to wait 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 now that I know if it gets much more current 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.760
 the stage is to paint the hair in the personal quota that we make people get one 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.120
 hair that has to do with natural color ' 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.860
 It's similar to what we do. 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 have to stay the same color as the person's hair 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.070
 Then use it for people like cola, third of the year. 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.160
 very curious 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 now 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.340
 people last year 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.290
 And then we can parade 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 the hair 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.390
 so we say it's where the police are going to be and since October 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.379
 we twist 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.420
 Can be 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.849
 the apo to put the police 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.379
 ae 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.479
 let us loose more 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.289
 but analyzing if she can do at home herself also then this part 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.409
 says he adopted it if it were not for so many layers 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.199
 It's good to have these two to three I think that whatever it takes to 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.900
 It is very natural because it feels very much like a man. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.810
 and little is going to change the way the confrontation 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.330
 I'm going to put now the other option that always sead that it's as if a person 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.039
 run alone because 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.849
 the selection if really able to express itself 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.430
 so the team captain we made a division I like things in a way 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.259
 He gave 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.800
 after dragging more harmoniously afterwards 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.459
 the conversations on paper 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.429
 instead of finishing 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.689
 and then we put it in 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.059
 a government spokesman 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.749
 17 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:07.139
 In August 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.629
 the festival 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.479
 is here 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.479
 We lost the new one. 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 the older the crowd once again more space 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.809
 Then we'll loose our hair. 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 and we have to mix these problems 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:27.699
 With the support 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.729
 5 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.099
 Dunga 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.099
 O 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.009
 do not feel good the black night that also serves to think that not only 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.049
 that makes the hair bigger but I left my hair right 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.109
 it is here it can have two is with the multitasking munich functions and the other 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.349
 of giving length 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.949
 so sometimes the person wants to play well 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.429
 It is a case to say that sometimes the person 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.769
 sworn in she wants to hire the middle for example 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.969
 the delegate said that you do not need to always give one of them extensions that 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.089
 stand 1 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:14.809
 You know he never goes out, not even that thing that bothers me a little. 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:15.559
 maximum 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.079
 despite being still representative within the cabin and 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.289
 it's not very nice to have hot-headed hair 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.419
 internet caloi then the brand nokia e7 plus alessandra is awesome 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.110
 which is in the final 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.259
 is as impressed as it gets naturally exactly happened hair 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.290
 I loved it now, we come back 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.409
 stay here because I'm also going to sit down and put 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.520
 she asks 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.550
 to stay with longer hair and more people 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
 we came up and creative air 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.849
 but the 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.700
 he has price nothing heavy told bruno 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.159
 hair temperature increase the amount late 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.619
 It's multi-media and the feeling is incredible. Medium gets bigger hair but on a level. 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.529
 very good 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.199
 prove it's worth
