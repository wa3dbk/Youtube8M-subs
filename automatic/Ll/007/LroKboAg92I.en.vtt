adding at the beginning of the game
all<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.780> mod<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.229> an

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
all in all I think this mod is an

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
all in all I think this mod is an
excellent<00:01:46.920> choice<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> who

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
excellent choice for those of you who

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.730 
excellent choice for those of you who
have<00:01:47.790> played<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.420> game<00:01:48.450> multiple<00:01:49.229> times<00:01:50.600> now

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
have played the game multiple times now

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
have played the game multiple times now
obviously<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.280> complete<00:01:53.670> conflict

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
obviously this is a complete conflict

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.270 
obviously this is a complete conflict
with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.020> texture<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.530> mods<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.920> showed<00:01:56.159> in

with the texture back mods I showed in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850 
with the texture back mods I showed in
my<00:01:56.310> last<00:01:56.670> video<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.649> mod

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
my last video but it is a very good mod
