00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.310
 This is the command we expect. 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.750
 interesting intense battles first battle 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.580
 despite the bitterness of past defeats in 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.590
 the first battle lol team 1 not in a hurry 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.710
 attack the opponent and calm and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.180
 play carefully from the defense on the greens and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.860
 free zones in the city use red 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.140
 rush unity are selected in the paid 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.299
 central road and enemy base but 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.640
 don't take the last step after which 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.470
 way back there will be no risk 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.240
 teams sit back in their positions and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.310
 break into attack only a minute before 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.470
 end of the round when the risk of losing the fight 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.390
 was minimal firing steam in 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.640
 symbolic brawl teams diverge 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.010
 world 00 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 second fight in the second unity battle 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.200
 updated tab instead of the third isa 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.900
 field leaves 110 Chinese and heavy weaving 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 skips forward maneuver t69 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 it is the American C-scale that becomes 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.030
 the main acting figure of the round 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.220
 first 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.290
 Anatolich minus the firefly on the train. and those 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.270
 most plunders his way allies 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.250
 to capture the main detachment of unified 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.170
 bursts into enemy territory with 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.929
 side of the city the attention of two strands 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.030
 emoticons distracted by a dozen ren order 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.640
 Lucky Rasher hastily rush into the Chinese 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.980
 leave him with a vanshot aim 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.000
 and do not break Rena of course 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.680
 goes to the hangar 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.420
 but lost time for extra 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.000
 reloading turns for lol team 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.459
 fatal capture competent shooting 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 counterattack technology and unity opens 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.000
 score in match 10 the third fight and so the beginning 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.160
 the third battle the lol team 1 team needs 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.590
 recoup well and let's look at 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.570
 setup and it will suggest that the guys in this 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.880
 round commanded the team again does not change 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.980
 composition they are still using two 50100 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.780
 use 300 third at this event 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.519
 Selim also to their uses 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.280
 Chinese tyazh they use is-3 and 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.989
 also use 350 100 more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.820
 dynamic faster team stops 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.040
 unity with more accurate commands 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.130
 elbow well only after a little 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.829
 positional skirmish batch starts 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.019
 on and horizontal irina take 1 damage 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.579
 also answered in the racher wok this is the most 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.320
 turning point with me the main point when 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.950
 unity team understand that rivals 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.290
 are divided 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.570
 that an opponent on cade and need to attack 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.340
 urine is obtained ideally from these positions 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.590
 he was there a couple of times trying and it Tanchiki 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
 takes a position commanded tim just 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.130
 confused and they try to enter 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 try to pick up Irina leave for Renault 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.000
 take damage on the next is just 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.250
 disassembly is powerless from now on 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260
 team and lol team 1 already needed 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.120
 only thinking about the attack remains two 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.730
 round well and see if the guy can 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.250
 make a miracle and do the so-called 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.110
 comeback 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.090
 fourth fight in fourth fight both 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.950
 teams occupy the city if lol team 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.410
 quietly x-ray whether opponents then 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.210
 the ranks of unity began a real stir 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.910
 unexpected internet connection 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.300
 loses rena but continues to shine 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.770
 pancake read rivals this flew out lol and 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.240
 he shines in a fine will 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.460
 worth winning 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.260
 fucked up on returns to the battlefield and 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.900
 single keep moving in depth 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.120
 quarters first frag for theodore in 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.220
 hangar set off and rock however month 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.830
 emoticons were not long in coming 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.570
 then counterattack by 1 vertical where 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.640
 between the houses clamp the lucies to 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.890
 trade union soviet unity 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.080
 have time because of too large gaps 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.060
 tank links only 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.190
 substantial mining single becomes but 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.549
 u do not know skill on weave but for victory in 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.310
 the battle 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.990
 this was clearly not enough rising 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.090
 the spirit of the lol team crush is not battered 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.220
 enemy equipment and play one 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.440
 round 12 5 bout after intense 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.450
 interesting 4 fights I am sure that the team 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.880
 lol team 1 believe my strength a little 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.830
 and decided to drastically change the game 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.419
 principle, as a team, ute your garden and a plus 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.940
 comment scared and they don't 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.169
 use more Chinese tyazh on 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.270
 for some strange reasons 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.200
 teams lol team really changed 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.419
 your strategy 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.919
 changed their actions this time too 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.410
 commanded the team intentionally only 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.330
 attack and type win and seize the base 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.190
 rival yes and we see right away 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.410
 instant departure team leaves for 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.990
 center attack through rail 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.520
 lines and of course, but there is no one skill 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.090
 at that time still managed to break everything there 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.040
 fences 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.750
 Well, in principle, it seemed to me that 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.790
 the team must have been strong 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.140
 rival like this to start this meeting 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.200
 in the first battle 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.810
 well, as Brown has shown 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.180
 seemed very successful guys very 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.490
 clearly enter the circle of capture instantly 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.090
 very fast triple capture begins 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.280
 Well, the position of unity as it turned out guys 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.200
 Were not ready for this turn of events 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.120
 but also a lot more interesting 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.610
 situations occurred duel Anatoly 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.620
 official in the end where you play it natali 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.150
 than though at the beginning we see that she she 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.460
 one something behind his rival 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.260
 but here it is very cool played one 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.050
 order jigante calocier ashranes leave from 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.879
 whiskers burst into the day but also 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.440
 basically doing very good 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.900
 advantage is very much for the team 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.690
 did zeo being a unity rival solo 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.099
 could not notice the tank and when unity 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.960
 contour such through its base 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.330
 making the stern hands out your drum 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.280
 rivals light up rivals get 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.930
 a lot of damage and rivals end 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.419
 that's the way commanded by tim and 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.099
 was able to win this fight on the basis of 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.860
 match the title of main smoke from the dealer 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.960
 Buttercup gets his asset almost seven 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.849
 thousand damage 600 more than that 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.919
 he's closest pursuer 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.379
 becomes top scorer of the match 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.050
 7 destroyed emoticons are left behind 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.659
 seo and lacquer rascher statistical and three 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.590
 team unity draws a scout naksan 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.879
 for the match he managed to light up 11 tanks 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.099
 really fighting draw i'm not afraid 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.599
 I will not say this word that it was juicy 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.969
 Lesha match that you most 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.440
 liked it and who deserved more 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.750
 wins in this game the match was 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.550
 really interesting everything was 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.440
 not bad if not for the first round where 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.449
 the lol team played more carefully 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.190
 it seems like unity played the first number they 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.889
 interval of attack played all the same more 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.229
 aggressively but still the result was 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.060
 the one I expected the teams to 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:57.039
 get each other play well but 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.259
 there is still much to do for teams 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.020
 much to pass and much still worth 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.400
 also learn well and here it will still 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.650
 a compromising question from me on 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.449
 about 4 rounds how would you describe him in 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.940
 this match one flight solves a lot 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.710
 sometimes it happened the same way though for the first time in 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.330
 tank history apparently it was 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.669
 The most useful will result in the same player gave 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.860
 Illumination gave a lot of information but the team 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:20.680
 not handled controversial but pretty 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.840
 interesting opinion thanks Lesch Well 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.270
 teams diverge world and we are waiting for new 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.099
 battles from the best teams ru-cluster already 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.110
 in the next round we will see ukrainian 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:33.750
 dan balan last season finalists 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.750
 gaming and have c see you soon
