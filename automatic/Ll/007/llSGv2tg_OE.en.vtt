00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.540
 on 26 January 1983 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.849
 NASA launches an astronomical satellite agency 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.489
 i red 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.820
 every scientist finds something of great boundaries of our solar system 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.439
 something very big that could have been a planet 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 what strength 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:28.549
 September 10, 1984 lyrics are not logged in my house 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.310
 no recalled planet x 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.640
 when will you arrive in 2012 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 life as we know it will cease to exist 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.720
 no 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 the threat 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.090
 the twenty-first century is giving us technological advances that go 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 beyond all our greatest expectations 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280
 today we travel the planets in different ways is always faster 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.790
 thanks to modern medicine we live longer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.620
 for a lucky few of this century everything is fantastic 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.750
 however for most people life is difficult and tiring 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.130
 many people live in the desperation of those who do not have 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.270
 this suffering affects everyone, even those who have 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.840
 life goes well in the twenty-first century the benefits are many but not for everyone 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.920
 we have our careers we can shop in shopping malls full of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 goods full of light 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.189
 weight earn money effortlessly on nothing 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.779
 we go to the university to have a good position in the hope of 

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.209
 being able to pay in the course of life 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.859
 the debts we make as students 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.879
 we have to pay our debts before we retire 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.269
 we can have fun with our neighbors 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.379
 or pretend to have fun alone 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.300
 make luxury holidays to escape the stress of our lives for a moment 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.229
 daily 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.729
 therefore to those who are comfortable knowing that life will no longer exist in the future 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:34.699
 also if it were really true because they don't say it on television 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.569
 before the new millennium, journalists and research analysts 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.829
 they talked of tsunamis of storms of floods of earthquakes of waves of 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.129
 hot 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.559
 these natural cataclysms have always been part of us 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.299
 mankind 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.679
 It's like a variable 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.829
 we already know that there will always be some problems somewhere 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:02.299
 all this until hurricane katrina devastated new orleans in 2005 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.669
 our attention is sharpened after this unexpected sudden wind 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.009
 after katrina people are television experts 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:16.239
 Talk about megatsunami Super floods Mega earthquakes Waves of hot killer 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.669
 always bigger events 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.369
 then we can ask ourselves why all these superlatives these 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.999
 adjectives are gradually inserted into the common language to avoid creating 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.260
 fear and panic the television uses this language makes it acceptable inside 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.729
 each of us 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.269
 we can ask ourselves there is something beyond all this after the tragic 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.409
 loss of life following the sumatra tsunami the super earthquake in December 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.859
 2004 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.499
 we have observed that suggestions and precautions are broadcasted 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.499
 I'm on my earthquakes than ever before 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.359
 mystics spread in all parts of the planet are putting a strain on 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.359
 plant and animal world together with human beings 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.049
 let us observe how the lands are lost at an unheard-of speed 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.109
 city â€‹â€‹notes are taking very strict precautions on water savings for 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.089
 conserve the water reserves that are running out of our waterways 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.689
 they are drying up because there are many uncontrollable fires in the water 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.370
 is used for this some of these fires are so sufficient that they obscure 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.290
 with their smoke entire regions 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.300
 generally for the Americans, August and September have always been 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.740
 dedicated to the last holidays by the organization for the return of the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.569
 boys at school 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.819
 now it is a question of avoiding 20 dangerous ones 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.349
 because another pagan katrina could easily happen again 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.009
 the violence of these storms can be weather changes 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:41.960
 good 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.240
 but the damage caused could take years if not decades to be absorbed 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.349
 the people involved in these storms will experience an indescribable pain 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:56.269
 those who lived them refer to these events as hell on earth 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.860
 although there are promises of assistance and help from many 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.849
 nations 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.969
 these are not maintained 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.439
 oo also for those who are not directly involved in these events 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.439
 catastrophic of economic consequences will be grateful 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.300
 it is possible not to perceive earthquakes and storms directly however 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.190
 we will feel the rise in prices of raw material costs is inevitable 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.729
 moreover, very often the populations affected by these events become prey 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.030
 of people who tend to take advantage of the situation to plunder 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.110
 further 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.900
 at the same time those who deal with global warming there 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 they assure that a natural cycle affirms that it always happened 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.789
 you like yaris because they melt 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.270
 and that these events will not affect humanity or that they will have 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.639
 limited consequences 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.940
 these characters tend to calm us by throwing smoke into each other 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:50.999
 eyes 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.439
 they say that the best thing we can do is not to believe 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.439
 to our eyes and our feelings 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.589
 we must ask ourselves 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.169
 what will have to happen so that we can really believe what 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.969
 we have before our eyes 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.710
 when we finally open our eyes we begin to feel the connection 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:11.709
 three natural disasters and human behavior 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.520
 then we can consider some examples 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.580
 like that old pipe burst in a new york street 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.499
 strangely this not so devastating event 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.769
 received an unusual media attention nationwide 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.139
 but this event was indeed an accidental disaster 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.650
 I have the Minneapolis bridge of the 35th street collapsed involving many 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.999
 human lives that too is a disaster worthy of probable attention 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.499
 it was known that the structure of this will point to fragile 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.649
 but the same experts were astonished and amazed by the speed and gravity 

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:50.729
 event 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.150
 the truth is that many of the American infrastructure in the rest of the 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.259
 world are old deteriorated 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.119
 and we cannot continue to repaint forever 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.819
 these deteriorate because it has been verified by scientists that it exists 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.819
 a constant seismic movement at very low intensity 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.360
 what is causing this seismic activity 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.910
 we can imagine that our infrastructure like our biosphere 

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:20.680
 weakened are being damaged 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.770
 the responsibility in part of the man and his behaviors but a part of 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.020
 responsibility about our own planet 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.270
 the earth is involved in something bigger that is happening 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.379
 within our solar system 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.289
 anything in space 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.979
 a large object called planet x 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:41.180
 that is approaching the heart of our solar system 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.330
 in the previous passages it caused the cataclysms 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.710
 2 in 2012 his presence will determine moment 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.199
 this can be true 

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:56.279
 if you want to believe your eyes there is scientific evidence
