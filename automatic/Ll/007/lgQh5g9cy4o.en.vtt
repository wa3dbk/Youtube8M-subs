00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you now back to Aero TV I'll show you a

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.460 
you now back to Aero TV I'll show you a
little<00:04:01.580> bit<00:04:01.880> of<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.900> know<00:04:03.050> before<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.380> go

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
little bit of the know before you go

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.020 
little bit of the know before you go
course<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.500> first<00:04:06.980> act<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.610> course<00:04:07.850> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
course so the first act of the course is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.150 
course so the first act of the course is
loading<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:08.900> call<00:04:09.110> them<00:04:09.200> acts<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.680> scenes<00:04:09.890> you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
loading we call them acts and scenes you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.830 
loading we call them acts and scenes you
can<00:04:10.310> call<00:04:10.520> them<00:04:10.610> chapters<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.210> pages<00:04:11.630> but

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
can call them chapters and pages but

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.470 
can call them chapters and pages but
it's<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.230> same<00:04:12.440> idea<00:04:13.000> I'm<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.240> show<00:04:14.420> you

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
it's the same idea I'm going to show you

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.229 
it's the same idea I'm going to show you
some<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:15.020> Act<00:04:15.800> three<00:04:16.040> because<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.850> shows<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
some of Act three because it shows the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.020 
some of Act three because it shows the
airspace<00:04:17.630> basics<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.670> just<00:04:19.670> how<00:04:19.820> we're

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
airspace basics and just how we're

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.360 
airspace basics and just how we're
presenting<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:20.570> information<00:04:21.130> we<00:04:22.130> sit<00:04:22.340> down

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
presenting this information we sit down

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.890 
presenting this information we sit down
and<00:04:22.580> we<00:04:22.640> talked<00:04:22.850> about<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.570> know<00:04:23.660> what<00:04:23.840> do

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and we talked about you know what do

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.650 
and we talked about you know what do
people<00:04:24.230> need<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.410> know<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:25.760> basically<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
people need to know it's basically a

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.540 
people need to know it's basically a
task<00:04:26.930> analysis<00:04:27.560> what<00:04:27.770> does<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.010> pilot<00:04:28.340> need

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
task analysis what does the pilot need

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.000 
task analysis what does the pilot need
to<00:04:28.730> know<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:28.940> perform<00:04:29.420> this<00:04:29.570> task<00:04:29.810> safely<00:04:30.410> what

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
to know to perform this task safely what

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.900 
to know to perform this task safely what
does<00:04:31.100> somebody<00:04:31.220> need<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.580> know<00:04:31.820> about

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
does somebody need to know about

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.510 
does somebody need to know about
airspace<00:04:32.470> as<00:04:33.470> David<00:04:33.860> mentioned<00:04:33.950> we<00:04:34.220> try<00:04:34.400> not

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
airspace as David mentioned we try not

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.280 
airspace as David mentioned we try not
to<00:04:34.580> regurgitate<00:04:34.940> something<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.900> you'd<00:04:36.020> find

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
to regurgitate something that you'd find

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.780 
to regurgitate something that you'd find
in<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.770> regulations<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:40.010> here<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.550> an<00:04:40.700> example

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
in the regulations so here is an example

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.690 
in the regulations so here is an example
of<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.590> first<00:04:42.590> discussion<00:04:43.040> about<00:04:43.310> airspace

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
of that first discussion about airspace

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.490 
of that first discussion about airspace
we<00:04:43.910> talk<00:04:44.090> there's<00:04:44.540> really<00:04:44.750> two<00:04:45.050> basic

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
we talk there's really two basic

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.410 
we talk there's really two basic
categories<00:04:45.730> communication<00:04:46.730> required<00:04:47.120> and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
categories communication required and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.810 
categories communication required and
communication<00:04:48.350> recommended<00:04:48.950> instead<00:04:49.700> of

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
communication recommended instead of

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.390 
communication recommended instead of
just<00:04:49.970> starting<00:04:50.270> off<00:04:50.590> ABCDE<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:52.070> felt<00:04:52.310> like

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
just starting off ABCDE we felt like

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.920 
just starting off ABCDE we felt like
this<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.730> simpler<00:04:53.180> way<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.450> start<00:04:53.840> out

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
this is a simpler way to start out

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.870 
this is a simpler way to start out
learning<00:04:54.290> air<00:04:54.530> space<00:04:54.770> or<00:04:55.010> refreshing<00:04:55.640> your

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
learning air space or refreshing your

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.820 
learning air space or refreshing your
knowledge<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> air<00:04:56.420> space<00:04:59.440> and<00:05:00.440> just<00:05:00.740> a

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
knowledge of air space and just a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.190 
knowledge of air space and just a
comparison<00:05:01.520> people<00:05:01.850> learn<00:05:02.060> by<00:05:02.450> comparing

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
comparison people learn by comparing

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.570 
comparison people learn by comparing
things<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:03.800> try<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.070> take<00:05:04.190> advantage<00:05:04.220> of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
things so we try and take advantage of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.910 
things so we try and take advantage of
that<00:05:04.700> where<00:05:04.910> appropriate<00:05:05.380> we<00:05:06.380> offer<00:05:06.560> quick

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
that where appropriate we offer quick

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.830 
that where appropriate we offer quick
reference<00:05:07.190> guides<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.150> people<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:08.570> print

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
reference guides that people can print

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.160 
reference guides that people can print
off<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.230> keep<00:05:09.380> with<00:05:09.620> them<00:05:10.840> but<00:05:11.840> here's<00:05:12.050> an

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
off and keep with them but here's an

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.510 
off and keep with them but here's an
example<00:05:12.410> we're<00:05:12.710> going<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.890> start<00:05:13.100> with<00:05:13.250> class

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
example we're going to start with class

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.790 
example we're going to start with class
d<00:05:13.790> airspace<00:05:14.000> which<00:05:14.510> sounds<00:05:15.050> strange<00:05:15.590> why

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
d airspace which sounds strange why

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.070 
d airspace which sounds strange why
would<00:05:15.950> we<00:05:16.040> start<00:05:16.310> with<00:05:16.430> Class<00:05:16.640> D<00:05:16.720> but<00:05:17.720> we<00:05:17.930> are

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
would we start with Class D but we are

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.810 
would we start with Class D but we are
starting<00:05:18.440> with<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.770> communication<00:05:19.400> required

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
starting with the communication required

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.730 
starting with the communication required
airspace<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.630> we<00:05:20.780> decided<00:05:21.230> to<00:05:21.320> start<00:05:21.530> with

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
airspace and we decided to start with

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.370 
airspace and we decided to start with
this<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.340> least<00:05:22.880> complex<00:05:23.480> or<00:05:23.720> spaced<00:05:24.020> first

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
this the least complex or spaced first

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.380 
this the least complex or spaced first
so<00:05:25.130> we<00:05:25.220> go<00:05:25.370> from<00:05:25.400> D<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:26.120> C<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.750> be<00:05:27.700> in<00:05:28.700> an<00:05:28.910> example

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
so we go from D to C to be in an example

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.840 
so we go from D to C to be in an example
of<00:05:29.540> you<00:05:29.780> know<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.740> interactive<00:05:31.520> medium

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
of you know the the interactive medium

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.390 
of you know the the interactive medium
that<00:05:32.030> we<00:05:32.120> have<00:05:32.470> we<00:05:33.470> go<00:05:33.620> from<00:05:33.830> viewing<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.280> on<00:05:34.340> a

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
that we have we go from viewing it on a

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.450 
that we have we go from viewing it on a
chart<00:05:34.790> to<00:05:35.120> viewing<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.690> in<00:05:35.720> 3d<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:37.310> is

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
chart to viewing it in 3d and this is

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.950 
chart to viewing it in 3d and this is
important<00:05:37.970> because<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:38.270> is<00:05:38.390> how<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.540> pilot's

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
important because this is how a pilot's

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.660 
important because this is how a pilot's
going<00:05:39.080> to<00:05:39.140> experience<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.920> it<00:05:40.130> takes<00:05:40.460> some<00:05:40.610> of

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
going to experience it it takes some of

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.520 
going to experience it it takes some of
that<00:05:40.880> translation<00:05:41.450> from<00:05:41.750> looking<00:05:42.140> at<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.410> on<00:05:42.500> a

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
that translation from looking at it on a

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.350 
that translation from looking at it on a
chart<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.980> visualizing<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:44.180> actually

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
chart to visualizing it and actually

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.050 
chart to visualizing it and actually
flying<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.460> what<00:05:46.460> we're<00:05:46.610> really<00:05:46.790> looking

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
flying in it what we're really looking

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.940 
flying in it what we're really looking
at<00:05:47.390> is

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
at is

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.340
