00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.790
 today there is something special that I am 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.719
 on the way and do not stand at the stove 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.719
 but behind the camera 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.940
 I 'm to dave and I'll show you today 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.370
 how to prepare a wrong one 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.480
 See you in the kitchen so what 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.310
 we need a wrong game 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.140
 directed or even a molecular one 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.150
 to make players we start with 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.350
 the yolk because we need a mango 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.400
 maracuja juice some water star anise 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.199
 alginate and calcium lactate and see here 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.690
 you need the ingredients of the protein there 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.330
 we are a natural yoghurt and walk zero 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.250
 either buy yourself in the discounter where 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.079
 the power as well as day and buys you in 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.690
 own from water cane sugar and 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.770
 analyzed the exact preparation of the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.770
 you find in the infobox 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.790
 the first thing we put the yolk ago 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.100
 for this hits the specified 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.119
 amount of water and dissolves the alginate in it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.040
 while the alginate dissolves 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 I'll tell you something molecular 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 cooking is molecular cooking at last 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.790
 is a kind of modern cookery the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.060
 dealing with biochemical and 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.500
 physical processes busy in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.390
 the molecular kitchen becomes the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.369
 Aggregate state and the appearance of 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 products modified with the plot to 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.970
 play 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.530
 eg has an update to lie and yours 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.810
 brain remembers the taste 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.540
 What is called in here and that tastes good 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.729
 suddenly after tomato that spoils the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.920
 of course, in the first moment, think about one 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.350
 funny way or as in ours 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.939
 For example, you see a mirage but it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.810
 Tastes like mango after a break 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.810
 maracuja good 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.310
 then we give the mango maracuja juice 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 Add and cook the whole thing once 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.470
 and this there is no victory and lump 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 to avoid and now we have to be patient 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.830
 be and put the yolk in the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.390
 fridge this completely cooled 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 Meanwhile, we take care of three white 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 then we take the vanilla syrup and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.390
 your yogurt 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.709
 we'll just solve the next step 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.040
 calcium lactate in water on very whole 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 important if you do not tap water 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.769
 tap water just has too much 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.209
 calcium and this would affect the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.209
 trigger chemical process 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.520
 now it will be exciting our age 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.440
 Keep it over a trowel there 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.240
 the egg yolk into it and let it into the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.240
 calcium lactate glide in there 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.310
 After a fine layer around our 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.680
 egg yolk will take off 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:15.410
 water the lactate and rinse it again 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 in fresh clear water and like it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.190
 to be heard for a mirror egg 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.019
 in the pan on board we take the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.780
 yogurt distribute it to a global one 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.790
 plex form a small hollow and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 last there own to be careful 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.160
 and as you see our dessert you 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.579
 amazingly similar to a mirror egg 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.579
 out 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.630
 from 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.250
 How did you like the video? 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.050
 including it in the comments 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:15.960
 dave and I would be feedback ourselves 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:15.960
 Today I'm on the road 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 by cook today think now 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.650
 a bit friendly to look at
