00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 with all that force that demonstrates the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 electronic music we find ourselves with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.250

 with my career not to join the dj and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 Well here I am giving you giving me the common 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.280
 is to see the men who are the people 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 that mix the people who put him 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 the rhythm the music but a woman like 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.020
 was born that to see you are 20 years old but 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.829
 I imagine you started at an early age 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.830
 and I started when I was 15 years old 15 and 8 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:11.250
 years thanks to my brother for good 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.380
 it was December with me has supported me 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.620
 and thanks to him I am being with my 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.490
 race and you can go there giving him all 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 the days and thanks 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.799
 proud 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.679
 after the concerts I was going to be human 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.170
 as he knew this contract so that 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.360
 I'm going to put music is all always behind 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.890
 of him while he although I never like 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.740
 I liked it, well, take me because that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.350
 it's not a lot of people much to know about 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.069
 heroes and sisters and then there is no or there 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.470
 with him the first time I went to a 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.349
 contract was a disco but he did not 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.200
 he said he was going to go I be like I used to 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.959
 introduce myself and then later I get the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.569
 surprise that you make music for the first 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.950
 once in a nightclub 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.650
 I felt happy and happy a little 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.959
 nervous about people because of people 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.549
 because I had never mixed but it's going 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.549
 to go through the windows too much 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.400
 people, I felt very well and I felt 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.470
 well and happy because my brother never 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.010
 I expected that I would do this for me what 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.010
 what do you like 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550
 I like it 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.520
 the music and you can do what I do 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.490
 I like that people listen 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.209
 I love when people listen to my 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.830
 mixtures dance 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.930
 with me since he does not look at me anymore because 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.890
 these moods that have their place apart 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.750
 from the common stores tell me he knows 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.180
 a rewarding one that is doing something what 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.520
 that you like but what goals or what to 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.990
 future you want to do or where you want 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.970
 arrive 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.240
 my goals are professional and 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.660
 professional 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.850
 is to move forward and then it has 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.620
 recognized a little more good they told me 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.480
 that he had left for moments 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.550
 momentarily it is the profession for the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.810
 I challenge you more but always when one says 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.270
 one defeat plus the return with more 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.380
 force 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.620
 if I come with much more encouragement to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.040
 this 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.840
 if you tell me, he had as a woman 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.360
 you say since this genre few 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.980
 very few are the ones in this 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.530
 profession as a woman who says to those 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.170
 women who are like you brave I decided 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.720
 enterprising so keep going forward 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.900
 will be a woman djs the cutest but of 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.480
 heart decided and then move on 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.879
 that if you have the support of family members 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.030
 that they go ahead and with the help of 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.769
 god all and everything is achieved the whole people 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.239
 the family that is watching you in this 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.989
 moment and people feel Sunday that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.350

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.540
 health and prepared the family and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.510

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.720
 with you it will be observation mixing and 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.060
 you can learn not like that if it's easy yes 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.800
 yes, it's easy because you do not have at least 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.470
 he has pleasant likes to have the style 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.880
 musical as the song the dancing the 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.680
 horse that always dances another camera 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.740
 of the channel she can also mix 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.180

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.680
 total in an invitation to tatiana 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.870
 while we only wait, look 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.720

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.610
 you like to mix in a team class 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.310
 in compacteras and for the moment now 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.520
 I'm practicing computer 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.350
 computer in abstract because by the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.330
 moment if I'm there although I hope 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.810
 means then it will continue with more 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.390
 that before using the competencies 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.190
 maybe it's also because the world is going 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.350
 moving forward and always invent things 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.810
 new to make it easier for 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.940
 design if this one I think more successes 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.440

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.440
 use other than being human 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.480
