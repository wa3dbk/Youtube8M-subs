00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.820
 cash does not pay that here and there 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.250
 Actually, something else is suspected 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 normal for 69 cents a piece 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820
 Bought 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 look what you actually are in it 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 I do the other one too I think 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 when a figure is in that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 another one in there just look like that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 separate the chocolate and the yellow from the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 A normal shake is not so here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.070
 is not a smurf inside definitely say 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.740
 me no 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 and here is something to assemble 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.270
 look at us all the time it looks up 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.270
 This dragster sprint 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 how we build all together I 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.329
 I have this little motor then I have 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.250
 the russians left here is open where 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.399
 The artwork is a bit small me 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.890
 Do not really realize that now 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:43.390
 point or otherwise somehow it has to 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.390
 but that's the only way to go 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:54.770
 yes, even then comes the front axle 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:56.420
 or the must come and then 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.670
 I've actually only here the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.939
 Something needs to be massaged out somehow 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.899
 whatever it is supposed to hold now 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.899
 here and there and and not so out again 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.629
 Of course I caught that way 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.910
 he sprinted that for one 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.910
 designation 050 a 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.250
 we come to the next from the 2 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.410
 here could be one more time 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:38.269
 Smurf everyday in there too 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.889
 again a yellow normal standard so 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.780
 hardly anything to hear now that could happen 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.950
 gargamel be that has also nick rattles 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.980
 or a papa smurf for example and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.019
 and it's one of those again 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.540
 funny yes looks like a little one 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:59.209
 I am sure that this is often the case 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:03.130
 said so what do we have here the new one 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:11.060
 year good these funny flying things 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.360
 ft 067 the leaflet in duplicate 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 execution or what 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:22.310
 an extra breed yes this is this one 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.800
 flyer drive man at my middle 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.180
 you rooted that so in there 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.250
 that's how it looks and then you should 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.500
 The thing can throw itself that is itself 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.140
 At least I can go crazy 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.480
 only if you are here 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.800
 Pictures looks at the right fun factor 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.600
 that should have whether you look at the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.550
 to help each other or that too 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.810
 I can not say anything here 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.150
 it so that the things around the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.950
 Bet throws the farthest flies 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.130
 no idea, you can also take stones 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.790
 well one or the other is the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.380
 top will make fun here in the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.380
 I think sprinting is much better 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.590

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.390

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:35.990

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:39.010
 ribery wins the ball and passed to 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.270

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.350

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.779
