 february 100 their positions in the air smell 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 no spring is a great reason to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.670
 shake up your life good morning this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 program with a new home TV channel 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.100
 Russia today 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.100
 we are preparing for spring 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 let's say inappropriate with closer 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.970
 and the smell we still feel before 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.650
 feel and we are their home our ready for 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.260
 spring mood to visit me 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.420
 today she is dear to anyone who knows 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.910
 how to make spring 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.180
 mood did not leave our homes never 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:01.340
 and on the track good today I will tell 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.010
 how to make such a wonderful flower 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.720
 spring as a hyacinth made of polymer clay 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.900
 that is, for this we need 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.710
 polymer clay tools themselves 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.500
 wire 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 Mine stain glue hand cream 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.869
 pliers scissors butt tape tape 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.820
 the same is done to begin with we 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 we prepare stamens we take approximately 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.020
 captivity and not knead and yellow runs 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.470
 best oil paint now 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.570
 use the blank here I already have 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.820
 cork with an eyelet at the end 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.159
 That you bent her pre- sale 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.890
 with got to what to cling to and nothing 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.789
 It is not capable of types of resist and the holy 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.570
 that white glue dunk drops poryuyu 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:53.119
 glue and without glue that polymer clay 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.119
 does not display consonantly enough 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.640
 let's say this stamen yes that is here 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.240
 form a small piece around our 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.670
 loops and you get so than those of us 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
 need somewhere around 40 for anal hyacinth 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 prepare well what to do next 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.160
 then we make the flower itself it too 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 worth of stages I think that 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.040
 I'll take a little help now 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.100
 a piece of clay and roll a ball on the palm 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.650
 we get a ball about diameter 1 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.210
 centimeter and roll out then formed 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.660
 burgundy thread gift custody 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.690
 a little bit pull out masha throw 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.940
 to take consistent and scissor 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.460
 our six-piece drop is desirable 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.370
 wounds from the island it's near the island to 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.880
 blunt composite to the end or she is not 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 leave leaving it to hang there and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.040
 each part for another 3 get rule 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.250
 to protect turned out very narrow 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 not yet cut into six pieces 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.820
 now we need the main 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 tool for working roughly clay this 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.960
 the joint at this stage we will need 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.360
 hand cream to prevent clay from sticking to 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.400
 hands and to the tool it's us a little bit 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.670
 grease finger here it is 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.689
 here indicate index yes and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.239
 are located . between big and 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:21.129
 index finger put the stack in the center 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.019
 flower and push for us 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.870
 each piece makes it kind of double 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.870
 understood correctly 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.870
 of 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.200
 now we bend the whole of it straight 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.590
 lamb do he needs a little bit 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.170
 dry up because damn well alive and with 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.540
 cannot work further 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.120
 leave to dry after 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.870
 a little flower dries then you can 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.050
 already paste 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.290
 the middle we take our billet 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.860
 also dunk in play so look you already 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.800
 dried out 6.6 and trying out the costume and 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.940
 pre- lubricated with pva glue 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.770
 donut the other end of the stick 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.780
 but it is not quite so high as yet 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.760
 you could pierce right right up 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.550
 better that he was not quite dry 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.459
 from the test I understand now to make 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:22.160
 I play a bouquet so that the flower can live 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.520
 lose your mind but do it 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.260
 pipes 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.650
 tell in general the eyes are afraid hands 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.640
 do as it is known but here is one flower 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.190
 thing takes time 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.010
 but let's be honest bath course there 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.140
 a blank that consists of this one 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.820
 flower beds are pre- made and remain 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.140
 only collect them in one hyacinth this 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.690
 speaking himself thinks it is not much 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.040
 easier than what we do with you 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.400
 colossal work at least not from scratch 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.530
 60 and it's just as well, it is unthinkable 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.530
 here it is quite possible to get 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.500
 how she drove 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:08.490
 little flower is almost ready wow this 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:10.470
 yes, but I did not find it here 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.130
 what has not yet dried you understood it immediately 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.729
 learned by perfection of forms and 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.580
 thank you it is very nice great well that 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.960
 amazing art of course 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.710
 troublesome and makes i understand but worth 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.449
 taro that is left to this flower 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.060
 make an arc trunk and and leaflets in 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.550
 you have enough finished form here 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.039
 patience such a bouquet will please you 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.039
 throughout the year they are only on the threshold
