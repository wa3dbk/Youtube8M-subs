you are I think it was so despite the

you are I think it was so despite the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
stuff um Luna drivers are actually

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.039 
stuff um Luna drivers are actually
pretty<00:03:10.890> safe<00:03:11.159> but<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.670> risk<00:03:12.000> increases<00:03:12.239> four

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
pretty safe but the risk increases four

really<00:03:32.159> I<00:03:32.609> mean<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.629> could<00:03:33.870> say<00:03:34.140> twenty

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
really I mean you could say twenty

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.490 
when I finally get a little alone time
behind<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.340> wheel

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
behind the wheel

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.420 
behind the wheel
I<00:04:28.360> can<00:04:29.360> make<00:04:29.570> this

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.279 

the<00:04:36.430> factors<00:04:36.970> teenagers<00:04:37.630> brains<00:04:37.810> are<00:04:38.139> still

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
the factors teenagers brains are still

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.159 
the factors teenagers brains are still
developing<00:04:38.610> their<00:04:39.610> prefrontal<00:04:40.120> cortex<00:04:40.810> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
developing their prefrontal cortex the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.570 
developing their prefrontal cortex the
part<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.620> brain<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:42.009> helps<00:04:42.280> us<00:04:42.400> make

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
part of the brain that helps us make

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.430 
part of the brain that helps us make
rational<00:04:42.850> decisions<00:04:43.229> isn't<00:04:44.229> fully

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
rational decisions isn't fully

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.200 
rational decisions isn't fully
functioning<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.610> means<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:45.970> orientation

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
functioning that means the orientation

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.900 
functioning that means the orientation
to<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> risks<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.560> dangers<00:04:47.740> associated<00:04:48.460> with

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
to the risks and dangers associated with

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.460 
to the risks and dangers associated with
driving<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.479> very<00:04:49.539> different<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.500> an<00:04:50.650> OPS

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
driving is very different to an OPS

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.540 
driving is very different to an OPS
so<00:04:53.470> if<00:04:53.560> teenagers<00:04:54.039> brains<00:04:54.190> are<00:04:54.490> still

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
so if teenagers brains are still

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.400 
so if teenagers brains are still
developing<00:04:54.699> how<00:04:55.600> does<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.810> affect<00:04:56.169> them<00:04:56.289> as

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
developing how does this affect them as

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.620 
developing how does this affect them as

welcome<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.860> surviving<00:05:15.280> teen<00:05:15.460> driving<00:05:15.820> we're

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
welcome to surviving teen driving we're

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.920 
welcome to surviving teen driving we're
going<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> be<00:05:16.210> doing<00:05:16.330> some<00:05:16.570> quite<00:05:16.780> interesting

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
going to be doing some quite interesting

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.290 
going to be doing some quite interesting
things<00:05:17.320> but<00:05:18.099> first<00:05:18.430> off<00:05:18.669> what<00:05:18.910> we're<00:05:19.030> gonna<00:05:19.120> do

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.540 
things but first off what we're gonna do
is<00:05:19.389> test<00:05:19.599> your<00:05:19.780> calibration<00:05:20.289> skills<00:05:20.800> so<00:05:21.130> I'm

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
is test your calibration skills so I'm

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.490 
is test your calibration skills so I'm
gonna<00:05:21.669> ask<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.240> tell<00:05:22.449> me<00:05:22.599> how<00:05:22.900> far<00:05:23.229> you

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
gonna ask you to tell me how far you

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.779 
gonna ask you to tell me how far you
would<00:05:23.650> need<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.919> drop<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.130> car<00:05:24.400> how<00:05:24.639> many

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
would need to drop a car how many

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.540 
would need to drop a car how many
stories<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.539> replicate<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.289> collision<00:05:26.830> at<00:05:27.070> 50

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
stories to replicate a collision at 50

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.270 
stories to replicate a collision at 50
kilometres<00:05:27.970> per<00:05:28.000> hour

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:41.790 

the<00:05:31.280> answer<00:05:31.729> is<00:05:32.030> four<00:05:32.419> stories<00:05:32.720> high

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:54.890 

imagine<00:05:42.800> being<00:05:43.060> examined<00:05:44.060> by<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:45.140> scary

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.930 

look<00:05:55.900> at<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.110> damage<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.680> that's<00:05:57.040> just<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.460> 50

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
look at the damage and that's just a 50
