00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
these are molded on it's not just paint
I<00:02:17.600> think<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.870> little<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.800> would<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.040> looked

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
I think a little it would have looked

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.520 
I think a little it would have looked
weird<00:02:19.640> otherwise<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.480> we're<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.170> going<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
weird otherwise but we're just going to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.410 
weird otherwise but we're just going to
take<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.280> vest<00:02:22.490> off<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.910> pinion

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
take the vest off the pinion

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.880 
take the vest off the pinion
don't<00:02:25.420> force<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:26.050> very<00:02:26.200> careful<00:02:26.770> when

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
don't force it be very careful when

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.260 
don't force it be very careful when
you're<00:02:27.010> pulling<00:02:27.400> off<00:02:27.550> you'll<00:02:27.850> want<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.030> snap

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
you're pulling off you'll want to snap

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.980 
you're pulling off you'll want to snap
the<00:02:28.450> auditory<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.030> am<00:02:31.150> correct<00:02:31.360> he<00:02:31.660> didn't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
the auditory if I am correct he didn't

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.680 
the auditory if I am correct he didn't
come<00:02:32.710> with<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.400> large<00:02:33.670> elbow<00:02:34.060> pad<00:02:34.270> actually

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
come with the large elbow pad actually

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.870 
come with the large elbow pad actually
had<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.900> add<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.430> think<00:02:36.760> that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
had that add them on but I think that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.040 
had that add them on but I think that
would<00:02:36.940> have<00:02:37.060> been<00:02:37.180> cool<00:02:37.330> had<00:02:37.600> he<00:02:37.720> came<00:02:37.870> with

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
would have been cool had he came with

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.140 
would have been cool had he came with
them<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.890> let's<00:02:39.070> take<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> look<00:02:39.640> at<00:02:39.760> Space<00:02:40.120> Camp

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
them so let's take a look at Space Camp

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.370 
them so let's take a look at Space Camp
first<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.600> good<00:02:43.870> feasel

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
first and I think it is a good feasel

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.530 
first and I think it is a good feasel
hex<00:02:44.590> game<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.880> doesn't<00:02:46.060> look<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.300> him<00:02:48.540> looks

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
hex game it doesn't look like him looks

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.840 
hex game it doesn't look like him looks
a<00:02:49.660> little<00:02:49.780> bit<00:02:49.990> older

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
a little bit older

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.820 
a little bit older
there<00:02:51.850> might<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.000> an<00:02:52.180> expression<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.650> just

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
there might be an expression but it just

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.230 
there might be an expression but it just
looks<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.130> little<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.430> older<00:02:54.459> than<00:02:54.730> what<00:02:55.030> at

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
looks a little bit older than what at

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
looks a little bit older than what at
this<00:02:55.390> time

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
this time

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.400

this<00:04:17.170> molding<00:04:18.170> that<00:04:18.290> goes<00:04:18.350> 360<00:04:19.040> all<00:04:19.190> around

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
this molding that goes 360 all around

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.970 
this molding that goes 360 all around
just<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:20.239> really<00:04:20.480> awesome<00:04:20.660> down<00:04:21.560> there<00:04:21.620> up

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
just just really awesome down there up

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.640 
just just really awesome down there up
along<00:04:22.310> baggy<00:04:23.030> pants<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.050> side<00:04:24.320> they

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
along baggy pants and on the side they

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310 
along baggy pants and on the side they
have<00:04:24.860> legal<00:04:25.370> tassels<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.200> would

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
have legal tassels and I think it would

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.540 
have legal tassels and I think it would
have<00:04:27.380> been<00:04:27.440> really<00:04:27.620> cool<00:04:27.710> had<00:04:27.980> they<00:04:28.130> painted

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.749 
I guess we'll give it a 9 out of 10 I
think<00:05:54.689> the<00:05:55.289> only<00:05:55.439> problem<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:56.129> honestly<00:05:56.520> had
