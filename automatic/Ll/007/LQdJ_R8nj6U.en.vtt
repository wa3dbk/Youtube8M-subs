00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
talking what we were trying to say is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.469 
talking what we were trying to say is
wrap<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.340> wrap<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
wrap it around so you wrap it around and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.530 
wrap it around so you wrap it around and
we<00:01:42.630> decided<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> cut<00:01:43.590> pits<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> armpit<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we decided to cut pits for the armpit so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
we decided to cut pits for the armpit so
that<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.020> dress<00:01:46.259> would<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.649> higher<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that the dress would go higher on the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
that the dress would go higher on the
doll<00:01:47.549> that's<00:01:47.880> totally<00:01:48.570> optional<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.409> think

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
doll that's totally optional but I think

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.569 
doll that's totally optional but I think
it<00:01:49.890> helps<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.549> lot<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:54.140> take<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:56.030> cut<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> notch

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
it helps a lot so take it cut a notch

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
it helps a lot so take it cut a notch
where<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.820> going<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> off<00:02:01.380> your<00:02:01.530> doll
