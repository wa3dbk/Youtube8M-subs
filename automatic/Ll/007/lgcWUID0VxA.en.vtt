00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.710
 the one I talk too quickly and 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.170
 so we will try to solve it we do 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.229
 a nice breath this nice stuffy nose me 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.720

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.310
 calm, calm and calm 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.410
 said this guys still left a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.420
 secular comments on this video I apologize if 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.430
 I'll be a little off but obviously 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.160
 whole school sore throat headache 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.830
 fever, you name it more 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.520
 come to see me so I'm covered 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 we say this way and only here for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.430
 present the main news of the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 week 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.090
 Well today is a special episode 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.780
 minecraft was officially 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.229
 purchased today 13 September 2014 from 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.870
 microsoft for a figure around 2.5 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.540
 billions of dollars appears more and more 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.299
 It is clear that the big companies are focusing 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.280
 very much on the video game industry and 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 of videogame communication is enough 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.960
 think that in recent months facebook 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.659
 purchased niche because the famous one 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.229
 glasses that you all saw magical 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.799
 amazon has purchased tweets of its own 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.799
 today microsoft has bought 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 minecraft 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.420
 but what will be the novelties of the new 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 minecraft with microsoft website 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 certainly many things will change 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.070
 many things will change because microsoft 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.710
 has a fairly strict policy 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.070
 concerning some things for example 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.800
 minecraft is written in java language 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.180
 which is a language that turns out to be 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.340
 very very heavy for some PCs 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.990
 medium low quality 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 therefore there will be better ones 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.670
 performance maybe even changing 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.800
 development language system minecraft 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.170
 there will also be optimizations 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.670
 for performance on other systems 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 operational such as the sun 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.370
 operating linux which still has many 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.610
 difficulty precisely with minecraft ci 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.470
 they will obviously be of the cons because if 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.600
 on the one hand we have this new one 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.890
 introduction of new languages 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.930
 writing of mines that there will be 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.200
 losses of virtually all fashions 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.709
 all the plugins or all the tools in fact 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.970
 written in java there will be one more 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.050
 development 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.640
 as for the new fashions that 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.590
 however it will be very long as it is necessary 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.620
 first know exactly how it is 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.170
 structured the game another novelty that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.500
 not everyone likes it is the fact that 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.340
 Microsoft has a very strict policy 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.930
 as for users who use crack 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.140
 so as for minecraft 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.910
 precisely minecraft s p could also 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.120
 giving oneself is a hypothesis with 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.270
 the acquisition by Microsoft al 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.340
 point of this game come totally 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.170
 abolished the sp because precisely boot 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.050
 considered with the trek of the game there 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.970
 they could be the cons that would be 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.600
 loss of the gaming community he has 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.220
 funds would trust to pay 20 euros for 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.489
 this game since he preferred precisely 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.130
 use microsoft sp but there will be 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.290
 also of its own such as that 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.000
 authentication on the servers will be more 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.710
 fast and more efficient and above all 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.020
 Safer 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 the servers will be totally premium e 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.850
 more users who legally purchase the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.790
 game means more money from 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.960
 part of microsoft and e of minecraft e 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.600
 this can lead to an increase in work 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.220
 in the development phase of the next 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.770
 versions just influenced by the fact 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.979
 that the video game makes is sold e 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.169
 in fact there are profits and col 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.120
 Minutes pass and boys tend to 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.630
 specify that I am this video 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.160
 recording practically at the same time 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.030
 to the succession of these events 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.550
 so I don't know exactly first 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.669
 what's happening right now 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.789
 while I'm recording it's pretty much 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.729
 official the fact that the three creators e 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.310
 game developers or markus 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.220
 persson we know as notch 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.530
 carle and jacob are fired from 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.430
 their role 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.750
 the site of the mojang has currently is 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.130
 offline however it should be one 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.570
 then a matter of a few minutes already 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.690
 when you are seeing this video on 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.610
 site should be again 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.750
 accessible to all with regards to 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.400
 the rest of the staff 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.260
 the wedding itself assures us that 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.050
 all the principals should remain 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.210
 developers and collaborators 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.640
 of the mojang team also in the new 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.520
 move to microsoft home 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.660
 said this guys thank you for the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.910
