wherever that may be using an inch and a
half<00:00:37.930> hex<00:00:38.680> head<00:00:38.920> screw<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:41.230> just<00:00:41.610> bring<00:00:42.610> it<00:00:42.730> up

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.880 

screw<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:53.020> I've<00:00:53.200> already<00:00:53.410> installed

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
screw it in and I've already installed

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.360 
screw it in and I've already installed
my<00:00:54.160> other<00:00:54.340> one<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:54.700> this<00:00:54.910> side<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:57.160> there's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
my other one on this side and so there's

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
my other one on this side and so there's
your<00:00:57.550> two<00:00:57.760> mounting<00:00:58.540> brackets<00:00:59.079> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:01.180> you

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
your two mounting brackets and then you

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810 
your two mounting brackets and then you
want<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.660> use<00:01:01.780> them<00:01:01.960> between<00:01:02.320> 1/2<00:01:02.680> inch<00:01:02.980> or<00:01:03.160> 3/4

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
want to use them between 1/2 inch or 3/4

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.500 
want to use them between 1/2 inch or 3/4
inch<00:01:04.059> hex<00:01:04.629> head<00:01:04.750> screws<00:01:04.899> the<00:01:05.409> smaller<00:01:05.740> ones

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
inch hex head screws the smaller ones

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
inch hex head screws the smaller ones
and<00:01:07.620> you<00:01:08.620> simply<00:01:08.860> take<00:01:09.340> your<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:10.510> valance

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and you simply take your your valance

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.680 
and you simply take your your valance
you<00:01:12.610> put<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.000> up<00:01:13.150> on<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.870> your<00:01:13.990> window<00:01:15.690> sure

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
you put it up on to your window sure

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:26.530 
you put it up on to your window sure
it's<00:01:16.840> centered

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:48.020 

and<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:28.050> at<00:01:28.500> least<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.860> screw<00:01:29.370> in<00:01:29.400> each

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.750 

and<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:50.160> as<00:01:50.340> simple<00:01:50.490> as

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
and there you have it it's as simple as

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.430 
and there you have it it's as simple as
that<00:01:50.790> actually<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> board<00:01:51.660> mounted<00:01:51.810> balance<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
that actually a board mounted balance is

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.870 
that actually a board mounted balance is
much<00:01:52.620> simpler<00:01:52.890> than<00:01:52.950> hanging<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> curtain<00:01:53.760> rod

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
much simpler than hanging a curtain rod

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
much simpler than hanging a curtain rod
so<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.830> any<00:01:55.980> questions
