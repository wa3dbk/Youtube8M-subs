90-degree turn you still want to do a
little<00:00:04.740> bit<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.069> late<00:00:05.730> apex<00:00:05.960> what's<00:00:06.960> really

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
little bit of a late apex what's really

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.680 
little bit of a late apex what's really
nice<00:00:07.919> about<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.220> turn<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.790> if<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.450> get<00:00:09.599> it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
nice about this turn is if you get it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.000 
nice about this turn is if you get it
right<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.050> lot<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.200> fun<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> drive

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
right it's a lot of fun to drive

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.539 
right it's a lot of fun to drive
it<00:00:11.490> has<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.540> nice<00:00:12.780> banking<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> has<00:00:14.309> much

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
it has a nice banking so it has much

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060 
it has a nice banking so it has much
more<00:00:14.580> grip<00:00:14.969> than<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.299> looks<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> has<00:00:16.350> so

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
more grip than it looks like it has so

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.640 
more grip than it looks like it has so
let's<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.439> calm

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
let's look at it one you in my calm

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.130 
let's look at it one you in my calm
still<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.010> third<00:00:20.189> gear<00:00:20.520> um<00:00:21.320> no<00:00:22.490> ready<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.789> my

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
still in third gear um no ready for my

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
still in third gear um no ready for my
entries<00:00:25.140> would<00:00:25.230> return<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.830> apex<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> round

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
entries would return my apex is a round

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.769 
entries would return my apex is a round
here<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> little<00:00:28.289> bit<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> braking<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
here do a little bit of braking and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
here do a little bit of braking and
through<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> nice<00:00:31.050> turnin<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> apex<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> as

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
through a nice turnin to the apex and as

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.770 
through a nice turnin to the apex and as
I<00:00:33.600> said<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:35.370> banked<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> lot

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I said it's it's banked so it has a lot

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
I said it's it's banked so it has a lot
of<00:00:36.809> grip<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.770> feel<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of grip so you can feel and actually a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.560 
of grip so you can feel and actually a
lot<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> power<00:00:39.829> come<00:00:40.829> over<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:42.270> by

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
lot of power come over here and here by

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.590 
lot of power come over here and here by
the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:43.460> starts<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.879> section<00:00:45.360> where

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the way starts the first section where

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
the way starts the first section where
you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.719> let<00:00:45.989> other<00:00:46.289> other<00:00:46.590> cars<00:00:46.950> passed

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you can let other other cars passed

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.869 
you can let other other cars passed
since<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> corkscrew<00:00:49.520> before<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> there

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
since the corkscrew before that there

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
since the corkscrew before that there
was<00:00:51.000> absolutely<00:00:51.149> no<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> let<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.410> cars

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
was absolutely no way to let a lot cars

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
was absolutely no way to let a lot cars
pass<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:54.030> wagon<00:00:54.480> from

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pass so if you have a little wagon from

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
pass so if you have a little wagon from
you<00:00:54.809> train<00:00:55.260> behind<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.739> here's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> good<00:00:56.670> point

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you train behind you here's a good point

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.270 
you train behind you here's a good point
where<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.719> let<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:58.230> cast<00:00:58.559> cars

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
where you can really let other cast cars

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
where you can really let other cast cars
pass

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.180 

okay<00:01:09.700> Abbi<00:01:10.150> coming<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.050> last<00:01:11.260> turn<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.860> our

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
okay Abbi coming to the last turn in our

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.940 
okay Abbi coming to the last turn in our
one<00:01:12.970> round<00:01:13.270> background<00:01:13.900> around<00:01:14.320> Laguna<00:01:14.710> Seca

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
one round background around Laguna Seca

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.370 
one round background around Laguna Seca
and<00:01:16.890> 2011<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.250> turn<00:01:18.520> Y<00:01:18.729> where<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.240> see<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
and 2011 is to turn Y where I see the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.850 
and 2011 is to turn Y where I see the
most

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
most

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
most
spinouts<00:01:21.900> 2011<00:01:22.900> as<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.770> easily<00:01:24.220> see<00:01:24.640> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
spinouts 2011 as you can easily see is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.290 
spinouts 2011 as you can easily see is
much<00:01:25.930> more<00:01:26.140> than<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.410> 90-degree<00:01:26.979> turn

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
much more than a 90-degree turn

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.700 
much more than a 90-degree turn
however<00:01:28.300> when<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:28.570> approach<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.080> an<00:01:29.170> 11<00:01:29.530> it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
however when you approach to an 11 it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.249 
however when you approach to an 11 it
looks<00:01:29.950> very<00:01:30.100> much<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:30.369> 90<00:01:30.850> degree<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:31.960> know

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
looks very much like 90 degree so I know

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.600 
looks very much like 90 degree so I know
I<00:01:32.290> start<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.740> sound<00:01:32.890> like<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> broken<00:01:33.340> record

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
I start to sound like a broken record

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.150 
I start to sound like a broken record
but<00:01:34.020> again<00:01:35.020> one<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.259> these<00:01:35.530> turns<00:01:35.740> where<00:01:36.040> you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
but again one of these turns where you

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.070 
but again one of these turns where you
have<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.550> force<00:01:36.850> yourself<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.540> very<00:01:37.869> late

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
have to force yourself to a very late

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.490 
have to force yourself to a very late
apex<00:01:38.580> feed<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.729> power<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.210> carefully<00:01:40.750> but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
apex feed the power and carefully but

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.139 
apex feed the power and carefully but
then<00:01:41.860> again<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.280> also<00:01:42.430> want<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.759> get<00:01:42.940> this

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
then again you also want to get this

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.950 
then again you also want to get this
turn<00:01:43.390> right<00:01:43.690> because<00:01:44.530> from<00:01:45.039> here<00:01:45.430> all<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.810> way

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
turn right because from here all the way

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.560 
turn right because from here all the way
you're<00:01:47.110> here<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.590> go<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.890> uphill<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.509> you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
you're here you go and uphill and so you

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.120 
you're here you go and uphill and so you
want<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.960> take<00:01:50.170> all<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> speed<00:01:50.710> out<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.890> this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
want to take all the speed out of this

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.510 
want to take all the speed out of this
turn<00:01:51.399> as<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.640> can<00:01:51.820> take<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.800> my<00:01:56.950> car<00:01:57.220> I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
turn as you can take so in my car I

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.279 
turn as you can take so in my car I
definitely<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.450> downshift<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.899> second

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
definitely have to downshift to second

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.990 
definitely have to downshift to second
gear<00:01:59.440> here<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:00.190> don't<00:02:00.369> share<00:02:00.610> somewhere

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
gear here so I don't share somewhere

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.870 
gear here so I don't share somewhere
here<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.660> all<00:02:01.840> my<00:02:01.990> braking<00:02:02.410> here<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.550> apex

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
here to all my braking here and the apex
