00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
connection cable let's have a look at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:44.450 
connection cable let's have a look at
the<00:01:19.220> graphics<00:01:19.490> card<00:01:19.940> itself

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.140 

and<00:01:45.460> here<00:01:45.939> it<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.240> this<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.170> EVGA<00:01:48.150> GeForce

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.880 
GTX 295 plus it's in a matte black
finish<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.490> very<00:01:54.820> tinny<00:01:55.180> case<00:01:55.570> unlike<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
finish it's a very tinny case unlike the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.120 
finish it's a very tinny case unlike the

exposed<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.340> card<00:02:04.440> there's<00:02:05.440> our<00:02:05.560> SLI

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
exposed on this card there's our SLI

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.350 
exposed on this card there's our SLI
connector<00:02:06.789> right<00:02:06.970> here<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.759> let's<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.270> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
connector right here so let's have a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.760 
connector right here so let's have a
look<00:02:10.539> at<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> particular<00:02:10.959> card<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.650> more

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
look at this particular card in more

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.130 
look at this particular card in more
detail<00:02:12.100> we're<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.480> bolt<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.690> into<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
detail we're going to bolt this into the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.780 
detail we're going to bolt this into the
computer<00:02:14.590> running<00:02:15.190> through<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> couple<00:02:15.640> of

computer running through a couple of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.509 
computer running through a couple of
benchmark<00:02:16.269> tests<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> see<00:02:17.590> exactly<00:02:17.680> how<00:02:18.250> this

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
benchmark tests and see exactly how this

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.030 
benchmark tests and see exactly how this
new<00:02:18.940> graphics<00:02:19.600> card<00:02:19.690> performs<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.739> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
new graphics card performs and the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.530 
new graphics card performs and the
benchmark<00:02:21.489> conditions

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.620 

let's<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> closer<00:02:28.960> look<00:02:29.230> at<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.650> gtx<00:02:30.130> 295

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
let's have a closer look at the gtx 295

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.630 
let's have a closer look at the gtx 295
here<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.930> our<00:02:31.990> six<00:02:32.410> pen<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.890> eight<00:02:33.370> pin

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
here we have our six pen and eight pin

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.940 
here we have our six pen and eight pin
power<00:02:33.880> connection<00:02:34.540> our<00:02:34.900> SPD<00:02:35.500> audio

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
power connection our SPD audio

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.220 
power connection our SPD audio
connection<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.020> biggest

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
connection and one of the biggest

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
connection and one of the biggest
heatsink<00:02:38.890> bands<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.370> ever<00:02:39.550> seen<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.420> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
heatsink bands have ever seen on a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.979 
heatsink bands have ever seen on a
graphics<00:02:41.110> card

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.080 

finally<00:02:44.989> here's<00:02:45.290> our<00:02:45.440> SLI<00:02:46.250> connection<00:02:46.819> point

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
finally here's our SLI connection point

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.509 
finally here's our SLI connection point
so<00:02:48.019> let's<00:02:48.230> turn<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:48.620> card<00:02:48.890> over<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.310> check

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
so let's turn this card over and check

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
so let's turn this card over and check
out<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> metal<00:02:50.120> case<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.660> opposite<00:02:50.959> side

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
out the metal case on the opposite side

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
out the metal case on the opposite side
of<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.410> card<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.069> immediate<00:02:52.489> thing<00:02:52.519> you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
of the card the immediate thing you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.210 
of the card the immediate thing you
notice<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.629> natural<00:02:53.900> venting<00:02:54.709> system<00:02:55.129> on

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
notice is the natural venting system on

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.680 
notice is the natural venting system on
the<00:02:55.310> top<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.760> case<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.300> leave<00:02:56.450> all<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
the top of this case to leave all the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.930 
the top of this case to leave all the
heat<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:57.019> as<00:02:57.500> well<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.340> matte<00:02:58.640> black

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
heat out as well as the matte black

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240 
heat out as well as the matte black
finish<00:02:59.000> which<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.140> similar<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:01.040> see

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
