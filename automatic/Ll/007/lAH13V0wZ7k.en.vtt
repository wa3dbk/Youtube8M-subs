00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
serious this maybe I'm you some part I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.720 
serious this maybe I'm you some part I
don't<00:02:41.550> know<00:02:41.610> where<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.600> goes<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:43.680> yes<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.580> does

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
don't know where it goes but yes it does
a<00:02:44.760> real<00:02:45.000> simulation<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> background<00:02:46.200> seal

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
a real simulation the background seal

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.880 
a real simulation the background seal
the<00:02:46.620> riots<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.150> pretty<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the riots that's a really pretty and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.750 
the riots that's a really pretty and
potential<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> could<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.400> cool<00:02:50.610> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
potential this could be really cool I

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.220 
potential this could be really cool I
might<00:02:50.970> make<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.300> own<00:02:51.330> little<00:02:51.510> city<00:02:51.780> separate

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
might make my own little city separate

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.860 
might make my own little city separate
city<00:02:52.410> for<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
city for this so this one is one of the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.680 
city for this so this one is one of the
custom<00:02:55.610> entrances<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.820> have<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.450> your

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
park so there's different entries you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.949 
park so there's different entries you
can<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.970> says<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.270> notes<00:03:00.510> below<00:03:00.600> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
can have it says in the notes below is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.590

or<00:03:03.810> something<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.860> them<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
or something and this was one of them I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.220 
or something and this was one of them I
think<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.489> think<00:03:06.390> I'll<00:03:06.450> swimming<00:03:06.750> pool<00:03:06.959> see

of<00:03:20.160> hanging<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.670> well<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.570> your

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
of hanging about as well so this is your

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900 
of hanging about as well so this is your
stereotypical<00:03:22.380> carousel<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.700> little

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
stereotypical carousel on the little

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.870 
stereotypical carousel on the little
horses<00:03:24.360> riding<00:03:25.080> along<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.860> two<00:03:26.519> tiers

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
horses riding along is that two tiers

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.030 
horses riding along is that two tiers
maybe<00:03:27.180> there's<00:03:27.450> two<00:03:27.630> floors<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.769> see<00:03:28.890> all<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
maybe there's two floors you see all the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.190 
maybe there's two floors you see all the
people<00:03:29.130> are<00:03:29.340> waiting<00:03:29.549> outside<00:03:30.200> looking

really<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.769> way<00:03:31.830> I'm<00:03:31.950> guessing<00:03:32.220> each

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
really for to the way I'm guessing each

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.880 
really for to the way I'm guessing each
ride<00:03:32.670> will<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> separate<00:03:33.860> about<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
ride will have like a separate about a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.949 
ride will have like a separate about a
money<00:03:35.130> can<00:03:35.340> make<00:03:35.370> almost<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.209> casino<00:03:36.690> so

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
money can make almost like a casino so

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.870 
money can make almost like a casino so
if<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.769> get<00:03:37.860> sara<00:03:38.100> had<00:03:38.220> people<00:03:38.519> come<00:03:38.850> through
