00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.509 

okay<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.309> few<00:00:08.550> tips<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:09.120> gluing<00:00:09.809> foam<00:00:10.519> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
okay so a few tips on gluing foam the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.180 
okay so a few tips on gluing foam the
first<00:00:11.789> thing<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.600> basically<00:00:13.260> foam

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
first thing is that basically foam

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.060 
first thing is that basically foam
reacts<00:00:14.879> quite<00:00:15.180> badly<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:16.080> superglue<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
reacts quite badly with superglue and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.380 
reacts quite badly with superglue and
all<00:00:17.610> those<00:00:17.790> super<00:00:18.060> glue<00:00:18.390> will<00:00:18.599> stick<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:20.210> if<00:00:21.210> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
all those super glue will stick it if I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.940 
all those super glue will stick it if I
give<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.599> quick<00:00:21.869> demonstration<00:00:22.110> like<00:00:22.770> this<00:00:24.950> you

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
give a quick demonstration like this you

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.740 
give a quick demonstration like this you
can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:27.739> can<00:00:28.739> stick<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.279> together

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
can see that I can stick it together

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.420 
can see that I can stick it together
what<00:00:30.750> you'll<00:00:30.930> find<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.770> you<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
what you'll find and you can see a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.860 
what you'll find and you can see a
beginning<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> happen<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:33.690> little

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
beginning to happen this these little

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
beginning to happen this these little
bubbles<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.590> coming<00:00:35.030> because<00:00:36.030> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
bubbles are coming because it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
bubbles are coming because it's
basically<00:00:36.829> dissolving<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> surface<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
basically dissolving the surface of the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
basically dissolving the surface of the
phone<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.960> put<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.380> of<00:00:40.470> an<00:00:40.560> excess

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
phone now I have put a bit of an excess

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
phone now I have put a bit of an excess
in<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.490> arguably<00:00:41.970> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> put<00:00:42.660> too<00:00:42.840> little<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
in but arguably if you put too little in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.680 
in but arguably if you put too little in
then<00:00:43.740> it<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.040> doesn't<00:00:44.220> stick<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
then it just doesn't stick at all so you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.319 
then it just doesn't stick at all so you
can<00:00:45.810> see<00:00:45.990> now<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.470> almost<00:00:46.650> boiling<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> if

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can see now it's almost boiling and if

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.340 
can see now it's almost boiling and if
you<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.630> touch<00:00:48.810> this<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.230> actually

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you had to touch this it's actually

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
you had to touch this it's actually
quite<00:00:49.740> hot<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.600> although<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> doing<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
quite hot so although it is doing the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.460 
quite hot so although it is doing the
job<00:00:52.380> it's<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.280> melting<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.000> foam<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.390> well

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
job it's also melting the foam as well

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.380 
job it's also melting the foam as well
so<00:00:55.470> that's<00:00:56.130> only<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.579> appropriate<00:00:56.970> when

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so that's only really appropriate when

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170 
so that's only really appropriate when
you've<00:00:57.540> got<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.260> excess<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> foam<00:00:59.250> like

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you've got a good excess of foam like

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
you've got a good excess of foam like
this<00:01:00.450> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:01.320> made<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> mistake<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.340> your

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this if you had made a mistake in your

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
this if you had made a mistake in your
model<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.060> you<00:01:03.630> want<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.079> stick<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> little

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
model and you want it to stick a little

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.490 
model and you want it to stick a little
bit<00:01:05.009> extra<00:01:05.339> wrong<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.899> would<00:01:07.020> recommend

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
bit extra wrong then I would recommend

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
bit extra wrong then I would recommend
cutting<00:01:07.829> back<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> substantial<00:01:09.000> amount<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
cutting back a substantial amount and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.440 
cutting back a substantial amount and
then<00:01:09.720> gluing<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.890> thicker<00:01:11.520> piece<00:01:11.789> say<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
then gluing on a thicker piece say of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
then gluing on a thicker piece say of
about<00:01:12.689> 10<00:01:12.990> millimetres<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.859> half<00:01:14.249> an<00:01:14.399> inch<00:01:14.990> if

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
about 10 millimetres or half an inch if

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.160 
about 10 millimetres or half an inch if
you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.319> at<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.619> manage<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.219> do<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you can at all manage to do that if you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980 
you can at all manage to do that if you
do<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:20.039> PVA<00:01:20.939> does<00:01:21.479> glue<00:01:21.719> quite

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
do have the time PVA does glue quite

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.969 
do have the time PVA does glue quite
well<00:01:22.229> although<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.729> might<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.209> get<00:01:24.389> a

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
well although you might want to get a

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.139 
well although you might want to get a
scalpel<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> key<00:01:26.999> the<00:01:27.240> surface<00:01:28.999> just<00:01:29.999> like

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
scalpel and key the surface just like

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.800 
scalpel and key the surface just like
this<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:31.499> just<00:01:31.530> means<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.249> vines<00:01:32.609> a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.659> bit

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
this it just means it vines a little bit

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.709 
this it just means it vines a little bit
better<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.060> quite<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> useful

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
better and that's quite a useful

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.489 
better and that's quite a useful
technique<00:01:36.929> enough<00:01:37.529> in<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> variety<00:01:38.429> of

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
technique enough in a variety of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.599 
technique enough in a variety of
materials<00:01:40.499> to<00:01:40.679> make<00:01:40.829> sure<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> surface<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
materials to make sure the surface is

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.819 
materials to make sure the surface is
rough<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.240> wanting<00:01:42.569> to<00:01:42.630> things<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
rough if you're wanting to things to to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
rough if you're wanting to things to to
glue<00:01:44.039> together<00:01:44.389> however<00:01:45.389> the<00:01:45.689> final<00:01:45.899> thing<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
glue together however the final thing to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
glue together however the final thing to
say<00:01:46.499> is<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.950> after<00:01:47.219> quite<00:01:47.609> a<00:01:47.639> bit<00:01:47.819> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
say is that after quite a bit of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.999 
say is that after quite a bit of
research<00:01:48.270> there's<00:01:48.779> actually<00:01:49.200> someone<00:01:49.740> who's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
research there's actually someone who's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.019 
research there's actually someone who's
developed<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:51.049> foam<00:01:52.049> -<00:01:52.349> foam<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.880> also

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
developed a foam - foam but also

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.859 
developed a foam - foam but also
suitable<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.139> wood<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.499> plastic<00:01:56.159> glue<00:01:56.459> and

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
suitable for wood and plastic glue and

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.359 
suitable for wood and plastic glue and
this<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> particularly<00:01:58.349> good<00:01:58.499> in<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.219> it's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
this is particularly good in that it's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.779 
this is particularly good in that it's
essentially<00:01:59.909> what's<00:02:00.179> called<00:02:00.359> high<00:02:00.420> tack<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
essentially what's called high tack and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.099 
essentially what's called high tack and
it<00:02:02.789> doesn't<00:02:03.179> have<00:02:03.389> the<00:02:03.539> same<00:02:03.719> sort<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
it doesn't have the same sort of

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.289 
it doesn't have the same sort of
aggressive<00:02:04.619> solvent<00:02:05.310> nature<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> doesn't

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
aggressive solvent nature so it doesn't

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.870 
aggressive solvent nature so it doesn't
burn<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.749> the<00:02:07.020> foam<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.640> get

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
burn into the foam so if you can get

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.070 
burn into the foam so if you can get
hold<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.599> doing<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:10.050> of

hold of this if you're doing a lot of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.449 
hold of this if you're doing a lot of
fun<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.890> particularly<00:02:11.280> useful

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
fun then it's particularly useful

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.400 
fun then it's particularly useful
although<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.510> does<00:02:12.660> take<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.200> while<00:02:13.380> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
although it does take a little while to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.550 
although it does take a little while to
dry<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.360> admit<00:02:15.629> though<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.079> do<00:02:16.140> tend<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
dry I have to admit though I do tend to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
dry I have to admit though I do tend to
use<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> lot<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> superglue<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.760> just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
use a lot of superglue and just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.809 
use a lot of superglue and just
essentially<00:02:18.569> use<00:02:19.049> a

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
essentially use a

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.619 
essentially use a
to<00:02:19.969> beta<00:02:20.209> which<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.629> an<00:02:20.870> accelerator<00:02:21.469> which

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
to beta which is an accelerator which

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.129 
to beta which is an accelerator which
impedes<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:24.249> dissolving<00:02:25.249> into<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:26.139> although

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:27.139 
impedes the dissolving into it although

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.259 
impedes the dissolving into it although
obviously<00:02:27.319> does<00:02:28.189> that<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.639> it<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:29.030> quite<00:02:29.239> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
obviously does that is it is quite a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.479 
obviously does that is it is quite a
toxic<00:02:29.930> chemical<00:02:30.109> so<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.799> be<00:02:31.159> used<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.459> a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
toxic chemical so to be used in a

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.660 
toxic chemical so to be used in a
well-ventilated<00:02:31.849> area<00:02:32.659> so<00:02:33.469> there<00:02:34.189> we<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.310> hope

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
well-ventilated area so there we go hope

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030 
well-ventilated area so there we go hope
that's<00:02:34.879> useful
