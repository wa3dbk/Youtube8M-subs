00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
what I was doing is I was actually using

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.520 
what I was doing is I was actually using
a<00:00:34.620> tungsten<00:00:35.270> worm<00:00:36.270> weight<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
a tungsten worm weight and I had a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
a tungsten worm weight and I had a
little<00:00:37.739> glass<00:00:37.950> bead<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.460> shaking<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
little glass bead on there shaking it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.639 
little glass bead on there shaking it
and<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.300> made<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.570> unique<00:00:40.020> sound<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and it made a really unique sound and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.799 
and it made a really unique sound and
that's<00:00:40.770> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> concept<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.750> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
that's kind of the concept of this and I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.630 
that's kind of the concept of this and I
got<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> thinking<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.520> have

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
got to thinking about what would have

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
got to thinking about what would have
what<00:00:45.120> sound<00:00:45.420> would<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> make<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
what sound would it make when it that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
what sound would it make when it that
blade<00:00:47.520> comes<00:00:47.879> around<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> knocks<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
blade comes around and knocks that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
blade comes around and knocks that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.050 
pretty much done another way that I that
we<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.630> figured<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> fish<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> bait

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
we kind of figured out to fish this bait

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
we kind of figured out to fish this bait
if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> knock<00:01:43.100> take<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
if you don't want it to knock take a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.310 
if you don't want it to knock take a
pair<00:01:44.479> excuse<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> pair<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> needlenose

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
pair excuse me a pair of needlenose

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
pair excuse me a pair of needlenose
pliers<00:01:47.930> print<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> Delta<00:01:49.560> ribbit<00:01:50.030> just<00:01:51.030> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
pliers print that Delta ribbit just like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.280 
pliers print that Delta ribbit just like
right<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> bin<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> doesn't<00:01:53.549> move

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
right on the bin so it doesn't move

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
right on the bin so it doesn't move
right<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
right there and then what you do is you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
right there and then what you do is you
take<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.719> sandpaper<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> sand<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
take some sandpaper and you sand that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.270 
take some sandpaper and you sand that
edge<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.149> well<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> edge<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
edge as well as that edge then when is

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
edge as well as that edge then when is
spinning<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.360> here's<00:02:03.840> another<00:02:03.960> little<00:02:04.259> tip

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
spinning and here's another little tip

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.700 
spinning and here's another little tip
to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.149> once<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.299> sand<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.409> crimp

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to do that once you sand it you crimp

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
to do that once you sand it you crimp
that<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> hair<00:02:08.670> blow<00:02:08.849> dryer<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.479> go

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that you take a hair blow dryer you go

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.510 
that you take a hair blow dryer you go
down<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.140> blade<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.770> makes<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> spin<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
down on the blade and it makes it spin a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
down on the blade and it makes it spin a
thousand<00:02:12.090> times<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:12.959> actually<00:02:13.170> be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
thousand times and that will actually be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
thousand times and that will actually be
cause<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> sounded<00:02:14.430> it'll<00:02:14.790> actually<00:02:14.970> turn

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
cause you sounded it'll actually turn

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.090 
cause you sounded it'll actually turn
into<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.660> squeaker<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.770> making<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
into a squeaker so it's making a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.230 
into a squeaker so it's making a
different<00:02:17.430> sound<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.790> there's<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.060> different

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
different sound so there's two different

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.130 
different sound so there's two different
ways<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.630> fish<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.070> very<00:02:20.070> proud<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.610> bait

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
ways to fish it very proud of this bait

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.600 
ways to fish it very proud of this bait
I'm<00:02:22.140> telling<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I'm telling you right now I'm going to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.070 
I'm telling you right now I'm going to
win<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:23.970> terminus<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> fall<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
win some terminus this fall on them you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.330 
win some terminus this fall on them you
better<00:02:25.200> get<00:02:25.440> some<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> got

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.370 

ah
