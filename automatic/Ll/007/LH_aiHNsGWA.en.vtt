sure that they are not taken in a
remedial<00:03:34.180> classes<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.139> they<00:03:35.260> are<00:03:35.319> ready<00:03:35.680> to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
remedial classes but they are ready to

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.580 
remedial classes but they are ready to
go<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.280> tackle<00:03:37.090> all<00:03:37.329> those<00:03:37.510> classes<00:03:38.019> easily

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
go and tackle all those classes easily

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.319 
go and tackle all those classes easily
because<00:03:39.040> they<00:03:39.159> have<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.579> background<00:03:39.819> and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
because they have that background and

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.690 
because they have that background and
then<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.230> feel<00:03:41.439> that<00:03:41.620> yes<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.159> did<00:03:42.310> our<00:03:42.430> job

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
then we can feel that yes we did our job

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.699 
then we can feel that yes we did our job
well<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.419> they<00:03:43.599> can<00:03:43.870> graduate<00:03:44.230> within<00:03:44.560> four

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
well that they can graduate within four

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.830 
well that they can graduate within four
years<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.579> know<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.909> continue<00:03:46.720> their

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
years you know and continue their

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.690 
years you know and continue their
masters<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.379> PhD<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.189> therefore<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.609> think

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
masters and PhD so therefore I think

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.839 
masters and PhD so therefore I think
that's<00:03:49.569> what<00:03:49.750> makes<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> SAS<00:03:50.409> so<00:03:50.849> it's

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
that's what makes the SAS so it's

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.369 
that's what makes the SAS so it's
helping<00:03:52.180> me<00:03:52.299> prepare<00:03:52.450> for<00:03:52.810> college<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.290> it's

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
helping me prepare for college and it's

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.899 
helping me prepare for college and it's
like<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.650> come<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.950> school<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.430> I'm<00:03:54.879> learning

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
like I come to school and I'm learning

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.879 
like I come to school and I'm learning
but<00:03:55.389> it's<00:03:55.510> not<00:03:55.629> like<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.989> have<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.409> go<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.620> school

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
but it's not like I have to go to school

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.159
