00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
soldier and then here's my rover I have

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
soldier and then here's my rover I have
a<00:02:06.990> broken<00:02:07.439> arm<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.399> isn't<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
a broken arm right now so this isn't the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.449 
a broken arm right now so this isn't the
best<00:02:09.090> rover<00:02:09.599> I've<00:02:09.690> made<00:02:12.920> I'm<00:02:13.920> probably<00:02:14.160> going

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
best rover I've made I'm probably going

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.160 
best rover I've made I'm probably going
to<00:02:14.550> build<00:02:14.700> another<00:02:14.819> one<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.569> arm<00:02:15.780> heals

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
to build another one with my arm heals

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.430 
to build another one with my arm heals
but<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.140> best<00:02:19.350> looking

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
but here it is it's not the best looking

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.340 
but here it is it's not the best looking
over<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.370> good<00:02:20.720> enough<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> play<00:02:22.050> with

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
over but it's good enough to play with

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.770 
over but it's good enough to play with
but<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.280> looks<00:02:23.489> kind<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.569> real<00:02:24.750> one
