00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.009 
particularly important to look out for
eye<00:02:55.840> signs<00:02:56.350> such<00:02:56.650> as<00:02:56.680> optic<00:02:57.160> gliomas<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.239> it

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
eye signs such as optic gliomas and it

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.140 
eye signs such as optic gliomas and it
also<00:02:59.230> causes<00:02:59.650> short<00:03:00.100> stature<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.790> macro

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
also causes short stature and macro

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.000 
also causes short stature and macro
carefully<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:01.930> it'd<00:03:01.989> be<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.260> important<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
carefully so it'd be really important to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
carefully so it'd be really important to
monitor<00:03:03.450> growth<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:06.370> can<00:03:06.519> also<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.970> osseous

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
monitor growth they can also get osseous

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.300 
monitor growth they can also get osseous
lesions<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> full<00:03:08.739> musculoskeletal

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
lesions so a full musculoskeletal

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.699 
lesions so a full musculoskeletal
examination<00:03:10.000> will<00:03:10.510> be<00:03:10.540> helpful<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.410> I

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
examination will be helpful and I

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.990 
examination will be helpful and I
believe<00:03:12.010> these<00:03:12.220> can<00:03:12.400> sometimes<00:03:12.549> be

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
believe these can sometimes be

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.570 
believe these can sometimes be
osteosarcoma<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.500> close<00:03:14.830> monitoring<00:03:15.250> be

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
osteosarcoma so close monitoring be

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.170 
osteosarcoma so close monitoring be
essential<00:03:16.620> they<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.769> also<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.310> renal

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
essential they can also have renal

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.930 
essential they can also have renal
involvement<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.650> abdominal<00:03:23.650> examination

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
involvement so abdominal examination

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.250 
involvement so abdominal examination
monitoring<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.030> blood<00:03:25.209> pressure<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.019> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
monitoring a blood pressure and you and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.039 
monitoring a blood pressure and you and
kidney<00:03:27.190> function<00:03:27.370> would<00:03:28.180> also<00:03:28.390> be<00:03:28.630> important

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
kidney function would also be important

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.080 
kidney function would also be important
to<00:03:29.140> print<00:03:29.350> those<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.070> they<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:30.940> get

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
to print those and they can get

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.420 
to print those and they can get
scoliosis<00:03:31.570> as<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.440> mentioned<00:03:33.010> I'd<00:03:33.100> like<00:03:33.250> to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
scoliosis as I mentioned I'd like to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.490 
scoliosis as I mentioned I'd like to
examine<00:03:33.640> Sophie's<00:03:34.209> spine<00:03:37.350> anything<00:03:38.350> else

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
examine Sophie's spine anything else

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560 
examine Sophie's spine anything else
you'd<00:03:38.709> like<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:39.130> include<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.970> your<00:03:40.000> management

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
you'd like to include in your management

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.900 
you'd like to include in your management

plan and so in terms of the management
of<00:03:43.000> neurofibromatosis<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:44.080> really

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
of neurofibromatosis it's really

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.930 
of neurofibromatosis it's really
important<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.890> take<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> multidisciplinary
