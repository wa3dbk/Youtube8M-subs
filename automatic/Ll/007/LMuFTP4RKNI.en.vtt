00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
system here put in and I put this in

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.900 
system here put in and I put this in
maybe<00:00:17.199> two<00:00:17.410> years<00:00:17.439> ago<00:00:17.740> now<00:00:17.860> some<00:00:18.610> like<00:00:18.759> that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
maybe two years ago now some like that

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.189 
maybe two years ago now some like that
have<00:00:19.689> 275<00:00:20.439> gallons<00:00:20.980> here<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:22.079> really<00:00:23.079> been

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
have 275 gallons here I really been

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.140 
have 275 gallons here I really been
saying<00:00:23.439> since<00:00:23.619> about<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.520> first<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.910> year<00:00:25.119> i

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
saying since about the first a year i

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.060 
saying since about the first a year i
guess<00:00:25.449> that<00:00:25.960> i<00:00:26.020> want<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.349> put<00:00:26.410> a<00:00:26.469> second<00:00:26.919> tank

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
guess that i want to put a second tank

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.420 
guess that i want to put a second tank
in<00:00:27.340> so<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:27.939> would<00:00:28.059> give<00:00:28.090> me<00:00:28.239> lower<00:00:29.020> 5<00:00:29.430> 500

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
in so that would give me lower 5 500

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.119 
in so that would give me lower 5 500
gallons<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:30.969> water<00:00:31.960> stored<00:00:32.500> up<00:00:32.680> plus<00:00:32.980> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
that in with any rain catchment system

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.270 
that in with any rain catchment system
I've<00:01:04.899> already<00:01:05.049> cleaned<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.500> out<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:06.009> couple

we<00:01:33.520> could<00:01:33.670> use<00:01:33.819> the<00:01:33.969> filter<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.450> if<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.869> had

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
we could use the filter this if we had

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.889 
we could use the filter this if we had
to<00:01:35.289> if<00:01:35.590> our<00:01:35.920> water<00:01:36.130> system<00:01:36.490> went<00:01:36.639> down<00:01:36.700> but<00:01:37.630> i

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
to if our water system went down but i

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.230 
to if our water system went down but i
recently<00:01:38.349> bought<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:39.009> larger<00:01:39.609> filter<00:01:39.880> system

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
recently bought a larger filter system

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
to show this on my camera this is a top

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:04.379 
to show this on my camera this is a top
piece<00:01:57.819> here<00:01:59.579> has<00:02:00.579> two<00:02:00.819> filters<00:02:02.999> you<00:02:03.999> fill<00:02:04.240> it

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:04.389 
piece here has two filters you fill it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.209 
piece here has two filters you fill it
up<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.779> the<00:02:04.990> top<00:02:05.259> with<00:02:05.619> your<00:02:05.799> water<00:02:06.009> that

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
up to the top with your water that

understand<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.009> actually<00:02:09.280> primes<00:02:09.640> easier<00:02:10.209> if

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
understand it actually primes easier if

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.400 
understand it actually primes easier if

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
something you can just pour the water in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.720 
something you can just pour the water in
there<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.500> all<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.190> sudden<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.460> got<00:02:27.550> some

there and all of a sudden you got some
drinking<00:02:28.060> water<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.690> little<00:02:28.840> slow<00:02:29.140> but

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
drinking water so it's a little slow but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.350 
drinking water so it's a little slow but
it'll<00:02:30.190> filter<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> water<00:02:30.550> drips<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.150> into

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it'll filter the water drips out into

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.450 
it'll filter the water drips out into
here<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:33.670> strips<00:02:34.000> into<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.570> container

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
here which strips into this container

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.920 
here which strips into this container
the<00:02:36.460> house<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.760> spout<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.690> makes<00:02:37.810> it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the house the spout on it so it makes it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.140 
the house the spout on it so it makes it
really<00:02:38.050> easy<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.350> get<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> water<00:02:38.710> out<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.220> this

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
really easy to get the water out so this

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.360 
really easy to get the water out so this
sets<00:02:40.420> down<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:44.200> hear<00:02:44.440> what's<00:02:45.190> set

be<00:03:44.530> able<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.769> drink<00:03:44.950> water<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.459> you're<00:03:46.090> gonna

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
be able to drink water or you're gonna

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.449 
be able to drink water or you're gonna
get<00:03:46.330> dehydrated<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.830> were<00:03:47.950> going<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.280> die

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
get dehydrated and you were going to die

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.400 
get dehydrated and you were going to die
eventually<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.480> can<00:03:49.630> live<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> few<00:03:50.230> days

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
eventually you can live a few days

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.070 
eventually you can live a few days
without<00:03:51.070> water<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:51.820> you're<00:03:52.750> gonna<00:03:52.900> die

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
without water but you're gonna die

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.240 
without water but you're gonna die
eventually<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.680> you've<00:03:53.830> got<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.100> build<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
eventually so you've got to build a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.530 
eventually so you've got to build a
drink<00:03:54.459> water<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:54.970> moment<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.330> start

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.080 
drink water in the moment you start
drinking<00:03:55.660> water<00:03:55.989> out<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.470> streams<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.910> can

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
drinking water out of the streams it can

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.880 
drinking water out of the streams it can
be<00:03:58.180> contaminated<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.930> don't<00:03:59.110> realize<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.739> and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
be contaminated you don't realize it and

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.020 
be contaminated you don't realize it and
you're<00:03:59.950> gonna<00:04:00.100> get<00:04:00.250> sick<00:04:00.489> gonna<00:04:00.820> start

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
you're gonna get sick gonna start

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.420 
you're gonna get sick gonna start
vomiting<00:04:01.209> gonna<00:04:01.750> have<00:04:01.870> diarrhea<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.310> you're

vomiting gonna have diarrhea so you're

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.009 
vomiting gonna have diarrhea so you're
gonna<00:04:03.519> get<00:04:03.700> even<00:04:03.940> more<00:04:04.090> sick<00:04:04.390> because<00:04:04.810> you

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
gonna get even more sick because you

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.060 
gonna get even more sick because you
drank<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.320> water<00:04:05.440> you're<00:04:05.769> getting<00:04:05.950> more

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
drank the water you're getting more

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.850 
drank the water you're getting more
dehydrated<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:08.080> be<00:04:08.260> able<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.470> filter<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
dehydrated so you be able to filter the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.190 
dehydrated so you be able to filter the
water<00:04:08.890> now<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:09.940> obviously<00:04:10.420> isn't<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.810> system

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
water now this obviously isn't a system

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.140 
water now this obviously isn't a system
that<00:04:11.320> could<00:04:11.440> go<00:04:11.620> into<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.920> bug-out<00:04:12.280> bag<00:04:12.519> which

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that could go into a bug-out bag which

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.720 
that could go into a bug-out bag which
is<00:04:13.180> why<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.570> have<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.780> birch<00:04:13.989> e.o<00:04:14.730> sports
