00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.710
 new video as they saw it in the title 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.450
 new department confirmed and here it 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.700
 I bring them I did not just look for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 as crazy looking for the location and at the end 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.420
 I have found her as they are seeing 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.010
 right here we are going to take our 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.630
 phone I do not know what I put on the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.369
 little town to see let's get here 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 so that you can appreciate what 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 better not going to see that I go up again and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 already with that you could already catch you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 all this then let's go up here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 to this location and right now to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.940
 then I'm going to take out the phone and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.739
 you can see this new department no 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 that this department now I'm going to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 say what it is and how all this is going to go 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 then first let me put myself in the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 Orillita took the phone to see phone 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 taken out and look, we are going to put them like this and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 just look to see'll see how 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.690
 It accommodated just arribita thus better for 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 that they see everything they are going to see the image of the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 new department that was just 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 confirm in the web news you already know that the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 news web is the social network that has the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 rock star game in which they warn us 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 before any place there is where 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.650
 they publish their new games that are going to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 get out of leces or anything that gets 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.290
 happen to them either 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.300
 a new mission capture 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 confirmed some draw they want 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.230
 do that's where they post it and how 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 come is a department which we 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.250
 we can buy and as you can see it is the same 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.410
 in fact if they are anne if they notice the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 perspective love to write down that it's right in 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.340
 front of the town hall where there is with 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 a little square and the truth that this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 department promises pretty not maybe 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
 be the same as the previous ones but you can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 make it more luxurious and take in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.290
 mind I tell you one thing put on 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 make the clichÃ©s of money because the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.980
 may it cost twice as much 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 money can a department not 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.120
 come out at 1,800,000 because as they are from 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.160
 more luxury or we will be able to have 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.050
 timeshare may cost a lot 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.320
 more so I tell them to go for a 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.330
 time 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.980
 saving him and I what I think is that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.110
 it's practically going to be this department 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.700
 but revolutionized because a lot of people 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 what do you have in this department then 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.600
 let me down from here for you 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.040
 then see, in fact, I'm going to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.680
 leave the location where is the new 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.530
 department and I base myself on all this 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.030
 well practically seeing the perspective 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 also that in the other department they go 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.660
 to draw as the evolution of richard 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 majestic and the truth that is something that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.060
 it would be pretty good then let me 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.790
 I go down 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.650
 and right now they're going to see all this not me 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.569
 It came down to see the helicopter not fail me 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.300
 who does not drive then look 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.550
 this is the practically the department 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.110
 many will know some not and as 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.060
 come here I'm in the apartment 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.950
 sorry yes and very rough handling the bus 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.840
 ar but I do practically to go 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.910
 faster then let's go down and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.590
 look here as you see it is the new 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.660
 department I do not know if the one that goes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.959
 sell the new apartments go to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.319
 be 18 but as you see it costs 270 thousand and 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.330
 286 thousand ok then here may it be 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.370
 the new department is in fact 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.440
 confirmed because it is the new image that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 they pulled out then it will be something to wait for what 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 let us be told by the people of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.650
 rockstar and wait for him to come out is 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.049
 already in fact the day that the dlc comes out 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.459
 it will be something to see, it can not be a 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.480
 simple new perspective that you have 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 put eye can be a new 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.230
 no department that is possible 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.730
 which are new departments because 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.590
 they confirmed that they are going to add more 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 so that's why today's video is not 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.739
 forget you like favorites subscribe to 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.120
 channel if they are not subscribed in the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.400
 description I will leave my twitter for 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.780
 that they can follow me and out there any 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 what they want to tell me 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 You can say it is much more comfortable than 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.780
 tell me anything by twitter 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
 by twitter it is much easier to tell them 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.799
 any news that by means of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.780
 youtube since on youtube you have to 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.370
 upload the video if I have internet very 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.829
 bad and I do not take long to climb 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.829
 no more to say I say goodbye goodbye 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.090
 and
