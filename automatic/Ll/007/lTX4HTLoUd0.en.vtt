00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.279
 hello dear friends yourself sergey 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 EZovsky videobloger flight from Spain 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.079
 at least read you a letter 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.749
 to such questions 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.599
 I often have to answer 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.849
 put on letters and i decided 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.809
 filmed this video to answer at once 

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.550
 many people many customers many videos 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.929
 First let's read the viewer 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.599
 letters these measures are transmitted by tert.am 5 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.719
 real rental fee 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.990
 apartments for example 50 thousand euros 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 rent depends and instead 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.740
 apartment purchases 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.810
 if this city is alicante where i am 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.560
 live 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.440
 this implies an estimated 250 300 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410
 euro year-round see 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.920
 if it is a common area it is possible 400 500 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.170
 even 600 euros 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 under the month 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.080
 pull out rent there are similar budget and 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.160
 apartments unlikely 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.780
 for this apartment must be 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.190
 on the first second third line of the sea 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.050
 such a case 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.040
 rent can be 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 up to five hundred euros per week 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 but this is no longer fifty 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.990
 thousand euros is 120 thousand euros and above 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.720
 she low budget options 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.630
 expect to get good 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.590
 rent 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.820
 is impossible 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.960
 if we take 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 villa townhouse 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.120
 and who is on vacation even dollars 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.890
 kilometers 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.290
 distance from the sea it may be 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.590
 for example and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.090
 500 euros per week 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.250
 and we will decide significantly therefore 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.830
 low budget options for 50 thousand 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.870
 you need to average the number of getting the plan 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.040
 rent payment 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 from but to Beijing court with the euro 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670
 it's season 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.240
 four hundred five hundred euros a month per season 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.689
 the season starts here 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.329
 in May and ends in September approximately 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539
 so that is about six months but 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.159
 you need to count that he 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.360
 very active 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.780
 it is somewhere here its reception ubs 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.400
 that is, three months is very active when 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 you can give out quite expensive 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.200
 own property 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 it is necessary to understand Alexander is the capital 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.429
 one option 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.759
 such as the house thief other cards 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:13.729
 another variant 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.899
 that is, you need to decide for 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.209
 start at least 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.119
 purchase an apartment together 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.859
 can be done through consultation 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.349
 by skype he's on the phone 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.690
 it's very hard for me to answer every time 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.740
 the same thing is ok so i wrote down 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.950
 this one let's see the next question 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.879
 are spanish banks worth mortgages yes give 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.889
 of course they give 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.019
 especially Russians, and this everyone knows 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.889
 see the list of basic documents 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.449
 which are necessary for obtaining a mortgage 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.819
 Further 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.739
 the decision on the mortgage takes the bar 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.199
 and nobody else 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.129
 and therefore will give you for fun or not this 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.030
 will be known 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.390
 after the bank looks all these 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.049
 regions documents in spanish 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:58.999
 hopefully 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.099
 answered this question too 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.989
 how does the market feel? 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.090
 rent there is also a deep hole 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.290
 rental market 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.890
 I tried to explain at the beginning but now 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.439
 laid out feel 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.729
 sumptuously 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.619
 and now you will not find the villa 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.309
 on the seafront let's say the cost 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.849
 for three thousand euros they are all 1 dollar 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.450
 per month in Yemen for 1000 euros per week such 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.510
 There are options for the account 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.400
 if we say oh how-called army then 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200
 so the real estate market is far 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.409
 remote from zero 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.619
 also lived workers these areas 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.619
 there are many empty apartments 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.569
 you will try these workers 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.849
 create your apartment 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.220
 they are out of work 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.130
 30 percent spanish population 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.659
 sitting without work 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.999
 well, Russian-working Russian 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.169
 who live here they are building 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.759
 objects in Sochi 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.439
 for the olympiad they all went away need it 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.829
 implies need to understand this 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.269
 the cheaper budget option 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.609
 less chance and pay back the wig further 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.680
 show any surrender services 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.339
 rental housing yes of course rendered and 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.719
 above each video 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.739
 moron 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.869
 constantly my advertisement 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:10.710
 by the way 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.720
 in rental real estate sales and so on and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.969
 so on execution of all documents 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.879
 namely the search for tenants so 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.689
 of course how they are treated very 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.389
 many people 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.909
 asking for a bruise apartment villa 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.059
 got caught and so on 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.059
 so 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.179
 I hope that I am more or less transparent 

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:34.249
 answered this question 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.329
 plus you need to understand in advance that we are 

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:39.159
 have to pay with this money 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.050
 to the person who was killed by this 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.009
 engage 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.539
 rental control and so on and 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.840
 etc 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.860
 publisher 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.050
 you must take away 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.440
 certain amount year 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.860
 crazy comes from 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.030
 their personal agreement with 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.750
 your agent or firms
