00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
ball of it rest on the triangular part

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.540 
ball of it rest on the triangular part
of<00:01:36.280> your<00:01:36.399> bicep<00:01:36.820> conform<00:01:37.149> myself<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.280> is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
of your bicep conform myself so this is

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.910 
of your bicep conform myself so this is
a<00:01:39.640> rack<00:01:39.850> position<00:01:40.060> hold<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.780> like<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:40.960> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
a rack position hold it like this the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400 
a rack position hold it like this the
other<00:01:41.950> kettlebell<00:01:42.729> will<00:01:43.030> simply<00:01:43.330> be<00:01:43.479> expended

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
other kettlebell will simply be expended

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.480 
other kettlebell will simply be expended
overhead

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
overhead

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.670 
overhead
so<00:01:45.850> one<00:01:46.060> kettlebell<00:01:46.270> wrapped<00:01:46.780> one<00:01:47.440> kettlebell

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
so one kettlebell wrapped one kettlebell

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.200 
so one kettlebell wrapped one kettlebell
overhead<00:01:48.340> that's<00:01:48.729> business

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
overhead that's business

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.810 
overhead that's business
my<00:01:49.660> idea<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.410> go<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:51.070> can<00:01:51.250> develop<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
my idea is to go that can develop in the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.150 
my idea is to go that can develop in the
rack<00:01:52.000> position<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.619> overhead

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
rack position and in the overhead

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.700 
rack position and in the overhead
position<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:55.090> SWAT<00:01:55.600> down<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.200> about<00:01:56.440> parallel

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
position and SWAT down to about parallel

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.070 
position and SWAT down to about parallel
to<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.130> floor<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.700> not<00:01:57.970> nor<00:01:58.179> what<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.630> and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
to the floor if not nor what you can and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.440 
to the floor if not nor what you can and
then<00:01:59.320> come<00:01:59.350> back<00:01:59.530> up<00:01:59.920> trying<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.850> stay<00:02:01.030> more<00:02:01.330> or

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
then come back up trying to stay more or

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.490 
then come back up trying to stay more or
less<00:02:01.570> upright<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.679> do<00:02:02.830> this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.500 

you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.850 

when<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.569> do<00:02:18.720> them<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.200> toughest<00:02:19.620> part<00:02:19.830> about

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
when you do them the toughest part about

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.140 
when you do them the toughest part about
that<00:02:20.129> whole<00:02:20.280> thing<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.549> gonna<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.760> trying<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
that whole thing is gonna be trying to

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.330 
that whole thing is gonna be trying to
keep<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> kettlebell<00:02:21.900> over<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.950> shoulder

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
keep that kettlebell over your shoulder

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
ideally the caterpillar ball or the way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.960 
ideally the caterpillar ball or the way
to<00:02:27.599> tell<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> should<00:02:28.349> rest<00:02:28.680> directly<00:02:29.430> above

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
to tell that should rest directly above

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.660 
to tell that should rest directly above
your<00:02:30.090> shoulder<00:02:30.450> complex<00:02:30.659> itself<00:02:31.459> put<00:02:32.459> aside

your shoulder complex itself put aside

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.050 
your shoulder complex itself put aside

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.430 

keeping<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.750> credibility<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.349> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
keeping that credibility in that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930 
keeping that credibility in that
position<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.950> help<00:02:44.160> keep<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.400> stable<00:02:44.790> while
