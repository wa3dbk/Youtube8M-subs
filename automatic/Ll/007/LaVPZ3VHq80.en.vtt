00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 movie as it always sounds one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.549
 somewhat cynical but the world is in 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.309
 Fire in a manner of speaking is 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 get up now 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.469
 maria the investors who seem that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 to ignore it completely 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.840
 currently 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.389
 yes indeed he you indeed see what 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.369
 some things and russia ukraine is allowed anyway 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.990
 something clear on problems is something 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.910
 less for us but more for the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.050
 Russian economy of course itself 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.119
 you clearly have problems in it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.070
 Northern Iraq have a lower risk with the oil 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 Supply now think so too 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 will not walk that far because it is that long 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.160
 of course not allowed in that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 hit south those two and half remain 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760
 million barrels 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 flow a day you finally have it 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.210
 gaza also mega unfortunately that is too 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 nothing new so you could say there 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 are many fires but none 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.390
 only a source of fire is currently large 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 enough to really have that global economy and that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.309
 world stock markets now as 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 you look at the s &amp; p 500 yes that's that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.680
 a little bit frightening 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.149
 in the sense that you have been since January 2013 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 at the bottom forty-five degree angle 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.070
 rises without volatility and that it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.660
 actually already 31 months ago that we 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.920
 another significant correction 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.869
 yes yes that is maybe anyway 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 quite a bit to worry about 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.119
 to make 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.159
 they not only the large shares also the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.869
 smaller shares have risen sharply 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
 but i have the impression when i go to the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 russel index look that there by a certain 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 go stabilization there are some of them 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 act becomes indicators where we do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.680
 be careful by first and foremost 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.540
 especially of course the technical margins 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 bought over by noting for example 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.659
 many shares above and 200 days 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.310
 average and so on and so on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.600
 but ultimately the most important date anyone 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.400
 there's a kind of your thousand where you go anyway 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 sees it with a bit of a top formation 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.600
 They make you and you end up 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.579
 yet also the long macd begins to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 and what he often sees is that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.820
 first smaller values ​​begin 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 and then be on the market 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.490
 so it gets a bit harder 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.829
 this is clearly one 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 warning sign investors 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 ignore the geopolitical situation 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 what we do is very vigilant 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
 look at the central bank of the ecb 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.219
 We know that interest will continue for a very long time 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.659
 keep it low 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.329
 the further there is perhaps one 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.799
 other story there are actually three 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.969
 main reasons why on something 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.469
 still positive in the longer term 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.090
 remain for the stock markets 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.340
 on the one hand it is also there 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 global economy europe is not growing fast 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.600
 but amera's is pretty strong and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.490
 China is also seeing improvement 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.200
 results season that we have is more 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.850
 then pretty good the prospects 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.710
 have been adjusted downwards somewhat 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.300
 in advance thus the companies make it 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.770
 red is easy but we can too 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.510
 not saying that it is really bad and 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.670
 the third element the most important thing 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
 element an element that is also very common 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 pushed forward the central banks 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 the quality in the system remains expensive 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.930
 and there is perhaps the risk where the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.210
 last we talked we got it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
 talked about if there is a risk it is right 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.630
 had that american economy 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.520
 rapid growth than expected and that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.650
 furthermore it would be mandatory to get that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.150
 interest rates are going to increase faster if 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.320
 you then go to these graph eggs 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.390
 pretty interesting 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.050
 the red line there you see the potential 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.820
 growth of the economy from 97 to 2007 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.200
 but then you also see the blue line 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.640
 and there you finally see that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 maybe that potential 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.970
 is a bit less than we think and 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.190
 then it 's about the so-called 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.390
 participation drove the population 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.560
 aging matters less and less 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.450
 americans 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 in the labor process ultimately 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.050
 if you then it's the real one 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.880
 gpp growth sees yes then it is 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.650
 relatively short perhaps with that new 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.390
 potential if you compare it with so 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.220
 the old potential is quite a bit 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.930
 I mean he still has economies 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.540
 a whole time can grow further without 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 create inflation as of course that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.320
 potential is lower than the rest itself 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.240
 think or say think 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.590
 Yes, unemployment would be even faster 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.480
 come down and there might be a bit 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.490
 pressure on wages could come there 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.160
 inflation could come and so actually the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.960
 Bold be required to speed up the interest 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.610
 raise them to high risk 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.740
 to know from experience that at the moment 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.000
 that's the short side of the american 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.720
 kermen is moving because there we have it 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.520
 then about 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.920
 again often sees volatility in the other 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.510
 markets they summarize long term 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.790
 guess the story is still intact 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.170
 is but in the short term it did 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.730
 clear indications to say 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.680
 maybe the sold is short term 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.940
 Investors aren't really stupid to be here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.940
 to pick up a little money off the table
