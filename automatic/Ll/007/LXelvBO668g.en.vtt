00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 I hide behind this door 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.900
 i am diana for all who still love me 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.240
 do not know and yes today I have 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.030
 I'll tell you something 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.690
 even I manage with two left 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 hands as far as cook and bake 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 Christmas is known for that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.529
 you calories without end in itself 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.740
 throws cookies like for example 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 marzipan potatoes gingerbread speculum 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 and so on and I thought so 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.510
 I'll show you a variant so 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 you do not have to have several for that now 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 hours in the kitchen 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.680
 and yes that's a Russian 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 Dessert and its name is actually 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.710
 branche has oskar and is called free 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 translated something like that of the potato 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.320
 and that's what it looks like and potato 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 because it's so brown on the outside 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 is inside and in when cutting that on 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.030
 it's just so creamy yellowish 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.100
 like a real potato, so to speak 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 and the taste is similar 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 I do not know if you can do it now 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.270
 in the south knows but grenade splitter to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 There is an example here in Germany 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 stay with the baker and yes something like that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.250
 it tastes that way and if you are 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.409
 want to know how you place this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 but not so far these potatoes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.079
 how he can imitate the remains 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.420
 Also easy on it so you need 100 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.670
 butter is best 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 room temperature and let stand in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.610
 cut small pieces with them 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 becomes soft 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.260
 then you need a dose of kues like 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.210
 you can find in a Russian shop 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.730
 So that's just sugared 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.410
 condensed milk and yes I have now 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.100
 here in this glass transfilled 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.110
 then you need 300 grams of rusk and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.760
 cover or cocoa so depending how cute 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.370
 you want to have yesterday so I take 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.160
 always dear body then you need 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.790
 two more tablespoons of red wine and later 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.560
 also some milk and another egg 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.600
 also needs a big plate for 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.820
 serve a glass bowl and a 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.910
 small flat plate on the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.830
 Platter pours something came first 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 rather small animals the rickety and that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.660
 until it is really small crumbs 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.630
 and those crumbs will come then 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.920
 along with the butter in the bowl 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.989
 Now you blur that with the first 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.580
 hand so with the mixer it is unfortunately 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.209
 not because otherwise it is really quite 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.820
 dusty affair will come after 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.370
 nor that the red wine and the sugared 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.640
 condensed milk and now mixed 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.200
 you all very well 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 yes and now you have to look like 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.380
 So the end of you looks like that 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 for me now is definitely too tight 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.890
 then sense if the rusk then after 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 one time the whole humidity 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.790
 then the dessert absorbs easily 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.400
 not so good because it's just too dry 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.790
 That's why you will find some milk 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.519
 on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.000
 just look that it does not end up like this 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.830
 is fixed but rather a mushy one 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.250
 has consistency and then the dessert 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.310
 later perfect yes and now from the animal 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.290
 this area so small balls and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.269
 then you roll that ball in the cover 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.610
 and then place it on the serving plate 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.500
 I always start with very small ones 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.760
 balls, and at some point I have to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.160
 no more desire because it is so long 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.800
 these potatoes always take and become 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.360
 bigger and bigger but for you i have 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.690
 I really do a lot of trouble now 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.370
 given and so they look finished and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.700
 but have to first my fridge 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.050
 Now the potatoes were over night 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.910
 outside so we had today 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.150
 Minus temperatures therefore that went 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.130
 otherwise yes she does her fridge 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 So after two to three hours you can 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.700
 who then eat then it is 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.530
 potato then become so firm and then 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.150
 you can also really bite and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:03.420
 so on and yes, then a little more 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.070
 Note from me just because of what is there 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.310
 inside is definitely within 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.170
 three days at the most if need 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.860
 not even then before anyway 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.690
 eat everything 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.760
 So then it's just like 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.440
 tiramisu so tiramisu you would too 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 Do not stand in the fridge for three weeks 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.640
 let and then eat then yes 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.270
 I have a little bit but again 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.580
 scattered over it so that's what it has 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.340
 not so shiny at night anymore 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.200
 Looks like these fillings are in there 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 or this potato has the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.690
 Of course, very much kaba sucked 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.479
 so just serve it again 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.270
 a bit of cover over it and then yes 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.880
 can you already eat that too then 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.820
 hopefully you have even a little 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.220
 other tutorial liked and then stop 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.630
 just something else I recipe 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.510
 I thought it was something 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.130
 different and still delicious and yes 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.080

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.810
