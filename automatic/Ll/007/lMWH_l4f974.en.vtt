size all the way up to a 72 by 28 but if

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
size all the way up to a 72 by 28 but if
you<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.860> any<00:00:41.010> custom<00:00:41.610> size<00:00:41.879> tanks<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you do have any custom size tanks we

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.740 
you do have any custom size tanks we
actually<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> mold<00:00:43.770> 10<00:00:44.129> foot<00:00:44.399> long<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.879> 6

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
actually have a mold 10 foot long by 6

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually have a mold 10 foot long by 6
foot<00:00:45.960> high<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.920> any<00:00:47.190> size<00:00:47.489> almost

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
foot high so we can do any size almost

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
foot high so we can do any size almost
any<00:00:48.329> size<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> Korean<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> without

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
any size in Korean with that without

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
any size in Korean with that without
needing<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.730> joint<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:52.110> rocky<00:00:52.440> background

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
needing a joint the rocky background

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.389 
needing a joint the rocky background
also<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.480> piece<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.530> use<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.250> we're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
also is the piece that we use when we're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
also is the piece that we use when we're
doing<00:00:56.550> overflow<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.960> an

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
doing overflow so if you have an

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
doing overflow so if you have an
aquarium<00:00:58.469> where<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.070> some<00:00:59.309> overflows

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
aquarium where you have some overflows

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.299 
aquarium where you have some overflows
then<00:01:00.690> typically<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> piece

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
then typically this will be the piece

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.759 
then typically this will be the piece
that<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> we'll<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.290> bend<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that we use and we'll use it and bend it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
that we use and we'll use it and bend it
to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> back<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:06.299> flows<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:06.840> are

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
to do a back over flows which are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.980 
to do a back over flows which are
three-sided<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.659> corner

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
three-sided like that or or the corner

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.100 
three-sided like that or or the corner
ones<00:01:10.170> which<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> two-sided<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.930> makes<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
ones which will be two-sided so makes it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
ones which will be two-sided so makes it
a<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.290> easier<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.130> doesn't<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
a bit easier because it doesn't have so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
a bit easier because it doesn't have so
much<00:01:14.939> definition<00:01:15.680> dimension<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.310> doesn't

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
much definition dimension it doesn't

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.920 
much definition dimension it doesn't
take<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> too<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> tank<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> also

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
take up too much of the tank and also

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
take up too much of the tank and also
makes<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> possible<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.009> us<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> bend<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.000> an

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
makes it possible for us to bend into an

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
makes it possible for us to bend into an
overflow<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.030> use<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.229> then

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
overflow if you do use this I then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
overflow if you do use this I then
you're<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.490> taking<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.880> much<00:01:26.909> air<00:01:27.240> tank<00:01:27.540> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you're not taking up much air tank so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
you're not taking up much air tank so
often<00:01:28.110> you'll<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> decorate<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.400> more

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
often you'll want to decorate a bit more

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
often you'll want to decorate a bit more
giving<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> bit<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.659> three<00:01:30.960> dimension<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
giving a bit more three dimension to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.429 
giving a bit more three dimension to
your<00:01:31.680> tank<00:01:32.070> either<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:32.729> using<00:01:33.000> wood<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.900> using

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
your tank either by using wood or using

even some real rocks that you might have

even some real rocks that you might have
collected<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> years<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.900> keep<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> mind

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the more you play with it the more you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.609 
the more you play with it the more you
create<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.420> better<00:01:45.600> club<00:01:45.930> etter<00:01:46.380> it

create with it the better club etter it
looks<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.189> something<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.240> if

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
looks like something you would see if

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
looks like something you would see if
you<00:01:48.390> went<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> nature<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.439> uh<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:50.100> stop

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
you went to nature so uh don't stop

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.080 
you went to nature so uh don't stop
until<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.450> now<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.759> year<00:01:53.759> ago

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.539 
until you got that look now a year ago
we<00:01:54.329> started<00:01:54.360> making<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.350> backgrounds<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
we started making the backgrounds in a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.330 
we started making the backgrounds in a
rigid<00:01:57.149> foam<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.500> been<00:01:58.680> making<00:01:58.860> products

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
rigid foam we have been making products

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.130 
rigid foam we have been making products
out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.549> foam<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.060> many<00:02:00.240> years<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
out of foam for many years but not as a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
out of foam for many years but not as a
complete<00:02:01.649> item<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:02.460> instead<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
complete item so now instead of the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.969 
complete item so now instead of the
flexible<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> rigid

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
flexible like this we have the rigid

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.150 
flexible like this we have the rigid
like<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.580> same<00:02:09.090> old<00:02:09.420> same<00:02:10.050> color<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
like this so same old same color but you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.670 
like this so same old same color but you
cannot<00:02:11.550> bend<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.690> try<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.200> Bend

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
cannot bend it so if you do try and Bend

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
cannot bend it so if you do try and Bend
you<00:02:14.069> might<00:02:14.340> crack<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.849> or<00:02:14.969> break<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.689> just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you might crack it or break it so just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.679 
you might crack it or break it so just
be<00:02:16.049> very<00:02:16.079> very<00:02:16.349> careful<00:02:16.799> if<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.450> it's

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
be very very careful if you are if it's

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.839 
be very very careful if you are if it's
a<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.349> tight<00:02:19.620> fit<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.069> might<00:02:20.280> need<00:02:20.519> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
a bit of a tight fit you might need to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.390 
a bit of a tight fit you might need to
actually<00:02:21.180> cut<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.200> fit<00:02:22.409> your<00:02:22.439> size<00:02:22.890> inquiry

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually cut it to fit your size inquiry

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.640 
actually cut it to fit your size inquiry
M<00:02:23.609> so<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:25.319> sore<00:02:25.590> small<00:02:26.459> tooth<00:02:26.730> saw

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
M so just a little sore small tooth saw

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
M so just a little sore small tooth saw
will<00:02:28.650> cut<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.040> quite<00:02:29.370> well<00:02:29.640> even<00:02:30.170> scribing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
will cut this quite well even scribing

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.170 
will cut this quite well even scribing
it<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> really<00:02:31.769> sharp<00:02:32.010> bladed<00:02:32.639> knife<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it with a really sharp bladed knife and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.539 
it with a really sharp bladed knife and
then<00:02:33.329> snapping<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.049> when<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.769> cut<00:02:35.159> through

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
then snapping it when it's cut through

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.289 
then snapping it when it's cut through
can<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.950> fit<00:02:38.219> your<00:02:38.370> tank<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.269> I

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
can can make this fit your tank so I

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.839 
can can make this fit your tank so I
just<00:02:39.599> be<00:02:39.750> careful<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.829> break<00:02:41.189> it<00:02:41.459> then

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
just be careful if you do break it then

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.640 
just be careful if you do break it then
you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.209> silicon<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> back<00:02:43.109> with<00:02:43.469> some

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you can silicon it back with some

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.920 
you can silicon it back with some
silicon<00:02:44.129> or<00:02:44.370> even<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> gorilla<00:02:45.359> glue<00:02:45.689> works

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
silicon or even a gorilla glue works

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.949 
silicon or even a gorilla glue works
really<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.319> well<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:48.269> for<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
really really well with that so for a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.429 
really really well with that so for a
reptile<00:02:49.500> tank<00:02:50.599> often<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.810> won't<00:02:52.079> want<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.379> use

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
reptile tank often you won't want to use

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.649 
reptile tank often you won't want to use
just<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.280> clips<00:02:53.639> that<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:54.030> provide<00:02:54.450> these

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
just the clips that we provide these

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.020 
just the clips that we provide these
clips<00:02:55.109> just<00:02:55.349> sit<00:02:55.889> over<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.280> back<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.669> the<00:02:56.790> tent

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
clips just sit over the back of the tent

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.580 
clips just sit over the back of the tent
over<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.419> back<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.750> tank<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.169> also<00:02:58.379> over

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
over the back of the tank and also over

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.099 
over the back of the tank and also over
the<00:02:58.709> top<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.310> background<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.719> trouble

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
the top of the background the trouble

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.619 
the top of the background the trouble
with<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.969> sometimes<00:03:02.969> you<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.209> snakes

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
with that is sometimes you have snakes

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.360 
with that is sometimes you have snakes
and<00:03:03.959> little<00:03:04.319> crickets<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.889> things<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and little crickets and things like that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.099 
and little crickets and things like that
so<00:03:05.549> there<00:03:05.879> might<00:03:06.060> be<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.239> little<00:03:06.450> bit<00:03:06.689> of<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.870> gap

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
so there might be a little bit of a gap

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.770 
so there might be a little bit of a gap
so<00:03:07.739> for<00:03:08.219> a<00:03:08.250> reptile<00:03:08.819> enclosure<00:03:09.060> what<00:03:09.659> I'd

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so for a reptile enclosure what I'd

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.740 
so for a reptile enclosure what I'd
suggest<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.439> do<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:11.750> silicon-silicon

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
suggest you do then is silicon-silicon

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.379 
suggest you do then is silicon-silicon
this<00:03:13.019> back<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.500> place<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.849> best<00:03:15.120> way<00:03:15.359> to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
this back in place and the best way to

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.990 
this back in place and the best way to
do<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> bead<00:03:16.469> of<00:03:16.650> silicon<00:03:17.129> all<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.849> way

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
do that is a bead of silicon all the way

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360 
do that is a bead of silicon all the way
around<00:03:18.389> get<00:03:19.139> yourself<00:03:19.530> some<00:03:19.769> crush<00:03:20.040> rock

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
around get yourself some crush rock

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.659 
around get yourself some crush rock
that's<00:03:20.579> similar<00:03:20.879> colors<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.659> some<00:03:21.930> sins

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
that's similar colors to this some sins

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.550 
that's similar colors to this some sins
sprinkle<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:23.849> in<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.299> then<00:03:24.900> dab<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.409> with

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
sprinkle that in and then dab that with

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.439 
sprinkle that in and then dab that with
a<00:03:25.590> paintbrush<00:03:26.099> while<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:26.609> still<00:03:26.790> wet<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.269> get

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
a paintbrush while it's still wet to get

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.039 
a paintbrush while it's still wet to get
the<00:03:27.599> texture<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.229> of<00:03:29.629> exactly<00:03:30.629> what<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> rock

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the texture of of exactly what the rock

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.729 
the texture of of exactly what the rock
face<00:03:31.260> looks<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:32.479> you<00:03:33.479> can<00:03:33.810> also<00:03:34.109> just<00:03:34.650> put

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
face looks like you can also just put

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.550 
face looks like you can also just put
some<00:03:35.189> silicon<00:03:35.669> on<00:03:35.819> some<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.750> furthest<00:03:37.169> points

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
some silicon on some the furthest points

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
some silicon on some the furthest points
that<00:03:37.709> come<00:03:37.949> back<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.159> touch<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.729> grass<00:03:38.970> but

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
that come back and touch the grass but

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.559 
that come back and touch the grass but
that<00:03:40.379> doesn't<00:03:40.769> seal<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.250> from<00:03:41.370> insects<00:03:41.879> so<00:03:42.120> for

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
that doesn't seal it from insects so for

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.110 
that doesn't seal it from insects so for
reptiles<00:03:43.019> best<00:03:43.560> way<00:03:43.799> as<00:03:43.979> I<00:03:44.099> said<00:03:44.129> all<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.000> way

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
reptiles best way as I said all the way

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.899 
reptiles best way as I said all the way
around<00:03:45.449> with<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:45.780> silicon<00:03:46.259> for<00:03:47.250> aquariums

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
around with the silicon for aquariums

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.789 
around with the silicon for aquariums
all<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.720> need<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.049> do<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.470> use<00:03:49.650> our

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
all you really need to do is use our

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
all you really need to do is use our
black<00:03:50.040> Clips<00:03:50.430> stick<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> over<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.509> top<00:03:51.689> onto
