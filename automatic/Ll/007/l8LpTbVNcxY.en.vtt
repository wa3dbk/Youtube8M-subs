00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.619 

what<00:00:00.989> if<00:00:01.110> suddenly<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.469> RDB<00:00:02.030> is<00:00:03.030> that<00:00:03.419> like

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
what if suddenly is RDB is that like

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.539 
what if suddenly is RDB is that like
within<00:00:03.959> some<00:00:04.529> fighting<00:00:04.950> with<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.100> opponent

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
within some fighting with the opponent

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.280 
within some fighting with the opponent
we're<00:00:05.700> trying<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.150> play<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> energy

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
we're trying to play with the energy

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.850 
we're trying to play with the energy
vectors<00:00:07.710> right<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.200> like<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.620> can

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
vectors right so that like we can

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.190 
vectors right so that like we can
manipulate<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.969> opponent<00:00:12.420> without<00:00:12.870> having

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
manipulate the opponent without having

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.410 
manipulate the opponent without having
to<00:00:13.259> use<00:00:13.380> brute<00:00:13.620> force

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
to use brute force

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.180 
to use brute force
most<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> prop<00:00:15.990> most<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.740> when

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
most of the prop most of the time when

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.390 
most of the prop most of the time when
people<00:00:17.220> push<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.600> right

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
people push on to you like this right

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
people push on to you like this right
through<00:00:20.400> logically<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.270> would<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
through logically you would think that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.359 
through logically you would think that
okay<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> need<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.529> very<00:00:22.560> strong<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
okay I need to be very strong and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
okay I need to be very strong and
backward<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.990> can

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
backward and so on so that I can

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
backward and so on so that I can
accurately<00:00:25.320> turn<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.430> force<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.119> push<00:00:27.330> back

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
accurately turn a force to push back

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.019 
accurately turn a force to push back
into<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.580> such<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
into it but this is actually not such a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.060 
into it but this is actually not such a
good<00:00:30.269> thing<00:00:30.679> if<00:00:31.679> check<00:00:32.040> push<00:00:32.279> harder<00:00:32.700> right

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
good thing if check push harder right

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
good thing if check push harder right
and<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> thing<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.480> stability

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and like the thing is the more stability

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.750 
and like the thing is the more stability
I<00:00:37.950> want<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> give<00:00:38.879> check<00:00:39.180> well<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> try<00:00:40.649> fight<00:00:40.920> by

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I want to give check well I try fight by

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.750 
I want to give check well I try fight by
stabilizing<00:00:42.030> myself<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> more

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
stabilizing myself right the more

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
stabilizing myself right the more
checking<00:00:45.120> issue<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> power<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
checking issue the power because it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
checking issue the power because it's
something<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.890> check<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> work<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.670> okay<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
something for check to work on okay so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810 
something for check to work on okay so
what<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.230> want<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.739> basically<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.700> how

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what you want to do basically and how

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
what you want to do basically and how
easy<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.390> okay<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.260> someone<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.710> pushing

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
easy is this okay if someone is pushing

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
easy is this okay if someone is pushing
on<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.610> stop<00:00:53.850> trying<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> fight<00:00:54.600> him

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
on to you and stop trying to fight him

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.979 
on to you and stop trying to fight him
all<00:00:55.920> right<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.460> trying<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.149> redirect<00:00:57.510> him

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
all right I'm trying to redirect him

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
all right I'm trying to redirect him
right<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:58.739> from<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.489> case<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
right by from some way in this case the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.389 
right by from some way in this case the
check<00:01:00.539> pushes<00:01:00.870> through<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.620> actually

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
check pushes through here I'm actually

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
check pushes through here I'm actually
transferring<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.539> power<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
transferring the power all the way to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.520 
transferring the power all the way to
this<00:01:05.129> hand<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
this hand right

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.969 
this hand right
so<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.650> check<00:01:07.890> pushes<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.439> doesn't<00:01:10.830> take<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so if check pushes but it doesn't take a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
so if check pushes but it doesn't take a
lot<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> force<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
lot of force right I don't even need to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
lot of force right I don't even need to
go<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.890> palace<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.939> need<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> tiny

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
go to this palace and I just need a tiny

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
go to this palace and I just need a tiny
amount<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.229> force<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.770> I'll<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.640> able<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
amount of force and I'll be able to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.480 
amount of force and I'll be able to
return<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.200> power<00:01:19.470> back<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> check<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
return the power back a check and I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
return the power back a check and I
don't<00:01:20.549> need<00:01:21.150> strength<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.320> extends

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
don't need strength to actually extends

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.539 
don't need strength to actually extends
do<00:01:22.890> okay<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.600> returner<00:01:25.170> pop<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:26.280> my

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
do okay now this returner pop is not my

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
do okay now this returner pop is not my
check<00:01:27.060> pushes<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:28.860> check<00:01:29.130> back

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
check pushes here and I put check back

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
check pushes here and I put check back
here<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.930> am<00:01:31.229> still

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here because if I do that I am still

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
here because if I do that I am still
push<00:01:31.710> attack<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> am<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.579> transferred<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
push attack I am not transferred and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
push attack I am not transferred and
still<00:01:34.140> wouldn't<00:01:34.470> work<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.310> only<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> make

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
still wouldn't work the only way to make

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.200 
still wouldn't work the only way to make
it<00:01:36.119> work<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.590> check<00:01:37.799> wishes

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
it work is that like with check wishes

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.080 
it work is that like with check wishes
I'm<00:01:39.210> transferring<00:01:39.979> okay<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.640> purely<00:01:41.909> by

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I'm transferring okay just purely by

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.050 
I'm transferring okay just purely by
transferring<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:44.060> get

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
transferring you can actually like get

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
transferring you can actually like get
the<00:01:45.210> opponent<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.170> battle<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the opponent to go off battle it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.920 
the opponent to go off battle it
straight<00:01:46.860> away<00:01:47.570> okay

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
straight away okay

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.889 
straight away okay
this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> quite<00:01:49.860> obvious<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.299> may<00:01:51.689> take

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
this is quite obvious as that may take

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.350 
this is quite obvious as that may take
this<00:01:52.259> part<00:01:52.560> okay<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> times<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:56.360> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this part okay but a lot of times just I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
this part okay but a lot of times just I
don't<00:01:58.020> need<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> establish<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.189> part<00:01:59.490> for

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
don't need to establish this part for

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
don't need to establish this part for
example<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.320> path<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.829> goes

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
example I can have a path that goes

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.700 
example I can have a path that goes
through<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.570> goes<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.079> my<00:02:04.170> left<00:02:04.380> hand

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
through here it goes from my left hand

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.089 
through here it goes from my left hand
right<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> actually<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> return<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
right and actually like have a return of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.950 
right and actually like have a return of
power<00:02:08.489> through<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.479> bit

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
power through this bit

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.100 
power through this bit
that<00:02:10.740> this<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.270> again<00:02:12.270> there's<00:02:12.690> absolutely

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that this way again there's absolutely

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that this way again there's absolutely
no<00:02:13.890> problem<00:02:14.340> okay<00:02:14.640> how<00:02:14.850> check<00:02:15.120> pushes<00:02:15.480> me

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
no problem okay how check pushes me

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.760 
no problem okay how check pushes me
actually<00:02:17.130> did<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.520> require<00:02:17.940> any<00:02:18.360> force<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
actually did not require any force to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.400 
actually did not require any force to
try<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.910> sustain<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.690> dis<00:02:21.990> pushing

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
try to like sustain this dis pushing

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.510 
try to like sustain this dis pushing
okay<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.170> moved<00:02:25.410> an<00:02:25.770> ally<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.280> from

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
okay so we have moved an ally to be from

from here this big serve it to this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.080 
from here this big serve it to this
little<00:02:30.690> circle<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.560> -<00:02:32.720> okay<00:02:33.720> baby<00:02:35.090> okay

unless<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.390> putting<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.720> one<00:02:42.960> point

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
unless it's putting you on one point

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.950 
unless it's putting you on one point
right<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.220> always<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.880> flat<00:02:45.300> surface<00:02:45.660> of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
right that's always a flat surface of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.160 
right that's always a flat surface of
horses<00:02:46.380> okay<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.850> actually<00:02:48.170> redirect

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
horses okay so I can actually redirect

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.310 
horses okay so I can actually redirect
all<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.560> forces<00:02:49.860> moved<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.120> view<00:02:51.420> this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
all these forces moved in this view this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.990 
all these forces moved in this view this
is<00:02:52.500> hard<00:02:52.740> because<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
is hard because that you have to be

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.700 
is hard because that you have to be
quite<00:02:54.210> precise<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.200> which<00:02:55.350> means<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.620> if

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
quite precise so which means that if

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.650 
quite precise so which means that if
someone<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.160> pushing<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.610> okay

someone is pushing you okay
like<00:02:59.660> still<00:03:00.660> using<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.080> Rav<00:03:01.560> without<00:03:02.340> using

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
like still using the Rav without using

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.210 
like still using the Rav without using
hands<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.180> time<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.560> actually<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
hands this time you can actually do the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.350 
hands this time you can actually do the
return<00:03:05.610> path<00:03:07.250> quite<00:03:08.250> suddenly<00:03:08.640> okay<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.210> is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
return path quite suddenly okay this is

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
return path quite suddenly okay this is
getting<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.840> bit<00:03:10.140> hot<00:03:10.320> now<00:03:10.530> okay<00:03:10.980> let<00:03:11.340> me

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
getting a little bit hot now okay let me

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.200 
getting a little bit hot now okay let me
establish<00:03:11.850> myself<00:03:14.360> okay<00:03:16.580> okay<00:03:18.530> why<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.520> why

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
establish myself okay okay why is it why

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.200 
establish myself okay okay why is it why
is<00:03:21.240> check<00:03:21.630> finding<00:03:21.960> out<00:03:22.050> how<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> put<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.710> over

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
is check finding out how to put it over

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.720 
is check finding out how to put it over
it's<00:03:24.210> because<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:24.990> constantly

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
it's because like I'm constantly

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's because like I'm constantly
changing<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.440> distribution<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.830> false<00:03:29.100> right

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
changing the distribution of false right

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.820 
changing the distribution of false right
here<00:03:29.610> okay<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.840> will<00:03:31.080> not<00:03:31.230> even<00:03:31.470> find<00:03:31.620> that

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
here okay so you will not even find that

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.680 
here okay so you will not even find that
check<00:03:32.100> was<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.370> could<00:03:32.550> try<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.790> chase<00:03:33.150> me<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
check was I could try to chase me to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.260 
check was I could try to chase me to
continue<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.650> push<00:03:34.830> me<00:03:34.980> over<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.060> would

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
continue to push me over but I would

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.300 
continue to push me over but I would
actually<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:38.630> move<00:03:39.710> one<00:03:40.710> step<00:03:40.890> ahead<00:03:41.160> of

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
actually have to move one step ahead of

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.150 
actually have to move one step ahead of
check<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.420> don't<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.690> pushed<00:03:42.930> over

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
check so that I don't get pushed over

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.400 
check so that I don't get pushed over
okay<00:03:44.160> now<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.120> these<00:03:45.300> trained<00:03:45.840> or<00:03:46.140> what

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
okay now with all these trained or what

is practicing right for example like
that<00:03:49.980> let's<00:03:50.340> push<00:03:50.460> it<00:03:50.490> okay<00:03:50.820> what<00:03:51.240> is

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
that let's push it okay what is

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.980 
that let's push it okay what is
practicing<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.050> course<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.870> quite

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
practicing of course like this is quite

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.070 
practicing of course like this is quite
static<00:03:55.320> push<00:03:56.070> on<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.580> want<00:03:56.730> yes<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.900> is

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
static push on if you want yes this is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.810 
static push on if you want yes this is
 static<00:03:58.680> right<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:05.160> course<00:04:05.340> in

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
 static right but like of course in

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.060 
 static right but like of course in
real<00:04:06.030> life<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.780> opponent<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.380> not<00:04:07.410> going<00:04:07.890> to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
real life the opponent is not going to

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.120 
real life the opponent is not going to
stay<00:04:08.730> standing<00:04:09.090> with<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.570> force<00:04:09.900> right<00:04:10.350> so

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
stay standing with this force right so

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.520 
stay standing with this force right so
that<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.580> establish<00:04:11.880> how<00:04:12.330> easy

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that you can establish how easy

that you can establish how easy
standing<00:04:13.830> still<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.400> okay<00:04:14.880> check<00:04:15.510> of

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
standing still like this okay check of

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.629 
standing still like this okay check of

that but I tell me close your ears right
but<00:06:17.580> never<00:06:17.789> cover<00:06:18.030> your<00:06:18.240> ears

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
but never cover your ears

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.120 
but never cover your ears
you're<00:06:19.830> very<00:06:19.950> heard<00:06:20.340> so<00:06:20.700> therefore<00:06:20.880> like

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
you're very heard so therefore like

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.310 
you're very heard so therefore like
that's<00:06:23.130> all<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.400> takes<00:06:23.850> virtually<00:06:24.480> no<00:06:24.660> no

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
that's all it takes virtually no no

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.150 
that's all it takes virtually no no
energy

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
energy

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.060 
energy
so<00:06:26.460> exactly<00:06:26.970> no<00:06:27.360> no<00:06:27.600> no<00:06:27.870> laughter<00:06:28.410> at<00:06:28.620> all<00:06:28.740> and

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
so exactly no no no laughter at all and

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.950 
so exactly no no no laughter at all and
of<00:06:29.400> course<00:06:29.610> like<00:06:29.820> if<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.360> take<00:06:30.540> this<00:06:30.630> one<00:06:30.840> less

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
of course like if you take this one less

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.350 
of course like if you take this one less
step<00:06:31.169> further<00:06:31.470> and<00:06:31.740> I<00:06:31.889> express<00:06:32.400> it<00:06:32.430> more<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:33.060> I

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
step further and I express it more and I

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.580 
step further and I express it more and I
played<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.720> probably<00:06:34.169> more<00:06:34.290> then<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.310> becomes

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
played a probably more then it becomes

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.260 
played a probably more then it becomes
it<00:06:37.590> becomes<00:06:37.740> actually<00:06:38.280> quite<00:06:38.490> powerful<00:06:38.760> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
it becomes actually quite powerful and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.300 
it becomes actually quite powerful and
yet<00:06:39.660> at<00:06:39.960> all<00:06:40.650> times

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
yet at all times

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.050 
yet at all times
you<00:06:41.490> are<00:06:41.639> not<00:06:41.880> using<00:06:42.389> any<00:06:42.570> strength
