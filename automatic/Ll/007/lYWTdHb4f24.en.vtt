like any ender dragon writing mods or

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.590 
like any ender dragon writing mods or
anything<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.030> bucket<00:00:33.390> server

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
anything is just in the bucket server

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
anything is just in the bucket server
it's<00:00:33.809> actually<00:00:34.380> pretty<00:00:34.620> simple<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.850> all

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
it's actually pretty simple to do all

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.119 
it's actually pretty simple to do all
you<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> type<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.850> spell<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.059> mob

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
you do is type in spell and mob

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.729 
you do is type in spell and mob
enderdragon<00:00:41.160> comma<00:00:42.120> dig<00:00:42.870> no<00:00:43.230> space<00:00:43.500> or

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
enderdragon comma dig no space or

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.690 
enderdragon comma dig no space or
anything<00:00:44.120> then<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.300> spawn<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:47.250> will<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
anything then we spawn it it will make a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
anything then we spawn it it will make a
pig<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> do

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pig right on there and then we got to do

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
pig right on there and then we got to do
is<00:00:50.160> I'm<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> gotta<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> saddle<00:00:53.270> then

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is I'm you gotta go get the saddle then

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.200 
is I'm you gotta go get the saddle then
you<00:00:54.449> try<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> saddle<00:00:55.520> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.000> pig

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you try to get the saddle on the pig

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.180 
you try to get the saddle on the pig
it's<00:00:57.360> best<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.379> ocean<00:00:58.800> biome

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it's best to do this on an ocean biome

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's best to do this on an ocean biome
so<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> pig<00:01:00.000> doesn't<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.449> killed<00:01:00.870> by

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so that the pig doesn't get killed by

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.340 
so that the pig doesn't get killed by
the<00:01:02.899> land<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> stuff<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.729> satellite

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the land and stuff so we got satellite

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.480 
the land and stuff so we got satellite
and<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> gotta<00:01:08.370> do<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.840> start<00:01:09.840> writing<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
and all you gotta do is start writing it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.469 
and all you gotta do is start writing it
okay<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.729> order<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.300> have<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
okay so in order to do this you have to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
okay so in order to do this you have to
go<00:01:12.690> in<00:01:12.810> through<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.050> water<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.620> whenever

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
go in through the water because whenever

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.140 
go in through the water because whenever
the<00:01:14.070> thing<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> water<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> starts<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the thing is in the water it starts to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
the thing is in the water it starts to
float<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.810> makes<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.260> whole<00:01:16.470> lot<00:01:16.500> easier<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
float and makes it a whole lot easier to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.230 
float and makes it a whole lot easier to
ride<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.900> now<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:19.020> riding<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.470> holy<00:01:20.250> crap<00:01:20.580> I'm

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
aerial shot at this it looks kind of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.240 
aerial shot at this it looks kind of
sexual<00:01:26.100> whatever<00:01:26.850> oh<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.540> gosh<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.040> riding

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
is about as close as it can get to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
is about as close as it can get to
writing<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.100> editor<00:01:35.310> jack<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> pretty

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
