00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
challenging their tests are some of them

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
challenging their tests are some of them
are<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:56.700> easy<00:01:56.909> some<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> rigorous<00:01:58.020> but

I<00:05:12.690> guess<00:05:13.230> my<00:05:13.380> last<00:05:13.620> question<00:05:13.980> for<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.580> part

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
I guess my last question for this part

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.690 
I guess my last question for this part
of<00:05:15.060> our<00:05:15.180> discussion<00:05:15.330> is<00:05:16.130> what<00:05:17.130> do<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.370> think

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
of our discussion is what do you think

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.110 
of our discussion is what do you think
all<00:05:18.660> of<00:05:18.720> this<00:05:19.320> means<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.040> implications<00:05:20.820> of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
all of this means the implications of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.900 
all of this means the implications of
these<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.800> differences<00:05:23.310> between<00:05:23.340> what's

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
these the differences between what's

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.820 
these the differences between what's
actually<00:05:24.150> happening<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:24.840> Bloomberg's

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
actually happening and Bloomberg's

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.120 
actually happening and Bloomberg's
claims<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.700> success<00:05:27.210> are<00:05:27.660> for<00:05:28.410> mayoral

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
claims of success are for mayoral

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.740 
claims of success are for mayoral
control<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:29.880> scope<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.390> his<00:05:30.570> authority

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
control in the scope of his authority

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.260 
control in the scope of his authority
moving<00:05:31.440> forward<00:05:31.890> well<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.640> think<00:05:32.940> it's<00:05:33.180> just

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
moving forward well I think it's just

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.180 
moving forward well I think it's just
very<00:05:33.510> said<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.229> legislature<00:05:34.860> didn't

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.860 
very said that the legislature didn't
