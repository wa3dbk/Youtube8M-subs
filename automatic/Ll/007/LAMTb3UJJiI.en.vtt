00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
your microchip if you did want to do

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.350 
your microchip if you did want to do
that<00:03:00.560> as<00:03:01.489> far<00:03:01.700> as<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.850> soleplate<00:03:02.060> is

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that as far as the soleplate is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.090 
that as far as the soleplate is
concerned<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:03.200> not<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> sprint<00:03:03.680> frame<00:03:03.860> like

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
concerned it's not a sprint frame like

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.890 
concerned it's not a sprint frame like
the<00:03:04.190> top-end<00:03:04.489> model<00:03:04.820> but<00:03:04.910> again<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.630> doesn't

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the top-end model but again it doesn't

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.509 
the top-end model but again it doesn't
feel<00:03:05.989> cheap<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.470> doesn't<00:03:06.709> feel<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.280> too

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
feel cheap it doesn't feel like it's too

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.310 
feel cheap it doesn't feel like it's too
thin<00:03:07.760> or<00:03:07.940> anything<00:03:08.209> like<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.959> still<00:03:09.200> has

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
thin or anything like that it still has

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.870 
thin or anything like that it still has
a<00:03:09.350> nice<00:03:09.530> bit<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.830> flexibility<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.610> stiffness

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
a nice bit of flexibility and stiffness

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.360 
a nice bit of flexibility and stiffness
to<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.660> right<00:03:11.840> areas<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.500> as<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> whole

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
to it in the right areas and as a whole

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.970 
to it in the right areas and as a whole
is<00:03:13.790> really<00:03:13.850> nice<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> takedown<00:03:14.750> model<00:03:15.230> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
is really nice for a takedown model you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.229 
is really nice for a takedown model you
can<00:03:16.100> see<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> side<00:03:16.489> pattern<00:03:16.790> on<00:03:16.910> here<00:03:17.120> is

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
can see the side pattern on here is

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.759 
can see the side pattern on here is
pretty<00:03:17.480> much<00:03:17.600> identical<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
pretty much identical to that of the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.220 
pretty much identical to that of the
top-end<00:03:19.010> 11pro<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:20.269> basically<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.720> play<00:03:20.989> on

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
top-end 11pro it's basically a play on

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.110 
top-end 11pro it's basically a play on
the<00:03:21.350> predator<00:03:21.739> LZ<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.280> adizero<00:03:22.670> stud<00:03:22.970> pattern

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
the predator LZ and adizero stud pattern

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.390 
the predator LZ and adizero stud pattern
same<00:03:23.780> formation<00:03:24.380> just<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.890> studs<00:03:25.130> instead

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
same formation just up the studs instead

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.520 
same formation just up the studs instead
of<00:03:25.519> being<00:03:25.700> triangular<00:03:26.269> are<00:03:26.750> conical<00:03:27.290> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
of being triangular are conical so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.319 
of being triangular are conical so
you're<00:03:27.620> getting<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.980> more<00:03:28.130> traditional<00:03:28.459> styled

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
you're getting a more traditional styled

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.850 
you're getting a more traditional styled
stud<00:03:29.570> pattern<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.260> particular<00:03:30.709> model

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
stud pattern on this particular model

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680 
stud pattern on this particular model
then<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.610> would<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.970> some<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.480> other

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
then you would on some of the other

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.509 
then you would on some of the other
adidas<00:03:33.140> models<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:33.920> that's<00:03:34.070> pretty<00:03:34.250> much<00:03:34.370> it

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
adidas models but that's pretty much it

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.920 
adidas models but that's pretty much it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.300 
shoe like I said this shoe is just
really<00:04:01.140> surprising<00:04:01.770> in<00:04:01.890> terms<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
really surprising in terms of the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the fit everything about it doesn't feel

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
the fit everything about it doesn't feel
low-end<00:04:07.470> which<00:04:07.710> is<00:04:07.860> really<00:04:08.160> really<00:04:08.280> important

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
low-end which is really really important

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.420 
low-end which is really really important
and<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.900> really<00:04:10.410> great<00:04:10.560> quality<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.010> get<00:04:11.250> from

pretty much any soccer shoe as far as
the<00:04:13.920> sizing<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.400> concerned<00:04:14.730> they<00:04:14.880> definitely

gonna<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.840> little<00:04:28.050> bit<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.230> stretch<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.560> it

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
gonna have a little bit of stretch to it

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.490 
gonna have a little bit of stretch to it
the<00:04:29.730> shoe<00:04:29.880> itself<00:04:30.180> doesn't<00:04:30.570> feel<00:04:30.720> overly<00:04:31.170> wide

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
the shoe itself doesn't feel overly wide

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.470 
the shoe itself doesn't feel overly wide
in<00:04:31.800> my<00:04:31.890> opinion<00:04:32.340> especially<00:04:32.760> because<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.330> do

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
in my opinion especially because you do

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.820 
in my opinion especially because you do
have<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.840> synthetic<00:04:34.080> going<00:04:34.590> through<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
have that synthetic going through the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.890 
have that synthetic going through the
mid-foot<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:35.730> it's<00:04:35.850> not<00:04:36.030> cut<00:04:36.330> too<00:04:36.600> narrow

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
mid-foot but it's not cut too narrow

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.110 
mid-foot but it's not cut too narrow
either<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.920> just<00:04:37.980> keep<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.520> mind<00:04:38.670> of

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
either so just keep that in mind of

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.850 
either so just keep that in mind of
course<00:04:39.420> it<00:04:39.720> does<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.140> lower<00:04:40.410> cut<00:04:40.740> in

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
course it does have that lower cut in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.800 
course it does have that lower cut in
the<00:04:40.950> heel<00:04:41.250> area<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:41.880> shoe<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.600> heel

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
the heel area of the shoe so heel

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.030 
the heel area of the shoe so heel
slippage<00:04:42.990> doesn't<00:04:43.500> seem<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.800> an<00:04:43.920> issue

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
slippage doesn't seem to be an issue

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.040 
slippage doesn't seem to be an issue
right<00:04:44.400> now<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.570> some<00:04:45.720> people<00:04:45.990> if

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
right now but I know for some people if

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.180 
right now but I know for some people if
you<00:04:46.140> do<00:04:46.260> have<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> little<00:04:46.560> bit<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.860> narrower

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
you do have a little bit of a narrower

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.430 
you do have a little bit of a narrower
heel<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:48.120> might<00:04:48.330> run<00:04:48.480> into<00:04:48.690> some<00:04:48.810> issues<00:04:49.290> with

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
heel you might run into some issues with

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.720 
heel you might run into some issues with
heel<00:04:49.590> slippage<00:04:49.830> because<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.190> heel<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.640> a

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
heel slippage because the heel is a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.760 
heel slippage because the heel is a
little<00:04:50.850> bit<00:04:51.180> wider<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:51.780> just<00:04:52.290> keep<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.620> in

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
little bit wider so just keep that in

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.180 
little bit wider so just keep that in
mind

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
mind

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.800 
mind
other<00:04:53.610> than<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:53.790> hopefully<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.510> feels<00:04:54.660> nice

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
other than that hopefully it feels nice

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.780 
other than that hopefully it feels nice
and<00:04:55.050> flexible<00:04:55.380> nothing<00:04:56.220> feels<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.640> it's

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
and flexible nothing feels like it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.060 
and flexible nothing feels like it's
chafing<00:04:57.180> or<00:04:57.300> anything<00:04:57.480> like<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.169> from
