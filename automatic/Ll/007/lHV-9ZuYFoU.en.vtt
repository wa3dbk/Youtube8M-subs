00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
in put it up take a look at the content
the<00:00:19.949> DVD<00:00:25.130> okay

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the DVD okay

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.879 
the DVD okay
quite<00:00:28.649> heavy<00:00:28.829> I<00:00:30.109> thought<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.289> box<00:00:31.589> of<00:00:31.710> light

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:31.889 
quite heavy I thought was a box of light

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:33.169 
quite heavy I thought was a box of light
board<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.340> us<00:00:32.460> hmm

00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:33.179 
board for us hmm

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:35.599 
board for us hmm
but<00:00:34.019> it<00:00:34.140> did<00:00:34.289> does<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:34.859> complete<00:00:35.250> waterproof

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
but it did does they complete waterproof

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.400 
but it did does they complete waterproof
so<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.239> pretty<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:38.089> s2<00:00:39.089> 15s<00:00:39.839> lipo

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so that's pretty good for s2 15s lipo

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.169 
so that's pretty good for s2 15s lipo
Maxis<00:00:41.190> 380<00:00:41.969> amps<00:00:43.429> my<00:00:44.429> board<00:00:44.699> don't<00:00:44.820> require

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
Maxis 380 amps my board don't require

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.989 
Maxis 380 amps my board don't require
this<00:00:45.420> much<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.019> I<00:00:46.289> bought<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> anyway<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
this much but I bought it anyway just to

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.150 
this much but I bought it anyway just to
make<00:00:48.089> sure<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.929> handle<00:00:49.620> anything<00:00:49.949> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
make sure that it can handle anything I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.810 
make sure that it can handle anything I
throw<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
throw at it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
throw at it
I<00:00:51.320> might<00:00:52.320> try<00:00:52.499> to<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:52.859> this<00:00:53.010> thing<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I might try to put it this thing in a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.739 
I might try to put it this thing in a
bigger<00:00:53.820> board<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.359> future<00:00:56.539> well<00:00:57.539> right

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
bigger board in the future well right

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:09.770 
bigger board in the future well right
away<00:00:57.870> let<00:00:58.649> me<00:00:58.769> see<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> switch<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.780> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
away let me see the switch and it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
away let me see the switch and it
doesn't<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> b<00:01:10.770> ec<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.119> have

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
doesn't have a b ec so this one you have

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.810 
doesn't have a b ec so this one you have
to<00:01:12.329> hook<00:01:12.509> up<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.899> battery<00:01:13.439> separately<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to hook up the battery separately and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.139 
to hook up the battery separately and
that's<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.149> one<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.899> receiver

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.620 

has<00:01:24.149> eight<00:01:25.110> gauge<00:01:25.469> wires<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.729> thick<00:01:27.030> quite

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
has eight gauge wires pretty thick quite

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.400 
has eight gauge wires pretty thick quite
thick<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> an<00:01:29.430> anti<00:01:29.850> spark<00:01:30.590> wire

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.100 

and<00:01:38.410> of<00:01:38.530> course<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:38.860> cycle<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.310> motor

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and of course this cycle to the motor

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.130 
and of course this cycle to the motor
and<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.200> got<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.440> water<00:01:41.650> cooling<00:01:41.950> line<00:01:43.140> only

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
and you got the water cooling line only

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.080 
and you got the water cooling line only
on<00:01:44.260> one<00:01:44.440> end<00:01:44.680> so<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.220> guess<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.700> moved<00:01:45.880> around

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
on one end so I guess it moved around

00:01:46.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
on one end so I guess it moved around
inside<00:01:49.830> okay<00:01:50.830> load<00:01:51.100> instruction<00:01:51.700> booklet

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.490 

okay<00:02:04.450> good<00:02:04.780> they<00:02:04.960> got<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> diagram<00:02:07.380> easier<00:02:08.380> to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
okay good they got the diagram easier to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.620 
okay good they got the diagram easier to
see<00:02:08.710> now<00:02:14.490> one<00:02:15.490> thing<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:16.150> notice<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
see now one thing you can notice the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.110 
see now one thing you can notice the
diagram<00:02:17.080> says<00:02:17.520> when<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.610> hook<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:18.880> dual

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
diagram says when you hook up dual

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.460 
diagram says when you hook up dual
battery<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.820> gotta<00:02:22.030> hook<00:02:22.180> them<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.480> according

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
battery you gotta hook them up according

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.520 
battery you gotta hook them up according
to<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:24.120> diagram<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:29.080> one

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to this diagram not this one

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.680 
to this diagram not this one
and<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:32.910> most<00:02:33.910> ESC<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.540> would

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and not like that most ESC you would

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.810 
and not like that most ESC you would
think<00:02:35.410> each<00:02:37.830> each<00:02:38.830> wire<00:02:39.130> goes<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.640> each

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
think each each wire goes to each

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210 
think each each wire goes to each
battery<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:40.540> now<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.440> has<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.070> go<00:02:42.190> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
battery but now this one has to go to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.250 
battery but now this one has to go to
both

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
both

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.240 
both
so<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:44.380> got<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.739> solder<00:02:45.010> these<00:02:45.280> together

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
so I'm got to solder these together

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.800 
so I'm got to solder these together
black<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.489> black<00:02:48.610> red<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:48.970> red<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:49.600> run

black and black red and red and then run

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.740 
black and black red and red and then run
to<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.110> battery<00:02:51.180> mmm<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.390> also<00:02:52.840> ordered<00:02:53.410> the
