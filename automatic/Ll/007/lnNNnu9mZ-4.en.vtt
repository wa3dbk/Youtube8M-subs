00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.529
 but 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.009
 hi hello hello chilpayates how are 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 them lips and the former boss and this is less 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.430
 grings the fun we start today we go 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 to talk about the beverage mix 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.629
 alcoholics with energy drinks 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.879
 I'm typical that you get to the party and 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.040
 you say throw you eat something that puts me 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.170
 also at the party if the clear effect 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 typical that we all arrived at the party 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.760
 approach the bar with the bartender 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 you ask two writers greens and they serve you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.339
 something that you do not know, but it's going to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.449
 make super popov look at the party but 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.520
 that does not even know that you're 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:02.539
 taking if I have a foaming baby 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.539
 shower or advice from 30 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.520
 and the conclusion is not because it is drink 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.800
 alcoholic with an energizing drink 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.690
 aha and you already stay the same but 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.000
 contain these drinks that is the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.149
 question of the day of those drinks no more 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 or less that they contain we do them the 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.869
 good favor has countless things 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.030
 but the main ones are flour and not 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 nothing else that also has caffeine and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 these are stimulants 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.760
 dangerous combined with drinks 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.380
 alcoholics you have to be very clear about that 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.190
 most have distinguished chemicals as 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.560
 artificial colors and flavors 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.200
 with coronal light acton 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 you know what that is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.909
 you know what that is, let's ask 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.880
 outside, we went out to ask him 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.759
 to the band if they know they contain 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.420
 energy drinks come back then 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.420
 some have taurine caffeine 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.909
 and in general as sugars that make us 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.330
 how can you be more have more energy 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.690
 and be active and average so the ways 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 energetics have taurine dyes 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.230
 artificial and many many or much 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 sugar I do not know myself so today I think 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.620
 they have taurine and some have 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660
 caffeine concentrations but I'm not 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.000
 sure they give you a lot of energy for the same 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 sugar they have and caffeine and take the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.260
 redbull pull taurines or something like that but it's 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 the only thing I know I could not say more 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.750
 when we mix energy drinks with 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.730
 alcohol is worse because the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.519
 mix of the energy drink with the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.549
 alcohol causes your body not to peel and 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.500
 is going to the amount of alcohol you're 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.340
 taking no and you can tell 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.720
 after 1000 hours but what not 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.760
 you realize that your body is already 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.129
 intoxicated not because you can go on and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.840
 continue and continue taking but then as 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.510
 disguising the energy drink 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.819
 alcohol because you do not feel anything 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.220
 stands out in the total pachanga of bread 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.159
 exact but when your body already 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.540
 processed the energy drink is already 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.120
 when he comes to do his job on 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.090
 alcohol not then this one is more serious 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.379
 very deceitful exactly we go outside to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.780
 see if you've had drinks 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.739
 energizers with alcohol and that perhaps 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.950
 it would be but it is a bit contradictory 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.079
 drink alcoholic beverages with those 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.109
 energizing comedies because alcohol 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.659
 it is inhibited or it is as if your 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.740
 system this as stunned and the 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.440
 energizers do that what 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.380
 with samÃ¡n that exalts you is then like 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.660
 that if you combine them like that you 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.300
 the substances to your brain do you wrong 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.000
 and he does not know how to react is like 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.580
 deceiving not because according to me so first 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.210
 it relaxes your nervous system and then 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.780
 you can alter it a lot because they are 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:09.360
 having a cardiac payment does not increase what 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.130
 it is a blood and respiratory flow 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.980
 I have mixed drinks and they produce me 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.959
 a high drain line and then if my 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.100
 more season I enjoy a little better 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.770
 as far as I know energy drinks 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.920
 accelerate heart rate and this one 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.950
 that if you mix it with alcohol apart 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.480
 I think that as this accelerates the 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.700
 circulation 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.040
 I understand that they are faster 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.570
 effects of alcohol is good so good 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.190
 well fine the skills how to predict 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.860
 the mind can alter the blacks you 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.050
 can give a cardiac arrest 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.060
 good as we realized that from the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.189
 blend of energizing beverages with 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.349
 alcoholic drinks is like wanting to cover 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.000
 the sun with just one finger the only thing 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.280
 does the energizing drink is to cover 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.090
 the greens that we are taking 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.909
 exactly only they are 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.349
 disguising but remember the process 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.719
 of alcohol removal from our 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.270
 organism is one hour for men and 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.740
 an hour and a half for women there is no need 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.719
 take to the beast really there's no 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.270
 no need no and also you have to 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.699
 keep in mind that it is greater than one 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.430
 younger age is drunk the damage is going to 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.500
 be older not clear and women have 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.210
 that being much more careful is not 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.490
 mix of alcohol with drinks 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.259
 energizers take it during the 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.060
 menstruation if you are taking any 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.340
 contraceptive or even during the 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.069
 pregnancy is much more clear risks and 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.949
 remember, there are three glasses for women and 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.050
 four for men but by or almost in 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.150
 exactly and try 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.909
 intercalate alcoholic beverages with or 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.729
 alcoholic or some other food 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:45.860
 Exactly well, good guys this was - 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.860
 grings more fun until next time
