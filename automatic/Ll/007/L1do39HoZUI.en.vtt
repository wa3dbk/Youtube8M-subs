00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.990
 Hello today I introduce you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:33.610
 davoser team from 40 millimeters it is 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:39.940
 an automatic with demeter 28 24 13 clock 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:45.070
 The mountain is simply known 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:52.540
 Long live tractor under the upper corners 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:01:01.300
 I exactly and very reliable the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:08.950
 thermos flask 40 mm is a tribute to the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:11.979
 rolex submariner and she actually has 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.380
 the same dimensions in total as 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.729
 the original rolex watch 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.130
 in my opinion that is over there 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:27.390
 termes 40 mm the best tribute to it 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 in the market 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:47.159
 high quality processed housing 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:51.560
 Bracelet bezel of course ceramic countries 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.560
 Of course, this is a must in this exercise 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.110
 what else i wanted to say the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 reference number of the clock is 161 555 50 it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.899
 is the latest model from 2015, her 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.190
 already seen in my other video 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.769
 have or 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.180
 I had not seen them yet 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:22.430
 already in green so green bezel and 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.459
 green dial two are very 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.459
 send out 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.739
 in the choice between both I see 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.130
 Of course black before because here easy 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:42.630
 the contrast is even better and 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:48.480
 even more to the original rolex 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:54.170
 submariner leans as you can see 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.170
 flanks very nicely processed 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.170
 very exactly ground, and a belt- 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.170
 clean bumps 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.150
 back here with the name 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:33.549
 The band is processed with high quality 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:41.650
 an extension like the name already 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:43.810
 says is a diver watch if you have the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.890
 you can dive here 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:54.700
 dive extension and look over the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.780
 cover wetsuit 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.780
 so can 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.890
 closes very well 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.500
 wearing comfort will be rosat it really is 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:16.970
 surprisingly good it does not hurt anything 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.970
 she is really perfect 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.329
