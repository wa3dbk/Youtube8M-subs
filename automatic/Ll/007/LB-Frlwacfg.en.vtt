00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.610
 he 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.090
 hello to all and benji we get 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.860
 found today for a new 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.560
 video on super smash bros fort wiiu 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.230
 so this time it's the fifth 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.320
 video on make this match so I 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.050
 plays against an American who was no 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.759
 classified and unlike unclassified 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.829
 to the unclassified players that you have 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.630
 played during the round this match number 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.950
 three there this time there has not been 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.720
 big surprise so we'll go 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.670
 directly match I play donkey kong 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.770
 obviously you are all of them and my 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.060
 opponent is not playing fight na or for the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.320
 now it's pretty tight there is no 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.880
 none of the two pairs neither 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.200
 players took a big advantage there I 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.060
 go but a little b gives I do not chained 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.100
 not just behind it is a little bit 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.530
 pity so here I try to touch with 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 bins r a small job 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.590
 a little air I tell the father I put 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 a small a small ferry is web so and the 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.670
 deathmatch on landing to punish 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.570
 his sound dodges in the wind so if 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.610
 you see small slowdowns 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.350
 it's just because I laughed 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.670
 live ropes in celebration and so on if 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.090
 there were small passages 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580
 of lacq 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 So already there I found her 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.270
 storage whereas I had that 65% I 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.680
 tries the spike that would not hit 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.130
 because he spends once in 40 years 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.990
 40 billion little by little move in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.070
 back to get up I'm waiting 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.810
 that they go it just lands 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.479
 in front of me I put the b neutral it goes 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.420
 bartering and so there I already have my bep note 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.130
 ready to prepare the next is KB 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.330
 this is the little one he kills his father he thought 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.140
 that I was going to redo a benchmark I do not 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.820
 do not make losses 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.100
 I will wait then he had placed his 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 account meanwhile game i'm waiting 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.130
 quietly he lands on the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.080
 field I put my bep our winter 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.330
 room that gave him is quite light 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 first match won by 3 stocks 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.200
 there is no there has not been 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.570
 really match so we'll go 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.049
 directly to the second match and I do not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.200
 do not fool me then for the second 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.560
 match i'm the captain falcon my 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.990
 opponent is not fight na and that's it I 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.240
 had already taken him out on a 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.220
 video - captain falcon of the scammed but 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.950
 he's back since my opponent 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.390
 is not or smoking good I told myself that 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.220
 I was going to be able to get out my little 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.320
 captain falcon so I'll be able to you 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 show what I mean by a 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.350
 captain falcon larnaca wholesale 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.030
 base already to which you do not have a 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.700
 excellent level to captain falcon 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.930
 when I could already go 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.790
 deathmatch up so that I could 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.630
 I put them avoid berries gives 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.950
 soil so that's ridiculous so there for the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.600
 moment the match is pretty much 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.980
 balanced in 51 79 % it's pretty tight 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.870
 here is the Bedouin who does not serve absolutely 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.280
 nothing I take his attack at the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.490
 raise 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 there I take the little classic combo 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.890
 so the grade of the bass mug plus the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.920
 father there I miss a little bit all my 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.670
 blows I put my agent the maine 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.870
 I try the nose guard here 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.280
 first round 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.320
 so I tried to induce 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.670
 hospitals that had not passed I fair 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.020
 completely given guard behind and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.730
 for not me I had mid-March 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.350
 I used Marc Aubry during this 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.890
 time parity has also put its 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.630
 recovery 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.090
 actually when not fighting 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.100
 does not appear I have the moment when I 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.280
 can catch with marc recovery and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.960
 blow I let go of the stage this fight and I the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.220
 kill right behind so that's first 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.050
 stock removed with a little scam 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.670
 form to words what I mean by a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.320
 generally access lucky shots 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.090
 the first stroke of luck or first 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.490
 scam 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.820
 there I kneel in the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.860
 chill 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.360
 obviously it's okay we're not going to 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.470
 lie he spies he is not very good 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.270
 but there are still limits to the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.860
 bullshit 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.890
 so here I am taking a b side 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.060
 when I was not even on the ground it's 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.130
 not beautiful is not beautiful to see 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.390
 so here I put a little gentlemen I 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.900
 will try to guard ob gives and without 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.460
 messing it up can not work anymore 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.840
 your opponent does not expect it I 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.730
 misses world I keep it once again I 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.280
 miss again world guard at her the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.590
 range that sticks to the skiff age for a 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.150
 times at his ex match so there I their 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.910
 send once again to the void 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.970
 I told to keep bible biker 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.380
 pic Paul as he comes out of his 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.769
 recovery of a second small scam 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.110
 because clearly there 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.490
 the force with which I do not touch him 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.449
 fight did it really was the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.740
 any end of my bottom of my bac r &amp; c joy 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.909
 there I really had very little chance 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.729
 to touch him to his good at the end brief 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.930
 second little stroke of luck and that's it 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.550
 I 'm still getting a stock 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.190
 so that will not be a double 3 stocks 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.569
 besides that but finally I crack of 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.550
 memories I have no place and falcon 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.810
 koch which is a little amazing and and ben 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.379
 here and here 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.949
 beautiful a little to be at the ferry and rdr 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.930
 good then for all those who know 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.400
 end do not know too much this combo does not 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.680
 not pass it's not true we're not going to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.250
 lie in short this is the first fight 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.500
 quietly won two games to zero 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.009
 to the opponent was not incredibly 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.810
 good but it does taf 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.120
 on this I tell you to the next for 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.000
 my sixth ladder match and if you 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.139
 want to join the golden ace yet 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.780
 once I put you the link in the 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.780
 description on those next
