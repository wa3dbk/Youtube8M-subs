I got my new iPad air 2 yesterday with

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.629 
I got my new iPad air 2 yesterday with
the<00:00:05.600> 64<00:00:06.600> gigabyte<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.200> storage<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.280> in

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the 64 gigabyte of storage and it's in

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.390 
the 64 gigabyte of storage and it's in
gold<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.780> very<00:00:10.320> very<00:00:10.469> beautiful<00:00:10.889> I

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
gold and it's very very beautiful I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.530 
gold and it's very very beautiful I
really<00:00:12.059> like<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.630> gold<00:00:13.429> color<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.330> don't

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
really like this gold color and I don't

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.400

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
think the color has an another tonne of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.359 
think the color has an another tonne of
gold<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:20.310> died<00:00:20.910> from<00:00:21.150> success<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> me<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
gold as died from success to me is the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.470 
gold as died from success to me is the
same<00:00:23.730> gold<00:00:24.449> color<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.710> ipad<00:00:26.189> air<00:00:26.340> 2<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.880> an

same gold color and my ipad air 2 is an
LTE<00:00:28.080> version<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.099> has<00:00:29.429> 4g<00:00:30.390> connection

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
LTE version so it has 4g connection

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680 
LTE version so it has 4g connection
cellular<00:00:31.859> connection<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.120> new<00:00:33.329> thinness

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
cellular connection and the new thinness

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.220 
cellular connection and the new thinness
of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> ipad<00:00:34.950> air<00:00:35.130> 2<00:00:35.160> makes<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.880> feel<00:00:36.420> smaller

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of the ipad air 2 makes it feel smaller

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280

than the ipad air one when you hold it
the<00:00:41.219> weight<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.079> huge<00:00:43.260> difference

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the weight is not so huge difference

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.299 
the weight is not so huge difference
between<00:00:44.219> ipad<00:00:44.550> i<00:00:44.670> 1<00:00:44.850> &amp;<00:00:45.120> 2<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.980> notice

a tiny bit lighter device but the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
a tiny bit lighter device but the
thinness<00:00:52.739> makes<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.539> biggest

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
thinness makes it the the biggest

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.189 
thinness makes it the the biggest
difference<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.649> comes<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> size<00:00:57.930> of

to<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> famous<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> i<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.700> think

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to the famous of it and i also think

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
to the famous of it and i also think
that<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> white<00:01:25.200> vessels<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> front

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that the white vessels on the front

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
that the white vessels on the front
makes<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.509> feel<00:01:27.810> small<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.680> too<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> feels

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
makes it feel small or too so it feels

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.560 
makes it feel small or too so it feels
more<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.030> an<00:01:30.390> iPad<00:01:30.960> Mini<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
more like an iPad Mini now when I use it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
more like an iPad Mini now when I use it
in<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> good<00:01:33.869> way<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.400> that's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> huge

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
in a good way so I think that's a huge

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.530 
in a good way so I think that's a huge
difference<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:38.040> too<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.299> had

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
difference for me too because I have had

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.639 
difference for me too because I have had
black<00:01:40.350> bezels<00:01:40.979> before<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.049> white<00:01:43.049> person

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
black bezels before now a white person

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
black bezels before now a white person
so<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.340> feels<00:01:44.670> smaller<00:01:45.149> thanks<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> one

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so it feels smaller thanks to that one

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
so it feels smaller thanks to that one
thing<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.979> too<00:01:47.369> bad<00:01:47.579> though<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.119> now

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
thing that's too bad though is that now

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.710 
thing that's too bad though is that now
it<00:01:48.899> when<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.590> touch<00:01:50.159> ID<00:01:50.549> button<00:01:50.970> why<00:01:51.420> not

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it when it has touch ID button why not

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
it when it has touch ID button why not
have<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.890> new<00:01:53.159> reachability<00:01:53.850> feature<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have the new reachability feature on it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.910 
have the new reachability feature on it
too<00:01:55.219> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.380> portrait<00:01:58.380> mode<00:01:58.409> for

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
too if you use it in portrait mode for

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.700 
too if you use it in portrait mode for
example<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.750> use<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> ipod<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
example so if you use the ipod to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.590 
example so if you use the ipod to
imported<00:02:02.219> mode<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.909> cool<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
imported mode it would be cool to have

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.679 
imported mode it would be cool to have
the<00:02:03.810> rich<00:02:04.020> ability<00:02:04.799> feature<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.540> exactly<00:02:06.540> as

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the rich ability feature to exactly as

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479 
the rich ability feature to exactly as
you<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.140> iphone<00:02:07.469> 6<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> iphone<00:02:08.009> 6<00:02:08.369> plus

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you have an iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.479 
you have an iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus
but<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.420> surprised<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.590> most<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
but what surprised me the most is that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.830 
but what surprised me the most is that
the<00:02:12.330> perf

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the perf

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.170

it's<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.319> fast<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.340> apps<00:02:17.940> opens<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.560> fast

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's so fast now apps opens really fast

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's so fast now apps opens really fast
you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.209> scroll<00:02:21.540> between<00:02:21.810> apps<00:02:22.379> really<00:02:23.010> fast

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you can scroll between apps really fast

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.869 
you can scroll between apps really fast
even<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> VV<00:02:25.170> connection<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.879> incredible

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
even the VV connection is incredible

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.360 
even the VV connection is incredible
fast<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:29.370> has<00:02:29.730> never<00:02:30.180> been<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.019> good<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.830> my

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
fast it has never been so good at my

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.020 
fast it has never been so good at my
home<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.299> even<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> router<00:02:35.400> with

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
home and I even don't have a router with

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.280 
home and I even don't have a router with
AC<00:02:36.950> router<00:02:37.950> connection<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.000> only<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.019> n

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
AC router connection I only have the n

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.640 
AC router connection I only have the n
router<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.849> can<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.180> feel<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
router and you can actually feel that it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.180 
router and you can actually feel that it
has<00:02:43.890> two<00:02:44.310> gigabyte<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:45.030> RAM<00:02:45.299> now<00:02:45.769> all<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.010> apps

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
has two gigabyte of RAM now all the apps

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.150 
has two gigabyte of RAM now all the apps
is<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.790> lot<00:02:48.000> faster<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:49.140> don't<00:02:49.349> reload

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
is a lot faster and they don't reload

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
is a lot faster and they don't reload
and<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.269> switch<00:02:51.840> between<00:02:52.079> them

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and so on you can switch between them

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.150 
and so on you can switch between them
much<00:02:52.980> easier<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.349> highly

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
much easier and so on that is highly

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.199 
much easier and so on that is highly
noticeable<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.500> speed<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.220> more<00:02:59.849> RAM

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
noticeable so the speed and more RAM

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.819 
noticeable so the speed and more RAM
makes<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.940> worth<00:03:02.940> upgrading<00:03:03.360> from<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.440> ipod

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
makes it worth upgrading from the ipod

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.280 
makes it worth upgrading from the ipod

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
on the ipad air 2 so I thought the smart

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.480 
on the ipad air 2 so I thought the smart
cover<00:05:30.940> was<00:05:31.180> only<00:05:31.750> for<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.110> ipad<00:05:32.440> air<00:05:32.560> one<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.190> i

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
cover was only for the ipad air one so i

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.890 
cover was only for the ipad air one so i
have<00:05:34.150> order<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.900> new<00:05:35.380> smart<00:05:35.919> cover<00:05:36.780> for<00:05:37.780> the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
ipad air 2 but apparently that is the

ipad air 2 but apparently that is the
same<00:05:42.270> smart<00:05:43.270> cover<00:05:43.539> so<00:05:43.900> they<00:05:44.440> support<00:05:44.919> both

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690
