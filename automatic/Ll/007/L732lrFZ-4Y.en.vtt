00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.820
 A) Yes 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.650
 Now he talks to them for the happy 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.480
 android today I bring you the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 review of a very interesting application 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.379
 and the application is called ss 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.630
 remember if what to do this application 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.130
 is that it will allow us to record the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.930
 screen of our android device 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.730
 to use this application we need 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.140
 be a root user so good yes no 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.940
 they like on your phone here they 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.040
 I leave the video to see more or less 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.960
 how to do the procedure but when 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.940
 the application is free and its version 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.940
 pay the paid version up to 80 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.260
 84 pesos seems to me and they go to the only 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.480
 difference is that one comes with a 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.970
 watermark of the application and the other 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 the own version comes free on the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.239
 very clean screen then good if 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 they are going to occupy a lot of this application 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 It is worth buying the paid application if it is 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.700
 only to share some video with 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.620
 your friends how to pass a level of a 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.760
 I play something like that because the version 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.590
 free will work perfectly 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.700
 so good they will be able to download is 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.110
 of the place tort 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.520
 in the description I leave the links to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.140
 the free version and the version of 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.489
 Pay with the application works very 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.960
 simple here we are going to open the version 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.980
 free and as I say it is the same 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.170
 simply that the version 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 and for free you're just going to always have 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.650
 this brand from here then they were going to 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.240
 you are very upset to have to 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.890
 buy the paid version and good here 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 are the settings here we can modify 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.369
 several things and we can make it record 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.190
 the phone's microphone is so 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.900
 when we are recording on the screen 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.700
 we can also talk and say good I 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.380
 I went to this level so it was good 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.820
 what happens to me now we can 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.430
 change the resolution in this case what 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.300
 had in full resolution but 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.909
 you can also change it not be 720 thousand 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.920
 84 88 here the one of thousand 85 less is wrong 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.899
 resolution that 720 then when 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.300
 depending on your phone if its by itself 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.649
 your phone is powerful put it on 720 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.539
 if it's not so much maybe a 480 a 360 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.860
 there as you see it works well 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.289
 the application in this case we are going to 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.720
 leave for example at 720 and here they are 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.420
 the frames and I always left it at 30 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.979
 but in 20 it works well that's the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.090
 frames that pass by second 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.530
 so good for example that we're going to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.690
 leave in twenty-one have wanted to know 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.070
 pretty good here is the option to 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.630
 remove this but it will send us 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 download the pro version so good 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.479
 If you want as I say, remove this 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.250
 watermark that will always be 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.880
 appearing simply have to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.710
 buy it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.290
 and it's the only difference between these two 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.940
 versions of everything is here is the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.490
 transformation of the image that is by 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.530
 gpu and cpu and I recommend that it be for 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 gpu and once they configure that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.800
 just line ok and to start 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.360
 record the screen the only thing we have 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.430
 what to do is tighten who says he is 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.050
 and good as a blinking 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 which means that you are already 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.530
 recording the screen will feel the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.990
 beginning a little lacquer a little bit of 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.970
 like your phone is locked and maybe 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.590
 on camera you do not notice much but one that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 is using the phone that uses it 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.700
 daily is if you feel it and it goes here 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.400
 You could put a any application 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.770
 I could play some game that does not require 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 of so much because if they play a game that 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.990
 it requires a lot of processing and they are 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.700
 recording I do not know at 30 frames per second 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.320
 Well your phone will actually be 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.210
 super slow is not going to run well the game 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.980
 but a simple game for example a 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.390
 candy coach is going to run to the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 perfection that are recording and good 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.830
 suppose they already want to finish 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.360
 record what they can do is go here 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.819
 notification center and just 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.650
 touch here 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.150
 already stopped recording and then to be able 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.379
 access the video is enough in our 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.879
 gallery that we can close this 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.109
 application here in the center of 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.150
 equal notifications will you reach the 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.739
 notification but today just 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.239
 play the video and it sounded a lot 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.680
 audio then I'm recording this part 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.510
 again but hey we just 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 we go to the gallery and here in the gallery 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.109
 is going to create this folder that is going to say 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 write corder and go here is the video 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.769
 that we just did just I what 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.379
 could play here and we're going to 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.000
 reproduce normality I can see all 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.739
 the recording as you saw it 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.810
 as they see 20 pictures it looks pretty 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.159
 good and good that's how this works 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.629
 application as I tell you there is not much 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.189
 difference between the free version and the 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.900
 pay version simply this brand 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.219
 of water all the two applications go to 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.780
 work in the same way so 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.430
 well this would be all thank you very much for 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.049
