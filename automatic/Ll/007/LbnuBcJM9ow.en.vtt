all<00:01:08.460> Nintendo<00:01:08.939> would<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.290> do

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
all Nintendo would have to really do

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
all Nintendo would have to really do
just<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> hit<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> couple<00:01:11.939> buttons<00:01:12.150> boom

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

you're Shadow the Hedgehog
and<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.830> what<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.070> assume

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and that would be what I would assume

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.020 
and that would be what I would assume
probably<00:01:18.330> very<00:01:18.600> likely<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.320> point<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
probably very likely at this point I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710 
probably very likely at this point I
would<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> Sonic<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.220> gonna<00:01:23.720> if

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
would say that Sonic is not gonna if

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.830 
would say that Sonic is not gonna if
Nintendo<00:01:25.439> brings<00:01:26.340> another<00:01:26.909> sonic<00:01:27.420> character

Nintendo brings another sonic character

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
Nintendo brings another sonic character
into<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> franchise<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:30.000> Smash<00:01:30.329> Brothers

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
into the franchise of Smash Brothers

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
into the franchise of Smash Brothers
it's<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.650> shadow<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.670> him<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's not gonna be shadow because him in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's not gonna be shadow because him in
Sonic<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.110> alike<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.520> were

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
Sonic are way too alike if they were

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.010

gonna<00:01:35.759> bring<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.210> another<00:01:36.329> character<00:01:36.540> would

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
gonna bring in another character would

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.490 
gonna bring in another character would
probably<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.710> tails<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.210> knuckles<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.259> not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
probably be tails or knuckles but not

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560 
probably be tails or knuckles but not
shadow<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.420> do

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
shadow because all they would have to do

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
shadow because all they would have to do
is<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.340> very

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is do that and I think that's a very

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
is do that and I think that's a very
high<00:01:44.850> possibility<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.590> them

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
high possibility and I can see them

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
high possibility and I can see them
doing<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.369> other<00:01:47.610> characters<00:01:48.149> you
