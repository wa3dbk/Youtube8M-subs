00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.400
 great desire for all guys I am 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.290
 mister bounty today I'm back on pippa 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.539
 15 to bring you new reviews 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 of cards issued on fifa last i 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.770
 teams related to the players they are 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.280
 arrived in the series with the market 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.520
 wintry 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.710
 ended February 2 last time 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.210
 I talked about cerci podolski kg 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 while this time I'll bring two 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.350
 strikers and a first defender 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.329
 player we analyze is samuel eto'o 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.239
 of the sampdoria that you had many of me 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 asked last time from the comments between 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.450
 let's start by saying that eto'o is a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.900
 striker and has an overall value 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 of 81 the value of eto'o is without a doubt 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.230
 that of being a very player 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 mobile that you will always find at 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.270
 right place at the right time 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.560
 especially inside the penalty area 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.060
 sometimes it happened to me though 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.250
 see it completely still above all 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.570
 when the action takes place on the side 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.290
 opposite to where one thousand is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 but this happens very rarely 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.210
 regarding speed and dribbling 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.159
 we are at a good level but not the good 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.259
 true virtue behind is the ability with which 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.479
 manages to change direction by putting in 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.190
 difficulty the opposing defense 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.409
 the shot is good but it must be said that in front 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.630
 at the door not always infallible e 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.479
 I have often seen it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.890
 miss very easy goals 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.990
 however considering the price per 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 buy it ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.799
 credits I would say is a player who is there 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.119
 advice to buy without a shadow of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.400
 doubt the second player I want 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.470
 talk to you is salvatore bocchetti defender 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.570
 arrived at Milan 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.830
 recently and that has a value 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 overall of 75 unfortunately the merits of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.350
 nozzles are really few and yes 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 stop at head shots and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.580
 physicality that allows him to move 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.950
 the attackers the attacking opponents 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.290
 however, it will be enough to have a fast attacker 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.150
 and good at changing direction for 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 undermine this defender who 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.700
 he will not be able to resist in the least 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.429
 the attacker the speed of nozzles is 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.549
 practically nothing like the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 reactivity in making a contrast 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.489
 hardly loses position but his own 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.940
 slowness does not allow it to be 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.420
 incisive and make a difference 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.880
 inside the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.030
 defense this is therefore a player who 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.870
 I do not recommend it but in case you want to 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.459
 try 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 you can buy it at a great price 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.690
 very low, ranging from 500 to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.440
 1500 credits the last player who 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.489
 but I want to talk to you and doumbia 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.280
 striker arrived at the Rome that has a 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.860
 overall value of 82 doubt is a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.500
 fast player physically strong and with 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.670
 a great dribbling his speed i 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.550
 it allows to split the defense 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.110
 opponent and with her acceleration 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.769
 it allows to overturn the action in little 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.790
 time to stop it is really difficult 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.569
 considering the excellent capacity of 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 change direction very quickly 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.720
 as we have said for eto'o also 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.760
 even doumbia is always looking for the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.160
 depth and is always active during 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.350
 action also shooting is very good either 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.940
 up close that from a distance a player 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.110
 practically perfect for yours 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.640
 attack 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.890
 I also advise you to put it in 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.019
 pair with gervinho or ibarbo in that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.170
 to the same team and then theirs 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.680
 agreement will be perfect price unfortunately at 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.590
 moment is very high from 100 thousand credits 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.530
 up but how you reminded me too 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.680
 you among the comments in a while 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.720
 we will find at a lower price 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.730
 however, he is a player I recommend 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.140
 to buy without a shadow of a doubt a 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.390
 great player who can do the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.380
 unlike your attack and that there 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.030
 will guarantee many goals 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.799
