sometimes well what we're looking at is
the<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.850> skull<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> almost<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.840> a

the the skull is almost like a

the the skull is almost like a
membranous<00:01:31.530> bag<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> point<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.329> time

membranous bag at this point in time

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.929 
membranous bag at this point in time
that<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.140> sits<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.710> got<00:01:34.920> bony<00:01:35.189> stiffeners<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that it sits it's got bony stiffeners in

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
that it sits it's got bony stiffeners in
it<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> isn't<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> sort<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.200> alas<00:01:38.009> poor

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it but it isn't the sort of alas poor

Yorick<00:01:38.450> variety<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> skull<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.020> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
Yorick variety of skull that we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.889 
Yorick variety of skull that we
associate<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> skull<00:01:42.240> looks<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
associate with what a skull looks like

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
associate with what a skull looks like
so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:44.040> more<00:01:44.250> fluid<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so it's actually much more fluid and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.080 
so it's actually much more fluid and
much<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.450> membranous<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> apply

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
much more membranous so when you apply

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.350 
much more membranous so when you apply
of<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> volunteers<00:01:49.470> obviously

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
of on to the volunteers obviously

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
of on to the volunteers obviously
compresses<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> put<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> lot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.710> pressure

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
compresses and you put a lot of pressure

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.430 
compresses and you put a lot of pressure
onto<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.490> pull<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
onto them pull out and that can

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.520 
onto them pull out and that can
compress<00:01:57.010> some<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:58.320> structure<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.350> we

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
compress some of the structure that we

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.680 
compress some of the structure that we
call<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.800> tentorium<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.730> underneath<00:02:01.540> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
there a vascular sinuses so they can

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.780 
there a vascular sinuses so they can
actually<00:02:05.830> get<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.100> bit<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.370> headache

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
actually get a bit of a headache

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.640 
actually get a bit of a headache
from<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.600> compression<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.500> that
