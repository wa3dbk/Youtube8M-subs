00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
of course no one can see it what

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.079 
of course no one can see it what
happened<00:00:04.589> was<00:00:04.710> when<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> would<00:00:05.790> turn<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
happened was when I would turn the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.890 
happened was when I would turn the
headlights<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.740> over<00:00:07.740> here<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.450> the<00:00:09.450> wand<00:00:09.690> over

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
headlights on over here on the wand over

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.650 
headlights on over here on the wand over
here<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.679> would<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.580> would<00:00:11.639> turn<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.179> video

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
here it would it would turn this video

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
here it would it would turn this video
for<00:00:13.080> return<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.530> blue<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.099> say<00:00:14.509> camera<00:00:15.680> rear

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
for return this blue and say camera rear

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.620 
for return this blue and say camera rear
view<00:00:16.890> camera<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.910> would<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.300> then<00:00:18.449> would

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
view camera and it would and then would

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.500 
view camera and it would and then would
you<00:00:18.660> couldn't<00:00:19.439> control<00:00:19.529> anything<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.510> called

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
you couldn't control anything so called

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.590 
you couldn't control anything so called
boss<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.369> there's<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:23.490> orange<00:00:23.880> cable<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
boss and there's an orange cable on the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.720 
boss and there's an orange cable on the
back<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.680> labeled<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> read<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
back and it's labeled you can read this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
back and it's labeled you can read this
can<00:00:29.730> probably<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.750> labeled<00:00:31.170> camera

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
can probably but it's labeled camera

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
can probably but it's labeled camera
rear<00:00:32.340> view<00:00:32.550> camera<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> don't<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> camera

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
rear view camera I don't have a camera

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.770 
rear view camera I don't have a camera
hooked<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> disconnect<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hooked up so I had to disconnect it and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.799 
hooked up so I had to disconnect it and
then<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.010> tape<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> off<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> now<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.600> works

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
then I just tape it off and now it works

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
then I just tape it off and now it works
fine<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> same<00:00:41.070> problem

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
fine so if you have that same problem

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
fine so if you have that same problem
with<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.480> car<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> turn<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
with the your car when you turn the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
with the your car when you turn the
headlights<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> camera<00:00:45.030> mode

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
headlights on going to a camera mode

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
headlights on going to a camera mode
then<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:47.039> orange<00:00:47.370> cable<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
then you know that that orange cable the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
then you know that that orange cable the
camera<00:00:48.090> mode<00:00:48.270> needs<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.750> pulled<00:00:48.960> off

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
camera mode needs to be pulled off

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.250 
camera mode needs to be pulled off
because<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.520> reason<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> wire<00:00:52.079> harness

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because for some reason the wire harness

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.220 
because for some reason the wire harness
right<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> orange<00:00:53.219> cable<00:00:53.610> ties<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
right here the orange cable ties into in

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.750 
right here the orange cable ties into in
my<00:00:55.410> case<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> purple<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:58.760> edges

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
my case this is the purple and the edges

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.119 
my case this is the purple and the edges
purple<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.840> wiring<00:01:01.109> diagram<00:01:01.680> but

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
purple which is on my wiring diagram but

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
purple which is on my wiring diagram but
a<00:01:02.160> Subaru<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:04.070> illumination<00:01:05.070> wire<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.909> for

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
a Subaru is the illumination wire so for

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.730 
a Subaru is the illumination wire so for
some<00:01:06.689> reason<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:08.310> pin<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.600> mum<00:01:09.900> metra

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
some reason that pin on that mum metra

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
some reason that pin on that mum metra
system<00:01:11.670> hooks<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> illumination<00:01:13.200> wire

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
system hooks up to the illumination wire

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310 
system hooks up to the illumination wire
so<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> incorrect<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.420> probably<00:01:16.170> needs

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so which is incorrect it probably needs

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
so which is incorrect it probably needs
to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.590> flipped<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.130> needs<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.610> whoever

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to be flipped it needs to be whoever

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.480 
to be flipped it needs to be whoever
instance<00:01:18.659> install<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:20.040> needs<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> be

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
instance install this this needs to be

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
instance install this this needs to be
here<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.540> there's<00:01:21.659> another<00:01:21.869> orange<00:01:22.170> wire

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here because there's another orange wire

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
here because there's another orange wire
here<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.850> where<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
here and that's the that's where the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.469 
here and that's the that's where the
camera<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.280> but<00:01:26.280> anyway<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> turn<00:01:27.360> your

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
camera so but anyway if you turn your

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.969 
camera so but anyway if you turn your
headlights<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.470> any<00:01:28.650> video

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
headlights and you don't get any video

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.640 
headlights and you don't get any video
and<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.250> turns<00:01:29.720> maybe<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> show<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and it turns maybe I can show you it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:52.700 
and it turns maybe I can show you it
turns<00:01:31.950> blue<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.670> try<00:01:32.790> real<00:01:33.060> quick

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.120 

okay<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:53.860> if<00:01:54.010> i<00:01:54.100> do<00:01:54.160> this<00:01:54.460> i<00:01:55.650> touch<00:01:56.650> these<00:01:56.920> two

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
okay so if i do this i touch these two

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.340 
okay so if i do this i touch these two
together<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.950> says<00:02:00.570> camera<00:02:01.570> no

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
together see that that says camera no

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.070 
together see that that says camera no
video<00:02:02.740> signal<00:02:03.190> when<00:02:04.030> i<00:02:04.060> pull<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.450> apart<00:02:04.540> it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
video signal when i pull that apart it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.930 
video signal when i pull that apart it
works<00:02:05.230> fine<00:02:05.530> same<00:02:06.430> thing<00:02:06.580> with<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> radio

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
works fine same thing with the radio

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
works fine same thing with the radio
watch<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.580> you'll<00:02:15.700> enter<00:02:15.880> erratic<00:02:16.240> all

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
watch this and you'll enter erratic all

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.560 
watch this and you'll enter erratic all
have<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.320> take<00:02:17.470> tylenol<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:19.330> that's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
have to do is take tylenol and that's

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.150 
have to do is take tylenol and that's
the<00:02:19.660> thing<00:02:19.750> i'm<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> lexapro<00:02:20.650> we'll<00:02:21.070> see

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the thing i'm on the lexapro we'll see

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040 
the thing i'm on the lexapro we'll see
how<00:02:21.190> much<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.880> take<00:02:22.300> also<00:02:22.900> i<00:02:22.930> know

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050
