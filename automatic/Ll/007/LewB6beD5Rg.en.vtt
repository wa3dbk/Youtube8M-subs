00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.230
 andreas on this motorcycle as well 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.330
 special parts do not equal one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.730
 everything stands out but this rim is one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 madness as it has been produced 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 So the rims arise with us 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 have own cnc machines we have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 also has its own cad design development 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.609
 and own programming that is from 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 the idea of putting a stop to the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.180
 implementation until the finished product 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 everything happens in our house 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.160
 Designate first and then go 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 from it with a camp program the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 machine commands written and derived from it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.870
 This wheel was created on your track 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 in fact times such a big one 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.780
 aluminum block and is almost one 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 whole week in such a machine and what 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 for forms are possible because it is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 Fantasy is the fantasy 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 just set the limits 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 dimension of the mature so proceed 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 Actually only on the cot there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 you have to go somewhere with a design 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 connect and of course somehow 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 again to guess but everything else 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 is open space coming 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 Well, well, I will not say it now 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 wonder that your world champion up 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.619
 customizing side yes well i do yes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.259
 but we got a lot of developed 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 years and we are 14 good ten years 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.369
 started to produce their own parts 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 have cnc machines bought today 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.530
 the latest technology you like 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
 also applies in prototype construction and thus 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 Of course you have a lot more 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.290
 possibilities than most others 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.790
 now I'm only interested in 1 like 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.540
 looks the future you already have 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.850
 Any ideas in the quiver we have 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.200
 next year 30 years weird and me 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 think something special for us 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.190
 field at the are already there has become 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.690
 Really implement that you have to 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.039
 see 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.440
 Some people also die in development 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.610
 because it is too elaborate or maybe 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.039
 but not so nice if you look 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.830
 will find next will take place 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.090
 year, we will meet here and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.590
 see if we did it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.000
 it is the next world champion 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.000
 title in the bag probably
