one of the only fat bikes that I've seen
that<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.700> has<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> mid<00:00:15.269> drive<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.260> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that actually has a mid drive I think I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.109 
that actually has a mid drive I think I
saw<00:00:16.500> maybe<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.220> felt<00:00:17.609> bike<00:00:17.820> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
saw maybe it was like a felt bike that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.220 
saw maybe it was like a felt bike that
was<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> prototype<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.990> interbike<00:00:19.369> in<00:00:20.369> 2014

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
was a prototype at interbike in 2014

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
was a prototype at interbike in 2014
actually<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.380> 2013<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.150> may<00:00:24.330> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
actually that was 2013 so we may see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.599 
actually that was 2013 so we may see
some<00:00:24.570> stuff<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> challenge<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
some stuff but the challenge is that you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.759 
some stuff but the challenge is that you
see<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:26.910> wide<00:00:27.180> those<00:00:27.599> chainstays<00:00:28.199> are<00:00:28.410> right

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
see how wide those chainstays are right

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
see how wide those chainstays are right
here<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.189> need<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.670> wide<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
here they need to be wide so that you

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
here they need to be wide so that you
can<00:00:30.990> fit<00:00:31.170> these<00:00:31.320> huge<00:00:31.679> tires<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.820> huge<00:00:33.030> tires

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
style of bike the challenge is getting a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
style of bike the challenge is getting a
mid<00:00:40.649> drive<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.520> fit<00:00:42.000> here

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
mid drive that will actually fit here

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
mid drive that will actually fit here
right<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> eight<00:00:43.890> fun<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> ball<00:00:44.579> Fang

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
right like the eight fun the ball Fang

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
right like the eight fun the ball Fang
ones<00:00:45.059> they<00:00:45.270> don't<00:00:45.510> fit<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.770> aren't

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
ones they don't fit they they aren't

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
ones they don't fit they they aren't
wide<00:00:47.100> enough<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.870> know

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
wide enough so a lot of people you know

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
wide enough so a lot of people you know
use<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> bionics<00:00:49.920> d<00:00:50.129> series<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.789> something

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
use like a bionics d series or something

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.180 
use like a bionics d series or something
like<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.680> hub<00:00:53.039> motor

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
like that but then that's a hub motor

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
like that but then that's a hub motor
you<00:00:53.399> don't<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.059> climbing

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you don't get the same climbing

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
you don't get the same climbing
advantage<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> efficiency<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.280> mid<00:00:56.460> drive

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
advantage the efficiency of a mid drive

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
advantage the efficiency of a mid drive
also<00:00:56.940> wait<00:00:57.690> ends<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.350> being<00:00:58.500> located<00:00:58.829> towards

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
also wait ends up being located towards

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
also wait ends up being located towards
the rear<00:00:59.520> something<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.750> everything

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the rear something like this everything

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
the rear something like this everything
is<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> lowest

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is right there this is like the lowest

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
is right there this is like the lowest
most<00:01:03.750> centrally<00:01:04.199> balance<00:01:04.500> kit<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
most centrally balance kit you can get I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
most centrally balance kit you can get I
guess<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> isn't<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> kit<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
guess it isn't a kit this would be like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
guess it isn't a kit this would be like
a<00:01:07.770> fully<00:01:08.580> built<00:01:08.850> bike<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:10.080> Jim<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.610> it

on<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.380> ride<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.950> uploaded<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> cloud<00:01:47.700> so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
on your ride is uploaded to the cloud so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899 
on your ride is uploaded to the cloud so
we<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.590> battery<00:01:49.950> cycles<00:01:50.460> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
we can see the battery cycles and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.789 
we can see the battery cycles and
anything<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> happened<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.170> many<00:01:52.439> faults

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
anything that happened with many faults

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.270 
anything that happened with many faults
in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> batteries<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> makes<00:01:54.030> for

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
in the batteries and it makes for

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.850 
in the batteries and it makes for
really<00:01:54.460> easy<00:01:54.700> diagnosing<00:01:55.600> okay<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.440> that<00:01:56.710> was

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
really easy diagnosing okay and that was

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980 
really easy diagnosing okay and that was
one<00:01:57.010> of<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.130> big<00:01:57.400> okay<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.390> first<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.930> all

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
one of the big okay so first of all

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.260 
one of the big okay so first of all
motor<00:01:59.619> battery<00:02:00.040> controller<00:02:00.610> all<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:01.119> that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
motor battery controller all in that

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.120 
motor battery controller all in that
bottom<00:02:01.600> bracket<00:02:01.930> right<00:02:02.020> there<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.380> they've

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
bottom bracket right there and they've

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.219 
bottom bracket right there and they've
got<00:02:03.340> software<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.299> can<00:02:04.479> actually<00:02:04.659> make<00:02:05.080> sure

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
got software that can actually make sure

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.410 
got software that can actually make sure
this<00:02:05.409> thing<00:02:05.619> doesn't<00:02:05.970> overcharge<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.240> that's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
this thing doesn't overcharge and that's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.570 
this thing doesn't overcharge and that's
going<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.780> extend<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.800> life<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
going to extend the life of it and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.850 
going to extend the life of it and
they're<00:02:09.700> also<00:02:09.850> setting<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.840> up<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.560> cuts

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
they're also setting it up so it cuts

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.440 
they're also setting it up so it cuts
off<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:12.790> was<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.000> after<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> couple

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
off like what was it after a couple

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.760 
off like what was it after a couple
months<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:13.930> something<00:02:14.140> it'll<00:02:14.410> completely

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
months or something it'll completely

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.500 
months or something it'll completely
shut<00:02:15.040> off<00:02:15.069> yeah<00:02:15.400> if<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> battery<00:02:16.120> ever<00:02:16.270> gets

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
shut off yeah if the battery ever gets

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.540 
shut off yeah if the battery ever gets
to<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> certain<00:02:16.750> level<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.590> BMS<00:02:17.980> automatically

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
to a certain level the BMS automatically

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.820 
to a certain level the BMS automatically
shuts<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.940> off<00:02:19.060> completely<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.440> won't<00:02:20.620> hurt

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
shuts it off completely so it won't hurt

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.979 
shuts it off completely so it won't hurt
the<00:02:21.010> cells<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.390> doesn't<00:02:22.540> completely

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
the cells right so it doesn't completely

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.660 
the cells right so it doesn't completely
drain<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:23.680> when<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.920> come<00:02:24.130> back<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
drain and then when you come back and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.370 
drain and then when you come back and
charge<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> they'll<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.540> flying<00:02:25.750> after<00:02:26.080> one

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
charge it they'll be flying after one

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.710 
charge it they'll be flying after one
cycle<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:27.040> love<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.550> that's<00:02:28.120> awesome<00:02:28.570> and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
cycle I love that that's awesome and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.530

crash going down this Thanks you know
it's<00:03:50.859> fairly<00:03:51.130> I'm<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.940> pedaling<00:03:52.390> right<00:03:52.570> now

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
it's fairly I'm just pedaling right now

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.030 
it's fairly I'm just pedaling right now
it's<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:54.130> know<00:03:54.160> there's<00:03:54.820> more<00:03:56.040> resistance

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
it's you know there's more resistance

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.970 
it's you know there's more resistance
when<00:03:57.250> pedaling<00:03:57.700> because<00:03:57.910> there's<00:03:58.120> more

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
when pedaling because there's more

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.710 
when pedaling because there's more
surface<00:03:59.980> area<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.609> tires<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.390> wheels

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
surface area on the tires and the wheels

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.540 
surface area on the tires and the wheels
are<00:04:02.019> big<00:04:02.260> which<00:04:02.560> means<00:04:02.800> it<00:04:02.920> takes<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.280> minute<00:04:03.519> to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
are big which means it takes a minute to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.580 
are big which means it takes a minute to
get<00:04:03.760> them<00:04:03.879> up<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.030> speed<00:04:04.300> but<00:04:04.659> once<00:04:05.230> you're

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
get them up to speed but once you're

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.649 
get them up to speed but once you're
there<00:04:06.060> keeps<00:04:07.060> going<00:04:07.269> all<00:04:07.569> right<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:13.450> I'll<00:04:13.569> go
