after but to do that the most important
thing<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.439> must<00:01:25.619> understand<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
thing is is that we must understand that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
thing is is that we must understand that
there<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.759> nature<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> our<00:01:27.780> reality<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there is a nature of our reality it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
there is a nature of our reality it's
not<00:01:28.590> subjective<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.850> willy<00:01:30.150> nilly<00:01:30.240> it's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
not subjective it's not willy nilly it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.870 
not subjective it's not willy nilly it's
not<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.560> somebody<00:01:31.950> else<00:01:32.250> has<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> say<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
not that that somebody else has a say in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.460 
not that that somebody else has a say in
these<00:01:33.030> things<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.049> step<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
these things and the first step in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.660 
these things and the first step in
understanding<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.040> nature<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.340> our<00:01:35.520> reality

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
understanding the nature of our reality

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
understanding the nature of our reality
is<00:01:36.060> understanding<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.990> principle<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
is understanding that this principle is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.359 
is understanding that this principle is
is<00:01:38.729> absolute<00:01:39.540> law<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> understand

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
is absolute law and when you understand

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
is absolute law and when you understand
that<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.390> through<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> principle

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that and you see through the principle

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
that and you see through the principle
of<00:01:43.530> thoughts<00:01:43.740> becoming<00:01:44.070> things<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of thoughts becoming things that we have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
of thoughts becoming things that we have
a<00:01:45.030> choice<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> thoughts<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.619> think

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
a choice and the thoughts that we think

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.090 
walls closing around me and remind me of
the<00:03:30.300> truth<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.590> used<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.830> do<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.040> for

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
the truth and I used to do this for

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
the truth and I used to do this for
myself<00:03:32.520> through<00:03:33.209> my<00:03:33.390> outlook<00:03:33.930> Microsoft

myself through my outlook Microsoft

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.449 
myself through my outlook Microsoft
Outlook<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.950> would<00:03:35.070> have<00:03:35.190> an<00:03:35.280> appointment

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
Outlook I would have an appointment

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.430 
Outlook I would have an appointment
every<00:03:35.790> day<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.030> would<00:03:36.120> remind<00:03:36.360> me<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.810> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
every day that would remind me that this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.350 
every day that would remind me that this
is<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> dream<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.730> dream<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.239> you're

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
is a dream it's your dream and you're

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.750 
is a dream it's your dream and you're
the<00:03:39.480> Dream<00:03:39.720> Weaver<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.380> would<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.760> great

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the Dream Weaver and that would be great

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.860 
the Dream Weaver and that would be great
you<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.300> was<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> same<00:03:42.630> message

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
you know but it was the same message

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.630 
you know but it was the same message
every<00:03:43.200> day<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> thought<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:43.830> if<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.400> was<00:03:44.610> a

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
every day and I thought if if this was a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.400 
every day and I thought if if this was a
personalized<00:03:45.330> email<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.110> was<00:03:46.200> different

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
personalized email and it was different

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.100 
personalized email and it was different
every<00:03:46.769> single<00:03:46.800> day<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.580> hence<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> idea<00:03:48.930> for

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
every single day and hence the idea for

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.140 
every single day and hence the idea for
sending<00:03:49.530> out<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:50.100> daily<00:03:50.700> note<00:03:50.880> from<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
sending out a daily note from the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
sending out a daily note from the
universe<00:03:51.600> at<00:03:52.050> which<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.410> beginning<00:03:52.830> was

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
universe at which in the beginning was

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.430 
universe at which in the beginning was
called<00:03:53.310> silver<00:03:53.850> bullets<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.930> wisely

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
called silver bullets not a wisely

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.979 
called silver bullets not a wisely
chosen<00:03:55.709> name<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.250> was<00:03:56.340> designed<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.090> be

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
chosen name it was designed to be

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.860 
chosen name it was designed to be
evocative<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.310> message<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.269> would<00:04:00.360> pierce

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
evocative of a message that would pierce

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.600 
evocative of a message that would pierce
through<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> illusions<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.010> remind<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.489> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
through the illusions and remind you of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.120 
through the illusions and remind you of
truth<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.570> as<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.720> wrote<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.470> silver<00:04:04.800> bullets

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
truth but as I wrote the silver bullets

us<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.750> something<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.170> think

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
us and this is something that I think

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.400 
us and this is something that I think
about<00:05:37.530> it's<00:05:38.340> like<00:05:38.490> sometimes<00:05:38.670> we<00:05:38.940> say<00:05:39.330> things

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
about it's like sometimes we say things

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.260 
about it's like sometimes we say things
off-the-cuff<00:05:40.410> or<00:05:40.920> maybe<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.880> know<00:05:42.000> we<00:05:42.150> have<00:05:42.240> a

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
off-the-cuff or maybe you know we have a

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.330 
off-the-cuff or maybe you know we have a
self-depreciating<00:05:43.110> type<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.950> know<00:05:43.980> sense

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
self-depreciating type of you know sense

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.370 
self-depreciating type of you know sense
of<00:05:44.520> humor<00:05:44.820> or<00:05:45.180> maybe<00:05:45.420> we're<00:05:45.660> singing<00:05:45.990> along<00:05:46.230> in

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
of humor or maybe we're singing along in

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.020
