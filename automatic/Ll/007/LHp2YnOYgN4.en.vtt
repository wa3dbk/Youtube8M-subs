00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
see it will find its way to sort of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
see it will find its way to sort of
moving<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.310> kinda<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> sort<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> nice

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
heating it we're going to give it a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.270 
heating it we're going to give it a
little<00:02:19.140> stir<00:02:19.319> until<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> sugar<00:02:19.799> is<00:02:20.069> all

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
little stir until the sugar is all

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.130 
little stir until the sugar is all
dissolved<00:02:20.579> then<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.150> give<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.329> huge<00:02:21.629> blast<00:02:21.930> of

dissolved then you give a huge blast of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.660 
dissolved then you give a huge blast of
heat<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.530> 5<00:02:22.650> minutes<00:02:22.890> anything<00:02:23.549> you've<00:02:23.640> got
