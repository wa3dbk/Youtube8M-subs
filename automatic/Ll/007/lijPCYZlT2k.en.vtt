double-check yourself always
double-check<00:00:19.770> yourself<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> lot<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
double-check yourself because a lot of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
double-check yourself because a lot of
times<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.510> boxes<00:00:22.020> aren't<00:00:22.170> marked<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.920> or

electricity these will hurt you if you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
electricity these will hurt you if you
don't<00:00:28.439> check<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> double-check<00:00:29.490> yourself<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
don't check and double-check yourself so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.430 
don't check and double-check yourself so
what<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.149> our<00:00:33.180> power<00:00:33.540> off<00:00:33.960> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
what we do we have our power off so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.000 
what we do we have our power off so
we're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.890> ahead<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> open<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:37.010> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we're going to go ahead and open up the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:53.810 
we're going to go ahead and open up the
cover<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:49.670> get<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:52.100> little<00:00:53.100> mechanical

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
cover and get into our little mechanical

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
cover and get into our little mechanical
room<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> our<00:00:54.300> water<00:00:54.510> heater<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.649> next

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
room on our water heater here the next

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.619 
room on our water heater here the next
thing<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.219> looking<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.879> power<00:00:57.149> there's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
thing we're looking for is power there's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
thing we're looking for is power there's
two<00:00:57.780> places<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> check<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
two places that I check for this on a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
two places that I check for this on a
water<00:00:59.430> heater<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> first<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.930> here

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
water heater the first one is down here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
water heater the first one is down here
at<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> element<00:01:02.010> typically<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> power<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
at the element typically if the power is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
at the element typically if the power is
on<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.049> towards<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.650> element

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
on it's going to be towards this element

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950 
on it's going to be towards this element
but<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.909> also<00:01:06.060> another<00:01:06.360> place<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> check

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but there's also another place I check

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.030 
but there's also another place I check
before<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> call<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> good

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
before I call it good

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
before I call it good
now<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.270> no<00:01:09.420> voltage

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
now you can see that there's no voltage

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
now you can see that there's no voltage
at<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.560> element<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.729> next<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
at this element here the next one is a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750 
at this element here the next one is a
little<00:01:12.659> trickier<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.340> check<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
little trickier to get in to check I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
little trickier to get in to check I
always<00:01:15.000> reach<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> top<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
always reach up at the top here in the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
always reach up at the top here in the
top<00:01:17.070> corner<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> plastic<00:01:18.420> itself<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
top corner just the plastic itself and I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
top corner just the plastic itself and I
pull<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> plastic<00:01:20.280> thing<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:21.420> worry

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pull this plastic thing off don't worry

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.370 
pull this plastic thing off don't worry
it<00:01:21.780> snaps<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> next<00:01:25.049> thing<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it snaps right back on the next thing I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
it snaps right back on the next thing I
do<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.740> check<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.610> power<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> top

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
do is check up here for power at the top

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
do is check up here for power at the top
two<00:01:27.750> screws<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.650> power<00:01:28.860> here

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
two screws because there's power here

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
two screws because there's power here
all<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.700> regardless<00:01:30.390> sometimes<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
all the time regardless sometimes the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
all the time regardless sometimes the
power<00:01:31.680> transfers<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> lower<00:01:32.759> element<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
power transfers to the lower element and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999 
power transfers to the lower element and
that's<00:01:33.450> why<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> say<00:01:33.960> check<00:01:34.229> both<00:01:34.409> spots<00:01:34.770> if

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's why I say check both spots if

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
that's why I say check both spots if
you're<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.430> cover<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.299> easy<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you're in one cover it's just as easy to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
you're in one cover it's just as easy to
pull<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.290> off<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> check<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> top<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pull this off and check the top if you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
pull this off and check the top if you
want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> start<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.180> you'll<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.810> sure

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
want to start there you'll know for sure

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.039 
want to start there you'll know for sure
right<00:01:40.020> away<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:42.150> I've<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.600> no<00:01:42.810> power

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
right away you can see I've got no power

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
right away you can see I've got no power
at<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.829> unit<00:01:44.130> period<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.939> we're<00:01:45.119> safe<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> go

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
at the unit period so we're safe to go

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139

ahead and and work with this now the
thermostat<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.380> two

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
thermostat in these there's two

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
thermostat in these there's two
thermostats<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.520> electric<00:01:50.970> water<00:01:51.090> heater

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
thermostats and an electric water heater

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.270 
thermostats and an electric water heater
there's<00:01:51.659> an<00:01:51.780> upper<00:01:52.049> thermostat<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
there's an upper thermostat and there is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.389 
there's an upper thermostat and there is
a<00:01:53.310> lower<00:01:53.579> thermostat<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.380> ask<00:01:55.890> why<00:01:56.159> there's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
a lower thermostat you ask why there's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.389 
a lower thermostat you ask why there's
two<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.030> reason<00:01:57.420> being<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.979> once<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
two the reason being is once you get the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
two the reason being is once you get the
water<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> certain<00:02:00.240> temperature<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.810> here

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
for that first hour recovery you it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
for that first hour recovery you it
switches<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.649> bottom<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> go<00:02:05.219> ahead<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
switches to the bottom to go ahead and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
switches to the bottom to go ahead and
finish<00:02:05.700> heating<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> rest<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> tank<00:02:06.899> now

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
finish heating the rest of the tank now

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
finish heating the rest of the tank now

temperature<00:02:17.739> stacking<00:02:18.310> which<00:02:18.969> is<00:02:19.150> pretty

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
temperature stacking which is pretty

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.390 
temperature stacking which is pretty
simple<00:02:19.689> if<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.019> think<00:02:20.230> about<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.650> heat<00:02:20.859> rises

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
simple if you think about it heat rises

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.250 
simple if you think about it heat rises
it<00:02:21.609> does<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.939> same<00:02:22.120> thing<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.540> hot<00:02:22.719> water<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
it does the same thing in hot water and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.670 
it does the same thing in hot water and
in<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.439> tank<00:02:23.709> itself<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.459> your<00:02:25.000> top<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.680> going

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
in the tank itself so your top is going

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.410 
in the tank itself so your top is going
to<00:02:26.739> be<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.340> bit<00:02:27.489> hotter<00:02:27.819> than<00:02:28.209> your

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to be a little bit hotter than your

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.479 
to be a little bit hotter than your
bottom<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.409> don't<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:30.069> turn<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
bottom so that they don't all turn it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.550 
bottom so that they don't all turn it
wrong<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.629> something<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> lot<00:02:32.319> of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
wrong it's something that a lot of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960 
wrong it's something that a lot of
people<00:02:32.829> don't<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.189> about<00:02:33.459> that's<00:02:33.670> pretty

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
people don't know about that's pretty

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.149 
people don't know about that's pretty
important<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.170> your<00:02:35.290> lower<00:02:35.530> element<00:02:36.040> is

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
important so your lower element is

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.860 
important so your lower element is
usually<00:02:36.459> one<00:02:36.670> setting<00:02:37.060> lower<00:02:37.269> than<00:02:37.720> your

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
usually one setting lower than your

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.390 
usually one setting lower than your
upper<00:02:38.109> element<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:38.709> each<00:02:38.859> setting<00:02:39.250> on

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
upper element because each setting on

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.059 
upper element because each setting on
these<00:02:39.609> is<00:02:39.819> about<00:02:40.090> 10<00:02:40.329> degrees<00:02:40.799> now<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.859> get

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
these is about 10 degrees now we get

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.429 
these is about 10 degrees now we get
into<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.549> thermostat<00:02:43.450> itself<00:02:43.870> each<00:02:44.049> one's<00:02:44.319> a

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
into the thermostat itself each one's a

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.809 
into the thermostat itself each one's a
little<00:02:44.680> bit<00:02:44.799> different<00:02:45.189> some<00:02:45.639> of<00:02:45.670> these

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
little bit different some of these

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.610 
little bit different some of these
thermostats<00:02:46.389> have<00:02:46.689> numbers<00:02:47.109> on<00:02:47.230> them<00:02:47.409> and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
thermostats have numbers on them and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.009 
thermostats have numbers on them and
some<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:48.010> them<00:02:48.129> have<00:02:48.310> letters<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.939> them<00:02:49.090> this

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
some of them have letters on them this

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.379 
some of them have letters on them this
one<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.500> particular<00:02:50.620> has<00:02:51.040> numbers<00:02:51.909> on<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.299> and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
one in particular has numbers on it and

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.460 
one in particular has numbers on it and
as<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.439> see<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.790> goes<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.450> 150<00:02:56.169> degrees

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470

something<00:03:24.159> that<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.400> use<00:03:24.760> every<00:03:24.790> day<00:03:25.180> a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389

until<00:03:27.190> your<00:03:27.459> water<00:03:27.639> heater<00:03:27.909> goes<00:03:28.180> out<00:03:28.419> or<00:03:28.690> goes

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
until your water heater goes out or goes

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.689 
until your water heater goes out or goes
bad<00:03:29.109> but<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:29.889> something<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.459> need<00:03:30.609> to

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
bad but it's something that we need to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:31.949 
bad but it's something that we need to
pay<00:03:30.819> attention<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.269> temperature-wise

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
pay attention to temperature-wise

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.390 
pay attention to temperature-wise
because<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.590> can<00:03:32.739> be<00:03:32.889> very<00:03:33.099> potentially

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
because it can be very potentially

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.789 
because it can be very potentially
dangerous<00:03:33.900> okay<00:03:34.900> now<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.109> change<00:03:35.590> the

makes your water heater very very
efficient

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
efficient

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.610

that's<00:04:23.820> how<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.120> adjust<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.840> thermostat<00:04:25.050> on

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
that's how you adjust the thermostat on

that's how you adjust the thermostat on
this<00:04:25.890> now<00:04:26.100> there's<00:04:26.310> also<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.670> redundant
