difficult<00:01:06.369> but<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.670> unit's<00:01:08.030> got<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.509> sturdy

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
difficult but the unit's got that sturdy

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.870 
difficult but the unit's got that sturdy
design<00:01:09.259> that<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:09.920> try<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.220> build<00:01:10.520> into

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
design that we try to build into

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.380 
design that we try to build into
everything<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.780> do<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:13.430> as<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:14.000> can<00:01:14.180> see

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
everything that we do so as you can see

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.719 
everything that we do so as you can see
really<00:01:15.290> takes<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.740> lot<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:16.070> force<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.369> shake

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
really takes a lot of force to shake

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.050 
really takes a lot of force to shake
that<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.119> really<00:01:17.540> really<00:01:17.840> solid<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.850> this

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
that it's really really solid so this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.230 
that it's really really solid so this
unit<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.540> used<00:01:20.900> obviously<00:01:21.290> for<00:01:21.950> single<00:01:22.850> legged

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.650 

from<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> side

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.800 

just<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.440> regular<00:02:19.600> step<00:02:20.600> like<00:02:20.870> that

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.710
