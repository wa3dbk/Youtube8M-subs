 franz joseph haydn and cervantes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 I also think they are 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.229
 necessary because 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.410
 and is that this type of conference 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.950
 offer answers to a basic question that is how we can use 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.760

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.350
 it's how we can but all this series of learning opportunities 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 formed by tools for resources by people 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 is to use them in improving the quality of teaching both 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.240
 face-to-face as semi-face-to-face as a distance 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.180
 they want an aspect that interests me a lot that is how we can use them 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 in professional or teacher development throughout life 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.270
 after the technologies open us the series of tremendous perspectives however not 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.550
 It is Jewish how you are used 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.290
 Having contact with people who have more experience investigating 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.650
 people from other countries that have percent before the different ones can be us 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.660
 repaired to get ideas and to improve our teaching practice by point the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.659
 price is absolutely necessary this type of conference 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.190
 efe 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.960
 well while I was unconscious 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 recently passed the strike in prisons I accepted 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.020
 my impression is absolutely positive of what I am delighted 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.900
 the one that has recognized one of the most intelligent groups of people and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.330
 interesting percent of my life 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.680
 I'm sure I'm sure that the performance will continue 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.470
 is the structure of the conference has been orchestrated very little integration 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.860
 mentioned which helped a lot to exchange the communication 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.320
 it's not a comparison to just go bow or listen but 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.569
 everyone has opportunity for him expressed his opinion and to interact 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.629
 then the help of dudko parallel to the conference the accessibility of all the 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.139
 people who have come is fantastic so the corridors 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.799
 and the entities or from outside the company has been 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.699
 magnificent I think it's a text is a model that many of the many of 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.829
 those present will copy things when we had colonized our 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.829
 institutions because it really works really well 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.709
 did not specify Valencia agencies 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.169
 before it was negative shore jersey experience when the king 14 alcoholism 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.099
 inside agents 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.549
 nacho lezcano 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.029
 - 19 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.919
 We ask at all levels for certain science who you would choose 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.099
 the statement of the sr 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.009
 the country 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.959
 olsen 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.400
 they tell of exposing it sanchez pandemias this week 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.879
 if it's been a bit strange because it's also ismaelillo errors that 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.729
 we did something together 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.049
 certainly we have prepared but we had not tried and we did not know how 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.769
 would react the audience of 2002 audience types different points in 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.019
 simultaneous teapot 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.309
 the great part to interactivity all the merit must be said from the 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.909
 prism the simple hand to the foot voting and so on I was a little 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.979
 skeptical that that causes participation 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.939
 but we have realized that people were people who do not speak 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.549
 Question 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.499
 percent have been able to express themselves in a way by voting 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.989
 true that the alternatives were a bit 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.039
 how those were not dichotomous 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.179
 and you had to take sides for one thing or another and without nuances 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.019
 but no I do not adore in the end only have been satisfied 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.549
 and when I talked to people the post had been more more satisfied not 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.089
 what do you like the people inside of the one cited by the idea of ​​how are we going 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.919
 accomplished 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.039
 and the truth is that the hair that being able to a little buoy use it to use more 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.249
 these formats 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.039
 p the mosqueo of the audience place sit passively participated in way 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.769
 active 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.359
 expressing your opinions 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.090
 on the other hand I was worried that the audience that had production 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.989
 simultaneous 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.139
 ee 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.430
 its lost by production 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.580
 the one that by the way I have been told has been magnificent was missing some nuances or that 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.680
 they did not understand our initiative little that they did not participate little no game but 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.750
 has been the opposite I think that the English-speaking audience has 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.210
 been the one that has participated the most and the one that has most entered the game has 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.309
 proposed city 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.110
 in theory very happy I hope that people also been 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.020
 happy and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.330
 I can participate and learn things and was fine-tuned 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.309
