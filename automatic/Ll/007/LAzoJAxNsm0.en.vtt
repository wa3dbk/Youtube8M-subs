and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> closure<00:00:55.170> behind<00:00:55.499> me<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:56.039> started<00:00:56.190> off

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
and the closure behind me we started off

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.099 
and the closure behind me we started off
by<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.550> researching<00:00:57.120> our<00:00:57.359> animals<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.019> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
by just researching our animals to get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
by just researching our animals to get
kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> better<00:00:58.559> idea<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.460> behaviors

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
kind of a better idea for what behaviors

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.399 
kind of a better idea for what behaviors
we<00:00:59.999> want<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.420> seeing<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.870> their<00:01:01.019> enclosures

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
we want to be seeing in their enclosures

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.799 
we want to be seeing in their enclosures
after<00:01:02.339> that<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.670> started<00:01:02.909> prototyping<00:01:03.149> we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
after that we started prototyping we

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.939 
after that we started prototyping we
were<00:01:03.899> thinking<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.440> different<00:01:04.680> designs

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
were thinking of different designs

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
were thinking of different designs
things<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.550> could<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.330> enrich

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
things that we could do to really enrich

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
things that we could do to really enrich
these<00:01:07.110> animals<00:01:07.440> lives<00:01:07.620> we<00:01:08.190> came<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
these animals lives we came back and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
these animals lives we came back and
presented<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.510> initial<00:01:10.470> designs<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
presented our initial designs to the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
presented our initial designs to the
curators<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.570> zoo<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.410> some

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
curators here at the zoo and we got some

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.960 
curators here at the zoo and we got some
feedback<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.460> spent<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
feedback and then we spent some more

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
feedback and then we spent some more
time<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.720> fix<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:16.020> our<00:01:16.140> designs<00:01:16.410> make

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
time to kind of fix up our designs make

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.040 
time to kind of fix up our designs make
it<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:16.980> sturdy<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:18.540> improve<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
it more sturdy and just improve it to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.350 
it more sturdy and just improve it to
the<00:01:19.140> curators<00:01:19.620> expectations<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.970> day<00:01:21.120> since

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the curators expectations the day since

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.250 
the curators expectations the day since
we've<00:01:21.570> been<00:01:21.660> observing<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> animals

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
we've been observing the animals

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410 
we've been observing the animals
charting<00:01:23.190> data<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.730> making<00:01:23.910> sure<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> our

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
charting data and making sure that our

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
charting data and making sure that our
enrichment<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.470> enriching<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
enrichment is actually enriching the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.610 
enrichment is actually enriching the
animals<00:01:26.130> lives<00:01:26.340> our<00:01:27.300> group<00:01:27.630> worked<00:01:27.960> Alliance

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
animals lives our group worked Alliance

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.340 
animals lives our group worked Alliance
and<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.610> were<00:01:29.760> inspired<00:01:29.970> by<00:01:30.360> talking<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.230> one

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and we were inspired by talking to one

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.730 
and we were inspired by talking to one
of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> keepers<00:01:31.890> who<00:01:32.600> mentioned<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of the keepers who mentioned that one of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
of the keepers who mentioned that one of
the<00:01:34.800> lines<00:01:35.010> especially<00:01:35.280> liked<00:01:36.000> playing<00:01:36.660> with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the lines especially liked playing with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
the lines especially liked playing with
rhino<00:01:37.530> dung<00:01:37.920> smelling<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.730> rolling<00:01:39.090> around<00:01:39.210> in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
rhino dung smelling it rolling around in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
rhino dung smelling it rolling around in
it<00:01:39.660> which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> classic<00:01:40.410> predatory<00:01:40.920> behavior

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it which is a classic predatory behavior

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.510 
it which is a classic predatory behavior
we<00:01:42.030> made<00:01:42.300> something<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.350> dispenses<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we made something that dispenses it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.980 
we made something that dispenses it
could<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.150> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.570> scent<00:01:45.780> right

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
could really be any kind of scent right

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.920 
could really be any kind of scent right
now<00:01:46.110> we're<00:01:46.350> using<00:01:46.520> pre<00:01:47.520> pelletized<00:01:48.120> droppings

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
now we're using pre pelletized droppings

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.110 
now we're using pre pelletized droppings
from<00:01:49.260> animals<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.010> basically<00:01:50.370> fall<00:01:50.730> out<00:01:50.910> at

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
from animals they basically fall out at

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.390 
from animals they basically fall out at
timed<00:01:51.420> intervals<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.260> split<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.830> three

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
timed intervals and split out three

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.890 
timed intervals and split out three
different<00:01:53.520> pipes<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.120> there's<00:01:54.330> some<00:01:54.540> variety

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
different pipes so there's some variety

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.080 
different pipes so there's some variety
in<00:01:54.930> space<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.520> hoping<00:01:56.880> by

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
in space as well and we're hoping by

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.580 
in space as well and we're hoping by
delivering<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.840> enrichment<00:01:58.350> throughout

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
delivering this enrichment throughout

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.470 
delivering this enrichment throughout
the<00:01:58.770> day<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.310> encourage<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.180> more

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
the day will encourage them to be more

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.810 
the day will encourage them to be more
