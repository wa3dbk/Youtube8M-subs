the<00:00:10.920> starter<00:00:11.340> motor<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.360> turn<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the starter motor because you turn the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.450 
the starter motor because you turn the
key<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.049> get<00:00:13.139> absolutely<00:00:13.650> nothing<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.280> just

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
get a tiny little click we check the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010 
get a tiny little click we check the
battery<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.400> battery<00:00:17.520> checks<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.180> ok<00:00:18.570> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
battery the battery checks out ok we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.560 
battery the battery checks out ok we
check<00:00:19.289> down<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> starter<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
check down on the starter to see if it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
check down on the starter to see if it
has<00:00:22.070> power<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:24.119> does<00:00:24.769> also<00:00:25.970> why<00:00:26.970> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
has power and it does also why that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
has power and it does also why that
actually<00:00:27.300> turns<00:00:27.960> itself<00:00:28.349> oil<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> small

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
actually turns itself oil on a small

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.179 
actually turns itself oil on a small
wire<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.260> power<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
wire it does have power so you know the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
wire it does have power so you know the
starter<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.700> no<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.890> before<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.100> any

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
starter is no good so before we do any

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
starter is no good so before we do any
job<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> always<00:00:35.930> take<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> look<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> computer

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
job I always take a look on the computer

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.720 
job I always take a look on the computer
just<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> make<00:00:38.160> sure<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:40.489> procedures<00:00:41.489> is

computer it tells you that you need on a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.910 
computer it tells you that you need on a
four-wheel<00:00:50.100> drive<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.670> Jeep<00:00:50.910> Grand<00:00:51.920> Cherokee

you need to remove the front drive shaft

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709 
you need to remove the front drive shaft
in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> starter<00:00:57.690> out

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
in the way that they get the starter out

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.060 
in the way that they get the starter out
so<00:00:58.500> let<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.430> show<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> shortcut<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.680> saves<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and what I wasted step that actually I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
and what I wasted step that actually I
wound<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.580> doing<00:01:17.729> myself<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.570> everything

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
wound up doing myself because everything

wound up doing myself because everything
you<00:01:18.990> read<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> computer<00:01:19.830> tells<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you read on the computer tells you that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.130 
you read on the computer tells you that
you<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> take<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> drive<00:01:21.869> shaft

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you need to take this the drive shaft

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.210 
you need to take this the drive shaft
out<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.040> let<00:01:23.549> me<00:01:23.610> show<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:27.890> okay<00:01:28.890> usually

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
out so let me show you this okay usually

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
out so let me show you this okay usually
before<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.700> any<00:01:29.850> job<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.299> take<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:30.720> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
before I do any job all take a look on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
before I do any job all take a look on
the<00:01:30.960> computer<00:01:31.350> I'll<00:01:31.470> read<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> procedure<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the computer I'll read the procedure and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.170 
the computer I'll read the procedure and
as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.770> procedure<00:01:35.070> says<00:01:35.520> right

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
as you can see the procedure says right

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.539 
as you can see the procedure says right
here<00:01:36.350> know<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.860> equipped<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
here know if it's equipped with a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
here know if it's equipped with a
four-wheel<00:01:39.000> drive<00:01:39.299> remove<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> front<00:01:40.079> drive

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
four-wheel drive remove the front drive

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
four-wheel drive remove the front drive
shaft<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.700> exactly<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> did<00:01:42.720> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
shaft which is exactly what I did but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.149 
shaft which is exactly what I did but
then<00:01:43.140> after<00:01:43.380> looking<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:43.979> more

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
then after looking at a little more

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
then after looking at a little more
closely<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.610> realize<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.479> wasted

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
closely I realize that that's a wasted

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
closely I realize that that's a wasted
step<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.340> need<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
step you really don't need to take that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.700 
step you really don't need to take that
drive<00:01:48.509> shaft<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.170> let's<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.470> underneath

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
drive shaft out so let's get underneath

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.490 
drive shaft out so let's get underneath
the<00:01:49.890> vehicle<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> show<00:01:51.270> you

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the vehicle and I'm going to show you

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
what it looks like ok now you know the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.679 
what it looks like ok now you know the
starter<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> actually<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.509> driver's<00:02:03.509> side

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
starter is actually on the driver's side

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.530 
starter is actually on the driver's side
and<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> fairly

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and as you can see it is in a fairly

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.369 
and as you can see it is in a fairly
tight<00:02:06.930> spot<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:07.920> underneath<00:02:08.340> via<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.959> starter

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
tight spot up underneath via the starter

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.809 
tight spot up underneath via the starter
itself<00:02:10.770> is

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
itself is

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.330 
itself is
up<00:02:12.299> inside<00:02:12.719> here<00:02:13.049> these<00:02:13.709> are<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:13.980> star

up inside here these are the two star
the<00:02:14.489> bolts<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.420> as<00:02:15.599> well<00:02:16.409> as<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.709> one

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
the bolts this one as well as this one

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.410 
the bolts this one as well as this one

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
here you take these two bolts out and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.629 
here you take these two bolts out and
you<00:02:18.989> loosen<00:02:19.349> up<00:02:19.469> the<00:02:19.590> starter<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.549> it

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
you loosen up the starter now what it

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.459 
you loosen up the starter now what it
said<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> remove<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.629> drive<00:02:21.900> shaft<00:02:21.930> which

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
said is to remove this drive shaft which

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.770 
said is to remove this drive shaft which
is<00:02:22.499> just<00:02:22.829> what<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> did

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
is just what I did

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.000 
is just what I did
taking<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.870> drive<00:02:25.019> shaft<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.439> is<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.739> little

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
taking a drive shaft that is a little

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.410 
taking a drive shaft that is a little
bit<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.219> a<00:02:26.280> pain<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.639> the<00:02:26.700> rear<00:02:26.849> end<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.389> of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
bit of a pain in the rear end because of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
bit of a pain in the rear end because of
where<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:28.019> walk<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.469> bolts<00:02:28.739> are<00:02:28.859> situated

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
where the walk the bolts are situated

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.629 
where the walk the bolts are situated
but<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.629> did<00:02:31.049> take<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> drive<00:02:31.590> shaft<00:02:31.889> out<00:02:32.129> but

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
but I did take the drive shaft out but

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.649 
but I did take the drive shaft out but
then<00:02:32.760> after<00:02:33.000> looking<00:02:33.269> at<00:02:33.389> a<00:02:33.420> little<00:02:33.510> more

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
then after looking at a little more

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.449 
then after looking at a little more
closely<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.109> realized<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.799> wasted<00:02:35.159> step

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
closely I realized that's a wasted step

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.009 
closely I realized that's a wasted step
you<00:02:35.639> really<00:02:35.879> don't<00:02:36.120> need<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.780> shaft

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
you really don't need to take the shaft

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.929 
you really don't need to take the shaft
out<00:02:37.290> because<00:02:38.129> when<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.579> take<00:02:38.819> off<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:40.019> shield

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
out because when you take off the shield

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:47.890 
out because when you take off the shield
which<00:02:41.939> is<00:02:42.919> the<00:02:43.919> under<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:46.260> under<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.879> engine

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
which is the under the under the engine

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.830 
which is the under the under the engine
shield<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.980> open<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.669> you<00:02:50.730> look<00:02:50.939> and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
shield you open it up and you look and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.259 
shield you open it up and you look and
you've<00:02:52.199> got<00:02:52.409> plenty<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.769> space<00:02:53.239> right<00:02:54.239> up

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
you've got plenty of space right up

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.099 
you've got plenty of space right up
inside<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> as<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.579> see<00:02:57.109> there's

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
inside here and as you can see there's

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.619 
inside here and as you can see there's
the<00:02:58.349> starter<00:02:58.799> right<00:02:59.189> there<00:02:59.419> obviously<00:03:00.419> that's

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
the starter right there obviously that's

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.780 
the starter right there obviously that's
the<00:03:00.689> one<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.109> replaced<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.579> I<00:03:02.609> just

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the one I just replaced but I just

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.390 
the one I just replaced but I just
wanted<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> show<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.859> and<00:03:04.859> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
wanted to show that to you and the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.030 
wanted to show that to you and the
starter<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.939> actually<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.449> does<00:03:06.689> fit<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:07.859> in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
starter it actually it does fit right in

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.250 
starter it actually it does fit right in
here<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.949> the<00:03:11.040> old<00:03:11.159> starter<00:03:12.169> it's<00:03:13.169> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
here this is the old starter it's a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.050 
here this is the old starter it's a
tight<00:03:13.500> spot<00:03:14.629> but<00:03:15.629> as<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.439> can<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:17.060> looking

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
tight spot but as you can see looking

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.439 
tight spot but as you can see looking
like<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.479> yeah<00:03:18.629> see<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.019> see<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:20.449> you

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
like that yeah see you can see as you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.289 
like that yeah see you can see as you
can<00:03:21.629> see<00:03:21.959> even<00:03:22.889> with<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.280> old<00:03:23.400> starter<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.090> mean

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
can see even with the old starter I mean

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.729 
can see even with the old starter I mean
the<00:03:24.389> new<00:03:24.509> starter<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.049> there<00:03:25.229> you<00:03:25.349> all<00:03:25.470> saw

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the new starter in there you all saw

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.069 
the new starter in there you all saw
that<00:03:25.769> does<00:03:26.159> fit<00:03:26.459> right<00:03:27.150> through<00:03:27.419> here<00:03:27.629> so<00:03:27.930> it

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that does fit right through here so it

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.789 
that does fit right through here so it
is<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.229> wasted<00:03:28.739> step<00:03:30.199> taking<00:03:31.199> out<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.500> drive

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
is a wasted step taking out that drive

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.949 
is a wasted step taking out that drive
shaft<00:03:31.829> so<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.939> you<00:03:33.060> follow<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.540> procedure

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
shaft so if you follow this procedure

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.020 
shaft so if you follow this procedure
you're<00:03:34.769> going<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:34.979> save<00:03:35.189> yourself<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.699> bunch<00:03:35.909> of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you're going to save yourself a bunch of

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.869 
you're going to save yourself a bunch of
time<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:37.590> job<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.829> going<00:03:37.979> to<00:03:38.069> go<00:03:38.189> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.459> a

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
time and the job is going to go a lot a

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.589 
time and the job is going to go a lot a
lot<00:03:39.150> quicker<00:03:39.419> then<00:03:40.349> then<00:03:41.159> it<00:03:41.310> then<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.150> says<00:03:42.299> on

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
lot quicker then then it then it says on

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.539 
lot quicker then then it then it says on
the<00:03:42.689> computer<00:03:43.229> by<00:03:43.769> removing<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:44.310> drive

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
the computer by removing that drive

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.539 
the computer by removing that drive
shaft<00:03:45.229> okay<00:03:46.229> this<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.069> oldest

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
shaft okay this is the the oldest

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.849 
shaft okay this is the the oldest
daughter<00:03:47.759> obviously<00:03:48.389> but<00:03:49.079> basically<00:03:49.650> once

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
daughter obviously but basically once

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.170 
daughter obviously but basically once
you<00:03:49.949> have<00:03:50.099> these<00:03:50.220> bolts<00:03:50.609> out<00:03:50.699> that<00:03:50.909> I<00:03:50.970> showed

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
you have these bolts out that I showed

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.649 
you have these bolts out that I showed
you<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.509> back<00:03:51.720> by<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.590> buddy<00:03:53.659> started

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
you in the back by the buddy started

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.729 
you in the back by the buddy started
down<00:03:54.780> there<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.019> got<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.199> remove<00:03:55.469> them<00:03:55.620> and

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739
