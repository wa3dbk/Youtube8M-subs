00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.290 

here's<00:00:14.840> another<00:00:15.139> edition<00:00:15.799> and<00:00:15.949> boob<00:00:16.300> 11.5

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
here's another edition and boob 11.5

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.440 
here's another edition and boob 11.5
it's<00:00:17.689> now<00:00:18.380> particles<00:00:19.070> can<00:00:19.279> interact<00:00:19.520> with

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
it's now particles can interact with

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.640 
it's now particles can interact with
static<00:00:21.079> ecosystem<00:00:22.090> as<00:00:23.090> an<00:00:23.240> example<00:00:23.509> we'll<00:00:24.439> go

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
static ecosystem as an example we'll go

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.869 
static ecosystem as an example we'll go
create<00:00:28.869> let<00:00:29.869> me<00:00:29.990> get<00:00:30.080> some<00:00:30.410> platform<00:00:33.730> can<00:00:34.730> I

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
create let me get some platform can I

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.439 
create let me get some platform can I
don't<00:00:35.059> want<00:00:35.180> very<00:00:35.420> big<00:00:35.660> for<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:37.030> this<00:00:38.030> example

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
don't want very big for the this example

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.990 
don't want very big for the this example
and<00:00:41.449> before<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:41.979> create<00:00:42.979> the<00:00:43.070> object<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.820> make

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
and before we create the object and make

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.229 
and before we create the object and make
it<00:00:44.180> interact<00:00:44.869> so<00:00:45.559> right<00:00:45.799> now<00:00:45.830> as<00:00:46.400> example<00:00:47.089> we

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
it interact so right now as example we

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.420 
it interact so right now as example we
can<00:00:47.390> go<00:00:47.600> ahead<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:49.089> create<00:00:50.199> ecosystem<00:00:51.430> so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
can go ahead and create ecosystem so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.490 
can go ahead and create ecosystem so
let's<00:00:52.610> go<00:00:52.760> ahead<00:00:52.790> promote<00:00:53.420> some<00:00:53.629> object<00:00:56.500> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
let's go ahead promote some object and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.259 
let's go ahead promote some object and
I'm<00:00:57.619> just<00:00:58.040> using<00:00:58.220> simple<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:01.129> fear<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.850> bit

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
I'm just using simple this fear a bit

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:11.050 
I'm just using simple this fear a bit
too<00:01:02.659> much<00:01:02.869> of<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:03.439> let's<00:01:03.650> avoid

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:24.160 

and<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.659> scamming

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.010 

ok

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.889 

so<00:01:29.590> for<00:01:29.710> example<00:01:29.740> here<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.609> our<00:01:30.939> ecosystem<00:01:31.810> we

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
so for example here is our ecosystem we

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.760 
so for example here is our ecosystem we
can<00:01:32.049> populate<00:01:32.289> with<00:01:32.500> trees<00:01:33.009> or<00:01:33.250> anything<00:01:33.729> for

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
can populate with trees or anything for

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.969 
can populate with trees or anything for
houses<00:01:35.770> some<00:01:36.189> time<00:01:36.429> of<00:01:36.609> Brander<00:01:36.939> we<00:01:37.060> can<00:01:37.240> do

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
houses some time of Brander we can do

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.559 
houses some time of Brander we can do
just<00:01:38.979> as<00:01:39.219> fears<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:42.549> next<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.149> want<00:01:43.329> to<00:01:43.420> create

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
just as fears get next I want to create

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.039 
just as fears get next I want to create
my<00:01:43.689> meter<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.369> i'll<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.850> do<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.270> top<00:01:46.689> right

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
my meter and i'll just do on top right

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:55.350 
my meter and i'll just do on top right
here<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:52.450> put<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.630> above<00:01:53.399> let's<00:01:54.399> go<00:01:54.670> same<00:01:55.000> at

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
here just put it above let's go same at

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.230 
here just put it above let's go same at
particle<00:01:55.959> echo<00:01:56.289> system<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.979> i'm<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:58.149> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
particle echo system and i'm going to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.740 
particle echo system and i'm going to
add<00:01:58.689> another<00:02:00.149> sphere<00:02:01.860> okay<00:02:02.860> well<00:02:03.130> go<00:02:03.579> ahead

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
add another sphere okay well go ahead

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.289 
add another sphere okay well go ahead
enable<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.899> particle<00:02:05.530> motion<00:02:05.970> never<00:02:06.970> end

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
enable the particle motion never end

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.050 
enable the particle motion never end
right<00:02:07.569> here<00:02:08.019> when<00:02:08.440> we<00:02:08.619> going<00:02:08.920> into<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.640> Edit

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
right here when we going into the Edit

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.240 
right here when we going into the Edit
particle<00:02:10.479> motion<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:11.440> order<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
particle motion in order to we have a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.210 
particle motion in order to we have a
collision<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:13.000> static<00:02:13.660> ecosystem<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.980> let's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
collision with static ecosystem so let's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
collision with static ecosystem so let's
enable<00:02:16.829> this<00:02:17.829> point<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:19.329> next<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.959> will

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
enable this point the next I will

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.490 
enable this point the next I will
actually<00:02:20.380> decrease<00:02:20.739> dense<00:02:21.280> state<00:02:21.549> or<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
actually decrease dense state or one and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.610 
actually decrease dense state or one and
as<00:02:23.500> well<00:02:24.190> we'll<00:02:25.150> go<00:02:25.420> populate<00:02:25.989> once<00:02:26.260> because

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
as well we'll go populate once because

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.059 
as well we'll go populate once because
other<00:02:26.799> one<00:02:27.040> kind<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:27.700> overload<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.510> system

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.300 

get<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.250> silt<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.850> compute<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.310> maybe

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
get the silt a compute and maybe

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.450 
get the silt a compute and maybe
decrease<00:02:36.910> Lee<00:02:37.120> between<00:02:37.389> a<00:02:37.420> scaling

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.840 

when<00:02:44.460> we<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.850> view<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:48.740> ok<00:02:49.740> let's<00:02:50.520> go<00:02:50.790> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
when we can view you can ok let's go to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.920 
when we can view you can ok let's go to
switch

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.600 

to<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> seconds<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.540> your<00:03:00.530> shrink<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:01.430> can

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
to the seconds and your shrink so we can

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.380 
to the seconds and your shrink so we can
kind<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.470> adjust<00:03:03.470> faster<00:03:04.270> like<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.780> see

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
kind of adjust faster like you can see

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.860 
kind of adjust faster like you can see
interaction<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:10.400> right<00:03:11.030> here<00:03:11.300> example

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
interaction like right here example

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.710 
interaction like right here example
again<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.590> just<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.130> preview<00:03:13.370> render<00:03:13.760> but

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
again this is just a preview render but

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.320 
again this is just a preview render but
you<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.990> see<00:03:15.200> interaction<00:03:16.100> how<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:16.940> going

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
you can see interaction how they going

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:27.290 
you can see interaction how they going
around<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.710> this<00:03:18.920> area<00:03:20.590> Iran<00:03:21.590> ecosystem

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.390 

okay<00:03:27.960> of<00:03:28.110> course<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.650> make<00:03:28.860> little<00:03:29.100> bit

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
okay of course we can make little bit

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.760 
okay of course we can make little bit
more<00:03:30.210> interesting<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.560> want

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
more interesting with this if you want

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.040 
more interesting with this if you want
it<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.070> go<00:03:32.400> ahead<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:33.200> maybe<00:03:34.430> increase

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
it we can go ahead and maybe increase

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:44.880 
it we can go ahead and maybe increase
last<00:03:37.050> year<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:38.790> pup<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.620> sand

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.980 

as<00:03:45.790> well<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.510> take<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.780> cube<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.990> right

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
as well we can take a cube and right

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.530 
as well we can take a cube and right
click<00:03:53.260> go<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.770> objects<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:57.540> enable

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
click go to objects and enable

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.870 
click go to objects and enable
collisions<00:03:59.050> notice<00:03:59.980> right<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.640> not<00:04:00.850> a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
collisions notice right now it's not a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.120 
collisions notice right now it's not a
one-<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.840> submenus<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:02.950> have

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
one- you have it submenus so you have

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.740 
one- you have it submenus so you have
submenu<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.000> layers<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:04.770> object<00:04:06.750> wait

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
submenu of the layers and object wait

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.560 
submenu of the layers and object wait
right<00:04:08.020> here<00:04:08.170> okay<00:04:10.200> let's<00:04:11.200> go<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.440> our<00:04:11.650> plane

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
right here okay let's go to our plane

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.620 
right here okay let's go to our plane
recompute<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:15.030> right<00:04:16.030> here<00:04:16.269> there<00:04:16.419> go<00:04:16.570> you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
recompute and right here there go you

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.550 
recompute and right here there go you
can<00:04:16.870> see<00:04:17.109> now<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.290> bouncing<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:19.560> collision

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
can see now the bouncing and collision

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.220 
can see now the bouncing and collision
kind<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.890> working<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.660> they're<00:04:22.660> affecting

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
kind of working so they're affecting

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.119 
kind of working so they're affecting
with<00:04:23.380> ecosystem<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:25.060> populated<00:04:25.570> inside

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.939 

even<00:04:32.879> this<00:04:33.029> a<00:04:33.089> small<00:04:33.599> look<00:04:33.959> edition<00:04:34.559> but<00:04:34.739> this

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
even this a small look edition but this

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.709 
even this a small look edition but this
is<00:04:35.129> a<00:04:35.159> very<00:04:36.169> calculation<00:04:37.169> intensive<00:04:38.009> was<00:04:38.719> hard

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
is a very calculation intensive was hard

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.869 
is a very calculation intensive was hard
to<00:04:39.809> calculate<00:04:39.989> with<00:04:40.349> ecosystem<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.669> say<00:04:41.849> a

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
to calculate with ecosystem and I say a

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.689 
to calculate with ecosystem and I say a
lot<00:04:42.179> of<00:04:42.389> uses<00:04:42.809> of<00:04:43.169> example<00:04:44.159> we<00:04:44.309> increased

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
lot of uses of example we increased

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.939 
lot of uses of example we increased
thickness<00:04:44.879> we<00:04:45.869> can<00:04:46.019> create<00:04:46.289> as<00:04:46.559> snowflakes

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
thickness we can create as snowflakes

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.089 
thickness we can create as snowflakes
falling<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.089> stick<00:04:48.389> on<00:04:48.569> a<00:04:48.599> trees<00:04:48.989> we<00:04:49.949> can

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
falling and stick on a trees we can

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.949 
falling and stick on a trees we can
create<00:04:50.369> the<00:04:50.580> range<00:04:50.939> that<00:04:51.179> dropping<00:04:51.629> down

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:51.959 
create the range that dropping down

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.439 
create the range that dropping down
through<00:04:52.319> the<00:04:52.439> tree<00:04:52.709> and<00:04:52.919> I<00:04:53.849> probable<00:04:54.300> go

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
through the tree and I probable go

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.899 
through the tree and I probable go
create<00:04:54.779> some<00:04:54.989> tutorials<00:04:55.559> how<00:04:55.739> to<00:04:55.800> do<00:04:56.159> this<00:04:56.339> so

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
create some tutorials how to do this so

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.629 
create some tutorials how to do this so
we<00:04:57.029> can<00:04:57.059> preview<00:04:57.719> which<00:04:58.589> is<00:04:58.619> create<00:04:59.129> a<00:04:59.159> real

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
we can preview which is create a real

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.089 
we can preview which is create a real
