 try on the further stages of your 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 workout loses various 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.350
 situations that a person can

 encounter in real combat situations 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.840
 the more lost the situation 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.130
 more likely to leave 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 the winner 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 given the fact that the situations themselves by 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.769
 currently not repeated in this life 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.099
 try to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.620
 depart from the concept of working 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.860
 uses no tricks 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.230
 and general technical actions are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.899

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.059
 different situations the situation is worth 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 model a change in setting with 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.670
 various types of weapons henchmen 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 With funds, remember that the closer 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 created situation to real combat 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.290
 the better you are 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.260
 prepared 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.930
 we list the main technical steps 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.670
 which are used when working it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.540
 strikes as a technical action blocks 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.450
 case protection 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.939
 capture and release from captures throws 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 retention effects on joints 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.810
 impacts on vulnerable areas and point 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.380
 human body circles 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 helix levers use force 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.180
 opponent's movements against him this 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 what should the combat system consist of 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 do not be afraid to move away from the standard 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 tricks play try points 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.320
 The view is not only defeat well from the point 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.320
 of view 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 detention 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.800
 practicing on such a system we recommend 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.760
 derive general patterns in battle
