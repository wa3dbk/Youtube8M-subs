00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.400
 Tetris I loved Tetris back then 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.870
 I played it like a dumbass 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.389
 probably because it could not 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.709
 then a gameboy but at some point can 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.660
 At the moment I broke my money 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.550
 made with her game so frustrated 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.020
 Do I have that I know how it happens 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.580
 It's clear I have the gamer 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.990
 I think he has not less than 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.350
 young carved in the head screen 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.910
 broken 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.410
 this is the personal anecdote and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.850
 indeed, and luckily that was 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.130
 now the super bad transition 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.480
 in addition to keeping it offline 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.320
 I can play with such a nice one 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.930
 tetris lampl school or we have here 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.210
 a beautiful tetris lamp 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.420
 from seven individual perpetrators - that's the name 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.400
 which and one of this blue has the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.070
 a power supply when I'm there 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.050
 stones on it died here will stream 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.430
 then they start to light up 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.840
 that's really nice 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 Dekkoartikel then you can already young 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.270
 put down 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.070
 especially that is really cool that is 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.780
 still expandable if you are more than 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.429
 you can buy a son set with it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 do whatever you want 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:20.119
 I 've prepared something like that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.530
 Season simply in the manual 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.380
 that's sort of is mine 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.060
 challenge that you can not do more than 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.999
 five of these single stone 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.799
 stacked on top of each other should have no 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.590
 I do not know why but maybe 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.209
 yes right out, well, and now I have to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.799
 almost the video of me still 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.529
 tell something while I just 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.270
 start to build and more for me 

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:42.289
 think that will be the worst again 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.209
 what we did 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.109
 but it does not matter because maybe not 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.359
 Maybe if I have one again 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.399
 from the beginning look at times said 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.319
 but sometimes you know what you know 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.310
 Just in the comments 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.810
 vote which is the bad one 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.670
 the video we made here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.099
 that would really interest me 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 the only good idea one sees meanwhile 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.770
 that the even nonsense I'm loose 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.689
 more than five years 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.829
 but it is also slowly becoming difficult 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.829
 recognizes the following melody 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.320
 okay was a bit wrong but me 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.750
 give another tip here 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.730
 our map our map now 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.820
 betrayed solution I have is there 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.270
 not there then things turn out to 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.570
 Besides 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.090
 okay i still go carefully each one 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.459
 others next to it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.320
 we have five sets here that's called 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.920
 is quite a lot of money but I hope 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.209
 cool out 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560
 Imagine you had that 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.290
 the two might even have come 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.090
 maybe my name can write 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.250
 maybe even write his name 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.250
 could or cry
