expert I try we're gonna put this on the
stove<00:01:29.810> I'm<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:30.770> we're<00:01:30.890> gonna<00:01:30.950> let<00:01:31.159> this

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
stove I'm and then we're gonna let this

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.550 
stove I'm and then we're gonna let this
cook<00:01:31.340> down<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.960> how<00:01:33.110> do<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.260> know<00:01:33.350> when<00:01:33.439> you're

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
cook down so how do you know when you're

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.380 
cook down so how do you know when you're
done<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.430> there's<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> couple<00:01:34.760> of<00:01:34.939> ways<00:01:35.090> of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
done so there's a couple of ways of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.440 
done so there's a couple of ways of
finding<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.320> out<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.979> one<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.729> cook<00:01:37.939> it<00:01:38.090> for

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
finding that out so one you cook it for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.270 
finding that out so one you cook it for
the<00:01:38.600> amount<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.080> time<00:01:39.140> specified<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:39.860> your<00:01:40.159> new

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the amount of time specified in your new

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.020 
the amount of time specified in your new
recipe<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.000> then<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:42.490> once<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.610> get<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
recipe and then to once you get to the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.230 
recipe and then to once you get to the
end<00:01:44.299> I'll<00:01:44.810> cooking<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.770> can<00:01:45.970> scrape<00:01:46.970> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
end I'll cooking you can scrape the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.570 
end I'll cooking you can scrape the
bottom<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.780> pot<00:01:48.020> oh<00:01:48.259> yeah<00:01:48.470> how<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
bottom of the pot oh yeah how it
