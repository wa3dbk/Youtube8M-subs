another 35 minutes and I tested it with

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.210 
another 35 minutes and I tested it with
a<00:03:25.400> toothpick<00:03:27.340> what<00:03:28.340> I'm<00:03:28.460> gonna<00:03:28.580> do<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:31.040> I'm

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
a toothpick what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:45.190 
a toothpick what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:03:31.340> turn<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.880> upside<00:03:32.270> down

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:58.190 

try<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.319> get<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.470> out<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.950> here<00:03:52.730> okay<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:58.050> I'm

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
try and get it out of here okay and I'm

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.320

going<00:03:58.500> to<00:04:00.290> turn<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.040> right<00:04:02.070> side<00:04:02.580> right

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
going to turn it the right side right

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.699 
going to turn it the right side right
way<00:04:04.880> will<00:04:05.880> let<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.209> cool<00:04:06.510> down<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
way will let this cool down and the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.620 
way will let this cool down and the
reason<00:04:08.040> why<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.220> cut<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:09.090> because<00:04:09.390> it's

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
reason why I cut it is because it's

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.370 
reason why I cut it is because it's
going<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.930> crack<00:04:10.260> anyway<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.270> if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.050> make

going to crack anyway and so if you make

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.039 
going to crack anyway and so if you make
a<00:04:13.410> crack<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.850> crack<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.360> where<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.690> want<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
a crack the crack is where you want it

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.460
