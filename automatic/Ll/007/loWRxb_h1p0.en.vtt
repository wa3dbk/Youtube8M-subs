the<00:02:15.830> studs<00:02:16.069> or<00:02:16.700> anything<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.209> kind<00:02:17.780> of

the studs or anything like that kind of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.210 
the studs or anything like that kind of
like<00:02:18.019> best<00:02:18.290> lock<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.739> thought<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.099> were

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
like best lock so I thought they were

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.699 
like best lock so I thought they were
best<00:02:19.489> not<00:02:19.780> until<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.840> realized<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.410> here's

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
best not until I realized that here's

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.539 
best not until I realized that here's
the<00:02:21.799> best<00:02:21.920> lock<00:02:22.099> figure<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:25.129> best<00:02:25.370> lock

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
the best lock figure I have best lock

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.770 
the best lock figure I have best lock

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.190 
legs for sure machining they don't sorry
that<00:02:29.959> was<00:02:30.080> out<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.290> frame<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:31.010> an<00:02:31.099> idiot<00:02:32.200> they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that was out of frame I'm an idiot they

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.360 
that was out of frame I'm an idiot they
have<00:02:33.410> almost<00:02:34.250> best<00:02:34.670> lock<00:02:34.849> clicks<00:02:36.069> as<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.220> can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
have almost best lock clicks as you can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.190 
have almost best lock clicks as you can
see<00:02:37.549> they<00:02:37.730> have<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> same<00:02:38.090> style<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:39.049> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
see they have the same style but not the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.740 
see they have the same style but not the
same<00:02:39.470> attachment<00:02:40.459> process<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.470> best<00:02:42.470> lock

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
same attachment process and best lock

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.410 
same attachment process and best lock
all<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.900> figures<00:02:45.200> are<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.980> skin<00:02:46.940> color<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
all the figures are this skin color and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.420 
all the figures are this skin color and
these<00:02:50.420> guys<00:02:50.599> are<00:02:50.629> not<00:02:51.640> however<00:02:52.640> they<00:02:52.879> do<00:02:54.430> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
these guys are not however they do and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.430 
these guys are not however they do and
they<00:02:55.519> do<00:02:55.579> not<00:02:55.819> have<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.150> best<00:02:56.329> lock<00:02:56.599> elbow<00:02:57.049> in

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
they do not have the best lock elbow in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.550 
they do not have the best lock elbow in
their<00:02:57.620> arms<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> thought<00:02:59.840> what<00:03:00.260> about<00:03:00.290> that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
their arms so I thought what about that

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.740 
their arms so I thought what about that
other<00:03:00.709> fake<00:03:01.069> Lego<00:03:01.340> set<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.879> picked<00:03:02.599> up

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
other fake Lego set I picked up

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.490 
other fake Lego set I picked up
coincidentally<00:03:05.750> all<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> them<00:03:06.079> have<00:03:06.230> assault

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
coincidentally all of them have assault

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.800 
coincidentally all of them have assault
rifles<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:08.739> they<00:03:09.739> have<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> same<00:03:10.129> torso<00:03:10.810> if

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
rifles and they have the same torso if

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.920 
rifles and they have the same torso if
you<00:03:11.989> can<00:03:12.170> see<00:03:12.349> that<00:03:13.030> focus<00:03:14.030> focus<00:03:16.720> never<00:03:17.720> going

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
you can see that focus focus never going

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.390 
you can see that focus focus never going
to<00:03:17.959> do<00:03:18.109> it<00:03:18.170> over<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.440> they<00:03:19.130> have<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.280> same

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
to do it over you they have the same

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.819 
to do it over you they have the same
torso<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.940> see<00:03:20.060> they<00:03:20.180> have<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.329> same<00:03:20.450> arms

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
torso so you see they have the same arms

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.780 
torso so you see they have the same arms
basically<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.920> same<00:03:22.069> hands<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.519> mean<00:03:22.549> they're

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
basically the same hands I mean they're

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.420 
basically the same hands I mean they're
slightly<00:03:23.030> different<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.620> same<00:03:24.889> toaster

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
slightly different but the same toaster

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.809 
slightly different but the same toaster
design<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:26.810> different<00:03:27.079> legs<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.519> head

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
design just different legs and the head

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.360 
design just different legs and the head
is<00:03:29.209> fairly<00:03:29.599> similar<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.319> well<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.130> remember

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
is fairly similar as well so I remember

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.500

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
right these ones have a gaping hole in

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.849 
right these ones have a gaping hole in
the<00:03:32.720> top<00:03:33.700> well<00:03:34.700> I'll<00:03:34.970> never<00:03:35.209> be<00:03:35.359> able<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.569> tell

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
the top well I'll never be able to tell

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.740 
the top well I'll never be able to tell
but<00:03:36.859> these<00:03:37.069> guys<00:03:37.250> have<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.639> know<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.359> fairly
