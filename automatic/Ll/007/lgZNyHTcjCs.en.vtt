00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.300 
out of him unfortunately so I don't know
i<00:04:15.840> would<00:04:16.140> i<00:04:16.380> would<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.680> recommend<00:04:16.859> him<00:04:17.280> for

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310

and<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.050> team<00:04:26.260> maybe<00:04:26.710> change<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:27.160> around<00:04:27.250> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
and this team maybe change it around a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.680 
and this team maybe change it around a
little<00:04:27.490> bit<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:27.940> cut<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.270> cost<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.570> it

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
little bit you can cut the cost of it

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.030 
little bit you can cut the cost of it
without<00:04:28.810> getting<00:04:28.960> informed<00:04:29.410> on<00:04:29.650> beer<00:04:29.830> and
