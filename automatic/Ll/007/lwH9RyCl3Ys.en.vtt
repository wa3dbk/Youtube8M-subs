00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 and I will try to explain what they are 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.820
 the best conditions in which 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.110
 you can have a squirrel at home 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 First, what you need to know is 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.490
 that squirrels are pretty animals 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 Nervous people who usually like 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.770
 a lot of climbing and they need large cages 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 but we have to be careful 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.489
 Be careful not to escape in any 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 they will use it to be able to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.930
 escape and believe me when I tell you that they are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.510
 tremendously fast animals and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 tremendously agile is to say if you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.980
 escape at home will cost you a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.769
 triumph catch them but if it escapes us 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.749
 only when at the beginning they are still 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.530
 a little wild and you have not seen them 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.879
 accustomed to the hand if you get to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 escape in the garden is going to be 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.129
 practically impossible that you can 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 recover is why many 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 squirrel species 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.390
 now they are controlled and it is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 regulated their tenure because many of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 they have become a problem 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.220
 environmental because they are species 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 invaders 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.979
 then take care with your cages 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 squirrels can not escape good 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.430
 and having said that we have a cage already 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.430
 I say it's going to be as wide as possible 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.980
 in which we are going to fill in as always 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 the substrate soil 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.810
 already if you have seen some video of mine 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 you'll be sick of hearing the floor that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 we like it for almost all animals 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.450
 exotic is this paper floor of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 Newspaper 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.690
 We put a good base of paper floor 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's scatter the nothing with it from 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.009
 a depth of about two fingers is more 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.009
 enough 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.700
 a good idea is to bring them jce already 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.250
 from the store enclosed in this type 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.410
 of cage squirrels are some pets 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.120
 very special as I said are very 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.580
 Nervous is not an animal that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.860
 first I'll let you take it and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.080
 caress na you will have seen in almost all 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.180
 the videos that I usually catch everyone 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.519
 the animals in some way so that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 you may see the way they catch the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.569
 meek that are the ones after the quiet ones 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.090
 which are in general but it is not like that with 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.850
 the squirrels are worth I want to emphasize 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.160
 this because these squirrels have a 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.830
 very great ability to escape 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.049
 and does not mean that in the future no 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 you can enjoy them but 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.140
 at least until now 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 we started doing at hand they have to 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.130
 be locked in your cage you go to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.750
 enjoy them too much but 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.790
 another way between them play a lot 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.700
 they run a lot but believe me they are 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.220
 excessively agile, fast and nervous 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.280
 that needs more the cage because besides the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.640
 cage needs 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.800
 some trunks that simulate the trees 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.980
 where they usually live 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.200
 preferably are wood 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.660
 oak or oak wood that is a 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.050
 hardwood is also worth the eucalyptus 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 but try to avoid the trunks that 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.020
 they have resin all the pines and so on 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.640
 it is better not to use them trees 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.530
 fruit trees are also good idea because 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.960
 even the trunk of the trees 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 Fruit trees can be ingested and served 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.480
 as an extra fiber in the diet 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.470
 we can put the logs in the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.060
 disposition that best suits us even 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.590
 we can also change them from time to time 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.660
 when so that they do not get bored always 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.300
 with the same elements how many more 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.270
 things we can better fit me with the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.980
 cage also came a twig for me 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.980
 the ramp inside 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.210
 I tell you more tricks also by 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.770
 united example and the very important nest 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.380
 fill it with hay but I've been 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.440
 forgotten so wait a second in 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.190
 me please I need some hay 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.430
 Behold 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.989
 here we have it together we can put it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.030
 where we want will help us as 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.340
 element especially the temporary that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.380
 We want to pretend that the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.320
 animals are going to raise us and how 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.290
 shelter gives you the phenomenal hay 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.480
 come then the hay does not have either 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.810
 Greater mystery do two functions 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.400
 mainly on the one hand they're going to 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.160
 ingest what they will eat as a source of 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.660
 food for another very important about 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.800
 all at the beginning as refuge 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.680
 so we take a good pack of hay 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.280
 and we hide it so they can be 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.280
 save 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.089
 What do I need? 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.399
 So you know the most important thing is the water and 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:01.399
 the food the water and the food we never 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:03.589
 All water must be absent 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:07.839
 drinking fountains that work best are these 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.839
 water bowls that have a ball 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.910
 Well, the water inside 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.490
 and finally the food for it 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.900
 we will use a normal pileup and 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.419
 food stream 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.210
 and that I want to explain to you about the food of 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.490
 the squirrels because several little things that is 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.919
 important to pay attention to me 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.840
 squirrels have the ability to hibernate 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.199
 when the cold arrives they lower their 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.300
 metabolism begin to eat a lot 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.820
 more with the arrival of autumn because 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.780
 they prepare the winter to be 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.720
 hibernating and being stuck and refugees 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.820
 but this happens in nature inside 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.289
 of house with heating are not going to 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.660
 hibernate but they do have the 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.240
 behavior of eating too much there 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.520
 to be very careful not to overdo 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.070
 especially in seeds at the time of 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.169
 feed the squirrels all feed 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.690
 all squirrel feeding is going to have 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.030
 different types of seeds here you see 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.889
 a bit the composition and you can search 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.250
 the video that we have also made 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.460
 feeding the squirrels where you 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.630
 I'm going to elaborate a lot more on detailing 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.120
 what is a complete diet 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.789
 simply now is that you do not exceed 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.680
 in seeds because they fatten them a lot and 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.969
 yes that makes sense if the squirrels go 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.189
 to hibernate but it does not make sense 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.719
 the squirrels are going to keep for 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:37.279
 all the year active as it happens 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.379
 normally inside our houses 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.969
 where the temperature throughout all 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.969
 the year is more or less constant
