 wish to have the form for 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.270

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.719
 unique on skyrim it's two 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.540
 abers companone created by meimei 1580 8 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 and 0 dull halide and it's a mode that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 date of 2013 and who had a lot of time 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.260
 updated during the course of 2014 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.650
 that I will list you in this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 video 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.289
 on this a good viewing first of all 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 how to find this follower who is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 rather special I invite you to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 that to make you 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 audard de la bei which is the local bar of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500
 the city of fayez and there you go the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.960
 find inside in the process of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 nap on the floor just 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 talk to him so he can follow you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 and fight with you very well 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 be careful it's not an ordinary bear 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.950
 that you come across in the game this one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 contains an attack breaking the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 making it more powerful than a basic bear 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.989
 of the game skyrim 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.940
 you can also perform some 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.420
 exchanges with this one if you wear 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.039
 too much merchandise 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 there are in total nine options including 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 one that would aim to give back the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 basic characteristic of the back goes br 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.799
 otherwise about the other eight that you 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 will either add armor in 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 do to both to berre or be of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 change your skin color for example 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.310
 we will have to panda or bear snow and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 so 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 I leave you with the nine 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.970
 image samples of available 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.310
 this mode will also offer you a whole 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.080
 new background that is pretty 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.080
 friendly during your time of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.820
 loading here is a mode 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.320
 which is likely to be very 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.330
 interesting for people who 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.090
 would use stealth it's all about 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.010
 silent smiley is recreated by rex ux and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.960
 this one will aim to silence the bear 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.790
 when you go stealthy 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.910
 which gives a much more ambiance 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.930
 realistic for people who 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.640
 would like a translation 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.770
 French speaking of this mode 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 know that there is one on the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.910
 fraternity of the travelos but as 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 always she is late and she does not 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.490
 does not contain the update I'm going 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.080
 you list at the moment to finish 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.120
 I will tell you about the biggest 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 update that there was on this mode it 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.220
 is about turning your back is going to baer 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.720
 became ouzghar or so it's very 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 simple to use this 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.760
 transformation you must imperatively 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.200
 to have the dragon dlc terminals without it 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.810
 will not work because you will not have 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.060
 not the basic resources of the bears 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.519
 werewolf then you will open 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.820
 the inventory of your basic faber 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.260
 and you will take the first potion 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.760
 man or rather mead first man 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.590
 which is available at the very top 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.450
 once you have it in your 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.860
 inventory you go the team and a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.630
 Once you have it in your hands 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.090
 go see that pretty funny because 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.769
 your valbert in celebration will have the smile 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 when you hold it in your hands 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.239
 and as soon as you actually go the row 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.310
 he will not smile at all anymore 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.680
 you launch it with your click 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.440
 left on him and he will have access to the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.110
 transformation directly then after 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.400
 there is no problem with for example the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.989
 villagers or guards 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.180
 he does not attack rap at your heels 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.560
 werewolf but for example other the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.080
 furniture or the other creatures that get 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.390
 will show hostile towards you there it is 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.459
 will show a lot more aggressive and eight 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.840
 beds' will even be frost spells for 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.610
 tell you how much this werewolf 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.860
 is more powerful than the others that 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.340
 you can meet on the dragon dlc 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.380
 bounds 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.959
 you have to know that its transformation into 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.510
 a limited time so enjoy it as soon as 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.700
 you need it most is 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.049
 among others there is still a potion 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.060
 mead, which I do not have at all 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.750
 understood the operation which consists 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.390
 simply to make disappear 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.760
 robert for a short time otherwise on 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.660
 he will bring honey and another 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 mead that is absolutely useless 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 this unique fashion presentation 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.120
 ends here she just had to 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.040
 purpose of enumerating the operation 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
 from last update 2 available 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.030
 with dowa mode baer companion 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.680
 I hope you'll have more than that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.360
 you have been useful as a video 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.920

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.630
 have thought in the comments here 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.910
 underneath dropped a little like if you 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.500
 have a little time and if you can 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.090
 even share this video whatever it is 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.550
 on social networks such as twitter 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.770

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.350
 service to promote the content of my 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.700
 chain and as usual the people who 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.260
 are constantly asking the question when 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.390
 do I go out videos etc 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.250
