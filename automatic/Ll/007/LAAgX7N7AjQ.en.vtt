00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
make a cream and what this cream does is

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.680 
make a cream and what this cream does is
basically<00:00:10.620> picks<00:00:11.040> up<00:00:11.190> items<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:12.360> can<00:00:12.480> modify

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
basically picks up items you can modify

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.609 
basically picks up items you can modify
the<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:14.000> pool<00:00:15.000> part<00:00:15.299> here<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:16.139> pick<00:00:16.529> up

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619

whatever you want chess blocks you can

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.160 
whatever you want chess blocks you can
modify<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> pick<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.369> animals<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.020> make

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
modify it to pick up animals if you make

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670 
modify it to pick up animals if you make
a<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.670> like<00:00:23.670> thing<00:00:24.390> around<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> box

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a little like thing around like a box

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
a little like thing around like a box
around<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.310> frames<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.240> connect

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
around the frames here and just connect

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.689 
around the frames here and just connect
it<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> mainframe<00:00:28.230> pull<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.310> thing<00:00:29.490> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it to the mainframe pull up thing you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
it to the mainframe pull up thing you
can<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> pickup<00:00:30.240> animals<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.900> yes

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
can make a pickup animals and yes

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.690 
can make a pickup animals and yes
transfer<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> go

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
transfer them to where you need to go

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.920 
transfer them to where you need to go
maybe<00:00:33.000> s<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.360> make<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> lot<00:00:33.719> longer

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
maybe s you can make it a lot longer

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
maybe s you can make it a lot longer
than<00:00:34.200> i<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.410> made<00:00:34.920> mind<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.790> make

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
than i have made mind you just to make

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
than i have made mind you just to make
it<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.120> further<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it go further what do you want to do it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
it go further what do you want to do it
only<00:00:37.829> goes<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.340> back<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.879> forth

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
only goes up and down and back and forth

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
only goes up and down and back and forth
it<00:00:42.390> doesn't<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:43.739> around<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it doesn't go all the way around like a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.479 
it doesn't go all the way around like a
316<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.570> i<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.320> computers<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.100> because

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
316 and i use computers for this because

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.209 
316 and i use computers for this because
a<00:00:47.520> lot<00:00:47.730> easier<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.219> red

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a lot easier than just to use the red

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.170 
a lot easier than just to use the red
wiring<00:00:50.610> frames<00:00:51.480> battery<00:00:51.960> boxes<00:00:52.850> fray<00:00:53.850> motors

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
wiring frames battery boxes fray motors

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.830 
wiring frames battery boxes fray motors
and<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.489> cobblestone<00:00:57.270> jacketed

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and this time is cobblestone jacketed

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
and this time is cobblestone jacketed
wire<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.710> rent<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.850> my<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.270> wire<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
wire and rent out my right wire for the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.740 
wire and rent out my right wire for the
connection<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:02.910> frames<00:01:03.180> instant<00:01:03.570> chest

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
connection and then frames instant chest

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
connection and then frames instant chest
down<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.890> split<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> real<00:01:06.030> quick

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
down here so we split just a real quick

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
down here so we split just a real quick
to<00:01:06.390> show<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:08.189> don't

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to show you what it does and I don't

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
to show you what it does and I don't
have<00:01:08.580> any<00:01:08.760> program<00:01:09.240> set<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
have any program set up for it I just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
have any program set up for it I just
use<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> red<00:01:10.560> pulses<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.310> set<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> side

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
use the red pulses that set out the side

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.560 
use the red pulses that set out the side
signal<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> basically<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.570> signal

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
signal for it and basically this signal

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
signal for it and basically this signal
here<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.540> motion<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here is the up motion so to get the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.560 
here is the up motion so to get the
emotions<00:01:20.970> we're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> set<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> red<00:01:21.869> pulse

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
emotions we're going to set a red pulse

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.859 
emotions we're going to set a red pulse
up<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> side<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
up to the side one time and as you can

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
up to the side one time and as you can
see<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.110> pulled<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> its<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
see it pulled in one its kind of

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
see it pulled in one its kind of
machines<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.939> showing<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.270> frames<00:01:30.600> right

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
machines not showing these frames right

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.460 
machines not showing these frames right
here<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.880> pulls<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
here but it pulls it up one and on the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
here but it pulls it up one and on the
other<00:01:34.530> side<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.460> did<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> exact<00:01:36.060> opposite

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
other side so we did the exact opposite

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090 
other side so we did the exact opposite
except<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:37.979> because

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
except you set out on the right because

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010 
except you set out on the right because
it's<00:01:38.400> lined<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it's lined up with the right on the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's lined up with the right on the
cobblestone<00:01:40.470> jack<00:01:40.650> o'dwyer<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.970> pushes

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
cobblestone jack o'dwyer and it pushes

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.590 
cobblestone jack o'dwyer and it pushes
it<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:43.670> put<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> red<00:01:44.909> falls<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> right

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it down put the red falls to the right

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.679 
it down put the red falls to the right
one<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.210> pushes<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> back

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
one and you can see it pushes it back

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990

of it which where is where the frame
motor<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.989> located<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.770> going<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.950> push

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100

it pushes it up and down it's not

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.340 
it pushes it up and down it's not
grabbing<00:06:45.150> onto<00:06:45.390> that<00:06:45.570> frame<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:46.080> it's<00:06:46.200> not

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
grabbing onto that frame and it's not

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.850 
grabbing onto that frame and it's not
stalling<00:06:46.700> so<00:06:48.050> yeah<00:06:51.080> remember<00:06:52.080> battery<00:06:52.500> boxes

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
stalling so yeah remember battery boxes

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.280 
stalling so yeah remember battery boxes
power<00:06:53.070> the<00:06:53.280> frames<00:06:53.550> that's<00:06:54.510> basically<00:06:54.840> we<00:06:55.200> can

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
power the frames that's basically we can

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:04.040 
power the frames that's basically we can
go<00:06:55.380> through<00:06:55.700> boundary<00:07:02.390> since<00:07:03.390> this<00:07:03.540> lifts<00:07:03.960> it

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
go through boundary since this lifts it

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.600 
go through boundary since this lifts it
up<00:07:08.720> and<00:07:09.720> we<00:07:09.870> read<00:07:10.080> post<00:07:10.350> is<00:07:10.680> to<00:07:10.890> send<00:07:11.100> out<00:07:11.220> a<00:07:11.250> a
