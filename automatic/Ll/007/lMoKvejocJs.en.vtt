00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.200
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.910
 Thank you in advance The theme of today is here 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.549
 How to get involved 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.590
 I would like to introduce this is Chinese 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.910
 In the inclusion serve that a certain player is using 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.750
 It is hard to read by the person whose rotation is very difficult to understand 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.260
 I would like to share with you the way of motion 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.920
 So this way everyone 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.870
 Moreover, it can only be used for entrainment serve 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.199
 Because it is the way of motion, it is really the rotation of other serve 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.350
 Because it is impossible to do that motion 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.559
 Using this motion makes it very difficult for the other person to read 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:01:18.390
 It is easy to feel that you do not get used to it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 Way of entrapment serve which rotation does not understand 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.969
 It can be done in just one step 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.009
 First of all, your usual entrainment serve 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 I set up a normal roll serve or racket 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.260
 It doesn't matter if it's a vertical roll server 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.840
 Normal Roll Up Vertical Roll Up Serve 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.159
 Please do not have this attitude either 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.869
 The bottom of the racket faces up at the moment of rubbing 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.789
 Please try to say 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.640
 When you say what it means, it's the moment you get caught 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.070
 I'm pointing the racket to the ceiling like this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.429
 Let's go to the ceiling at the moment you hang it up 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.700
 It's like this, with normal roll-in serve 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.670
 The racket's foreside is immediately above the sky at the moment it is hung 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.870
 I'll head straight up 1-2 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.870
 1-2 1-2 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.900
 1-2, so put it sideways and go straight down and turn to heaven 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 I can not understand this surface rotation well 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.230
 At the moment of rubbing, the face of the racket immediately 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.959
 When it is raised above the ceiling and directed to the ceiling 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.930
 I'm a bit out of sync with serving 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.129
 It's vertical and it's same with serve 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.519
 Serve and hang vertically in the same way 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.709
 Let's hang the ceiling 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.739
 Let's hang and hang 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.159
 So hang it up 1-2 it's 1-2 more racket face 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.470
 If you put the motion of pointing to the ceiling 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.260
 I can not understand the rotation just by doing 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 I do not know at all whether it is side down or side up 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.939
 If you feel like turning to the ceiling at the moment of rubbing 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:20.189
 The tip is going ahead, it's entwined and rubbed 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.980
 It will be this if you try to face the ceiling 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.349
 I feel like the tip is going towards the other party 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.000
 It is such a feeling It is such a feeling 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.299
 By doing this, the rotation is further 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.860
 I can not understand the rotation of the more involved serve 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.200
 Top players in China will feel this way 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:52.049
 Confusing the rotation well 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.980
 This is the feeling of the racket 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.900
 I'm not going to point at the ceiling 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.480
 In the case of the other serve, it is said that the lower rotation makes the surface 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.019
 It is not possible to face the ceiling and the surface of the horizontal system 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.519
 It's hard to make, and it's pretty entwined 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.560
 How to use motion only 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.220
 I took advantage of this unique way of rubbing 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.630
 In the moment of rubbing with the same momentum 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.900
 Just turn the surface to the ceiling 1-2 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.590
 1-2 1-2 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.199
 1-2 1-2 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.220
 In the way 1-2 1-2 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.100
 If you do, you will finally see this side 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.210
 Where is your opponent hit? 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.710
 I do not know exactly where I made the rotation 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.041
 The other party receives while thinking that the reaction matches the other party 

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.050
 I'll do it for you 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.500
 There will be a lot of receive and match receive 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.210
 If you bring the serve together 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.560
 As it is easy to beat, there is a chance to stop there 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.000
 Or I feel like I can get a service ace 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.260
 It will be everyone by all means 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.060
 Because it is how to put the motion peculiar to the entanglement serve 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.819
 How to put out the last face of this racket 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.560
 This is the last one to turn to heaven 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.800
 The other party is not used because it is not used 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.660
 I think that it works very much To everyone's involvement serve 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.039
 I'm going to point the side of the racket to the ceiling right away 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.889
 Thank you for adding it in a moment
