words to refer to changeable data the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.120 
words to refer to changeable data the
way<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.099> create<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.460> variable<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.059> rebel<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:13.130> you

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
way we create a variable in rebel is you

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.550 
way we create a variable in rebel is you
take<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> word<00:00:14.700> any<00:00:15.030> set<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.870> characters<00:00:16.410> that

you want to use in this case I'm going
to<00:00:18.060> create<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> variable<00:00:19.080> called<00:00:19.350> picture<00:00:19.859> I'm

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to create a variable called picture I'm

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
to create a variable called picture I'm
going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> use<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> refer<00:00:21.359> some<00:00:22.289> data<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.560> I

that type of data double doesn't care
but<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.790> your<00:04:03.910> programming<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:05.349> want<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> be

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
but in your programming you want to be

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.490 
needs what you're referring to with the
variable<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:12.910> it's<00:04:13.030> helpful<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.470> use<00:04:14.470> a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
variable so it's helpful to use a

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.469

descriptive word in this case on number

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.580 
descriptive word in this case on number
refers<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.049> number<00:04:18.660> print<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.750> number<00:04:20.229> and

refers to a number print that number and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.820 
refers to a number print that number and
put<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.919> into<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.160> GUI<00:04:21.519> we<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.080> do<00:04:23.080> computations

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
put it into a GUI we can do computations

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.880 
put it into a GUI we can do computations
with<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.250> we<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.090> use<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.479> as<00:04:25.780> if<00:04:26.289> we're<00:04:26.680> typing

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
with it we can use it as if we're typing

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.450 
with it we can use it as if we're typing
in<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.550> number<00:04:28.830> if<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.950> want<00:04:29.979> to<00:04:30.160> change<00:04:30.280> it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
in that number if you want to change it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
in that number if you want to change it
later<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.270> change<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.630> number<00:04:31.780> something

later and change that number something

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.930 
later and change that number something
else<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:32.650> you'll<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.520> change<00:04:33.729> any<00:04:33.880> of

our code print that number again it will

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.570 
our code print that number again it will

put<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:53.599> rebel<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.080> now<00:04:54.370> wherever<00:04:55.370> we

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
put that and rebel and now wherever we

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.350 
put that and rebel and now wherever we
use<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.120> word<00:04:56.680> competition<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:59.120> going<00:04:59.300> to

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
use the word competition it's going to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.550 
use the word competition it's going to
give<00:04:59.509> us<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:01.220> number<00:05:01.639> that's<00:05:01.789> going<00:05:01.909> to<00:05:02.060> sign

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.499 

that's<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:07.520> course<00:05:07.759> we<00:05:07.849> can<00:05:07.970> change<00:05:08.150> that

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
that's it of course we can change that

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:15.480 
that's it of course we can change that
value<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:12.289> now<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.009> we'd<00:05:13.190> like<00:05:13.479> reassign<00:05:14.479> it

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
value and now so we'd like reassign it

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.129 
value and now so we'd like reassign it
little<00:05:16.490> sign<00:05:16.669> some<00:05:16.970> text<00:05:19.539> now<00:05:20.539> whenever<00:05:20.900> we

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
little sign some text now whenever we

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.409 
little sign some text now whenever we
use<00:05:21.379> that<00:05:21.680> new<00:05:22.460> value<00:05:22.909> for<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.240> word

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
use that new value for the word

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:31.990 
use that new value for the word
computation<00:05:28.000> give<00:05:29.000> us<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.330> new<00:05:29.479> value<00:05:31.000> again

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
computation give us the new value again
