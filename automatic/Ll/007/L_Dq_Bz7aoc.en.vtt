so<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.020> thought<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:21.590> was<00:05:21.680> pretty<00:05:21.919> neat

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070

because if you're playing on your phone

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.600 
because if you're playing on your phone
you're<00:05:24.140> gonna<00:05:24.200> have<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.560> pause<00:05:24.770> many<00:05:25.160> more

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
you're gonna have to pause many more
