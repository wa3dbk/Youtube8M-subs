has<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:16.380> than<00:01:16.560> Jon<00:01:16.920> Favreau<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> first

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
two and I don't necessarily mean that I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
two and I don't necessarily mean that I
like<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> throw<00:01:21.299> him<00:01:21.420> better<00:01:21.780> than<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> first

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
like to throw him better than the first

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
like to throw him better than the first
one<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.920> think<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> Iron<00:01:23.700> Man<00:01:23.939> 3<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> definitely

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
one I think the Iron Man 3 is definitely

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
one I think the Iron Man 3 is definitely
better<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:24.930> iron<00:01:25.170> man<00:01:25.380> 2<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.799> most

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
better than iron man 2 I think most

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.109 
better than iron man 2 I think most
people<00:01:26.280> could<00:01:26.430> agree<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> because

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
people could agree with that because

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
people could agree with that because
there<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.049> wouldn't<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:29.040> into<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.430> was

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

I'd say that I really liked the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
I'd say that I really liked the
direction<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> mean<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

some continuity issues with the comics
which<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.630> upsetting<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.800> Marvel

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
which is upsetting because the Marvel

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.010 
which is upsetting because the Marvel
Cinematic<00:04:48.310> Universe<00:04:48.760> has<00:04:49.150> done<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.750> far<00:04:49.960> I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
these ideas from the comics in such a

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.850 
these ideas from the comics in such a
great<00:04:56.410> way<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.150> shame<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.450> they<00:04:58.990> did

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
great way it's a shame that they did

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.790 
great way it's a shame that they did
something<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.490> feel<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.680> against<00:05:02.680> the

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
something that I feel is so against the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.470 
something that I feel is so against the
comics<00:05:03.250> since<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.550> Mandarin<00:05:04.000> is<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:04.450> of

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480

comics since the Mandarin is like one of
the<00:05:04.570> oldest<00:05:05.200> Iron<00:05:05.500> Man<00:05:05.590> fillings<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.310> felt

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
the oldest Iron Man fillings and I felt

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.130 
the oldest Iron Man fillings and I felt
like<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.640> was<00:05:06.850> kind<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.240> slap<00:05:07.810> in<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.050> face

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
like this was kind of a slap in the face

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.810 
like this was kind of a slap in the face
to<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.950> don't<00:05:09.340> know<00:05:09.430> what<00:05:09.640> they<00:05:09.760> were

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
thinking maybe Shane Black thought this

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.600
