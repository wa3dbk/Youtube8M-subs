00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with more heart than perhaps you would

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
with more heart than perhaps you would

time<00:00:58.500> given<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.070> added<00:00:59.280> 30<00:00:59.460> minutes<00:00:59.930> I<00:01:00.930> think

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
time given that added 30 minutes I think

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.689 
time given that added 30 minutes I think
the<00:01:01.800> priority<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.219> always<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> league

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the priority was always the league

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
the priority was always the league
always<00:01:03.090> Saturday<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:04.290> always

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
