00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
thing I did was made the Oval wide felt

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.580 
thing I did was made the Oval wide felt
like<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:23.750> a<00:00:24.750> color<00:00:27.140> probably<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.289> color

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
like that in a color probably that color

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
like that in a color probably that color
and<00:00:29.779> next<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.439> make<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> circle<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:33.590> its

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and next thing is make a circle for its

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
and next thing is make a circle for its
I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520 

think<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:43.560> black

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.799 

felt<00:00:48.160> like<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:52.239> going<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.420> start

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
felt like that then we're going to start

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.029 
felt like that then we're going to start
making<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:54.370> bunch<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.860> outlined<00:00:56.860> oval<00:00:57.640> wides<00:00:59.039> so

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
making a bunch of outlined oval wides so

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.859 
making a bunch of outlined oval wides so
do<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:02.909> get<00:01:03.909> a<00:01:03.940> good<00:01:04.180> angle<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:07.420> them<00:01:07.600> black

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
do that get a good angle make them black

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:29.270 
do that get a good angle make them black
and<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.990> keep<00:01:11.229> duplicating<00:01:11.440> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 

you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.119> mess<00:01:30.299> around<00:01:30.330> with<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.460> see

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you can just mess around with it see

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.039 
you can just mess around with it see
which<00:01:32.610> angles<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.659> best<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> mask

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
which angles you like best for the mask

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:54.860
