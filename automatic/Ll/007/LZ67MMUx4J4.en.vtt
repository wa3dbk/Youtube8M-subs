creative ones and my parents always we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.390 
creative ones and my parents always we
don't<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.250> from

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
don't know where you get that from

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
don't know where you get that from
because<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.850> didn't<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
because they didn't have it so you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.480 
because they didn't have it so you
figure<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> has<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.430> birth

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
figure it has to come from my birth

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.719 
figure it has to come from my birth
family<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.830> curiosity<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> why

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
family so I had that curiosity of why

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
family so I had that curiosity of why
again<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.229> your

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350

parents<00:01:16.380> look<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.430> forth<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.970> always

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
