00:00:02.494 --> 00:00:03.671
 Hello, everyone. 

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:04.838
 I am Qiu Meining. 

00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:14.283
 I think spring and summer are the best match. 

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:16.784
 Should be a hat and a headscarf 

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:19.121
 Then because it is spring and summer 

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.205
 I think everyone will have something like a straw hat. 

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:24.701
 Then the most important thing is that this is more basic 

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:26.189
 But I think these basic words 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859
 The above is still to have some details 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.873
 Because it is what I personally like 

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:32.986
 It’s a bit natural and a little elegant 

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.609
 So actually my straw hat will look for some 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.647
 Is probably a little bit of a little Lady's elements 

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:42.735
 If you don’t have a headband, you don’t need to feel too exaggerated. 

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:43.922
 Would feel a bit strange 

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:46.785
 Because your lower body is more casual and more natural. 

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.447
 Then your headgear is the opposite 

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:52.174
 May be a big block 

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:56.965
 Or it will mix some of the more high-profile elements 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.148
 Then let me introduce you to the wearing of the headscarf. 

00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:03.698
 Then this is a turban I designed. 

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.061
 What is special about it is that there is a small hole here. 

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.748
 You are good at your own head shape first. 

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:12.436
 Or a location you want to go to 

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:17.992
 When you find it, you have to stuff the extra stuff first. 

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:21.162
 Then you find the location you want 

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:23.038
 You have to tighten it a little more 

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:24.487
 Probably like this 

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:25.912
 But basically it should not be lost. 

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:28.850
 But if it would be someone who would want to go out and dance 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.967
 Maybe it’s just like to clip two hairpins. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.713
 I think everyone should be easier to find a big square like this 

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.950
 This kind of scarf is a must for summer and winter. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.863
 The first is to fold a triangle 

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:49.159
 Then fold it in half 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.913
 Then turn over and fold 

00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:52.963
 Fold this way 

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:55.424
 Probably the size of a long strip like this 

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:59.324
 Then the side without such creases is outside 

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:05.139
 Then you can tie a very simple method 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.794
 I personally feel like this is a bit too low in age. 

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:12.265
 So I will put it in and put it in 

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.163
 Then will show one side 

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:16.639
 It’s up to you to see what your own print looks like. 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.477
 But I just like it, here is to expand it a little bit. 

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:22.578
 Like this 

00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:26.077
 This way, you are wearing a t-shirt. 

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:28.765
 You can all go out... 

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:29.532
 played
