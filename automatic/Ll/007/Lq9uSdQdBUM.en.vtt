00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 they are between 17 and 22 years old each 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.219
 Friday they can be more of a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.219
 hundred plus industrialists 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.310
 they are stains fans you 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.809
 disapproval of wheel and ron 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.390
 races in one against one on short 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.700
 distance he practice their discipline in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.570
 any illegality on a portion of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.980
 road open to traffic 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.329
 whether they are aware of it or not 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.329
 risk their lives every moment 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.630
 there it starts to a lot shot so there 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.640
 there is traffic that can very 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.810
 arrived safely 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.750
 danda back up a delay that goes down the 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.160
 minimum but it is to prevent them 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.830
 to avoid accidents 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.129
 probable at the arrival of the police the game 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.610
 stop immediately at least for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.610
 moments 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.070
 I have against when I see them 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.570
 get to bottom on the rear wheel with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.910
 gear or brakes to 100 museums or 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.290
 it is not always in state it is on these 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 two I think first of all about their safety 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 because we are here for their 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 security 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 fear is the key word the phenomenon 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 is taken very seriously by the police 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.330
 we have a number of killed this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.700
 year on the biker roads 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.690
 so the latest one 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.670
 presumably it was a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.260
 run on the docks in the picture so we 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.700
 try to limit a little bit and do 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.960
 to make people aware of the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 danger of 2 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.690
 speed but the renault continues 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.010
 every Friday the evening is 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.840
 turns into a game of cat and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.250
 mouse with the police 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080
 after the rue des combes using north 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.659
 young people go to a new spot 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.790
 illegal him too no thugs not 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.500
 savages these boys created their 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.410
 association almost two years ago 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.300
 runners 87 not for the purpose of 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.670
 promote their sport but in that of 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.210
 practice it legally and therefore 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 safely 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.060
 greenpeace it's expensive I think 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.470
 money from the municipality 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 it's better elsewhere than in a chip 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 that's for sure but block a road like 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.720
 that would not be bad but we can 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.650
 make deviations are easily 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.319
 can block the road 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.910
 it would mean we do 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.830
 to legalize your discipline that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.850
 as would better secure the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 because there you do not have the cross 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.970
 red had nobody in the name does not have the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.770
 corruption does not have the acts and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 prefectural so for me to appeal to 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.700
 him for now but if we have what he 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.780
 must we hit the red cross 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.940
 we will put everything in place for good 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.160
 secure the place the town hall has pushed back 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.660
 the request to create a track for 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.010
 the moment the prefecture does not wish 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.390
 take a stop to block a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.780
 portion of road a few hours per 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.760
 week 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.739
 far from being considered outcasts 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.390
 young runners are supported by the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.280
 federation of angry bikers what 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.410
 I want you to listen to them and 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.050
 that finally we give them the opportunity to 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.950
 practice their passion safely 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.709
 with instruments the correct means 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.989
 ie a track a track where a 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.850
 where a stranded road where they 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.209
 will not risk their lives and that of 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.209
 other users 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.390
 the phenomenon has existed since the moc 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.540
 fixes several major cities have 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.610
 already solved the problem in 79 summer 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 inaugurated in tremblay in france the first 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.320
 circuit formalizing the discipline 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.180
 it is called circuit carole carole 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.890
 was like a young girl from Rennes who 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 campaigned for a closed runway 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.760
 she killed herself on the ring 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.760
 Parisian before you can enjoy it
