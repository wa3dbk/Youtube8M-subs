00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello to all guys and welcome back on 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.300
 own investigators and welcome to this new one 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.219
 video in which we want to satisfy those 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 which are your ones that have been 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.670
 your major requests in the last 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 video yes in the last video you have us 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 asked many gaming configurations 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 especially the 800 900 euro range 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.359
 in this particular video we want 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.460
 offer you two configurations a party from 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 the most requested one from 800 euros and one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.020
 since the twentieth century we have customized 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.239
 us for better performances yes 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.980
 please for makeup but let's start with right away 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 the 800 configuration let's start right away 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 with our configuration taking 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.710
 examining the soul of our computer 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 the one that gives life to everything 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.840
 to the power supply in this case we have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.780
 chosen for both configurations a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 thermaltake bear lindsay 130 watts is a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.940
 last feeder from the absurd lost of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.770
 45 euros which also has a certification e 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.329
 for what we need to do more than 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.489
 enough 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.010
 let's go straight to the tevez in a row 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 mother who is hard disk and we treat them 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.939
 quickly because we already have it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 spoken the last 650 configuration 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.000
 EUR 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.250
 in particular we chose lacquer 87 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 hard rock fatality like video 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 previous as motherboard 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 the 200r always rides of the race the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.820
 which is our favorite brand for 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.430
 regarding the keys and the western 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 digital caviar blue from an entire sail 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479
 They were quick to say that they are the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.180
 best quality price hardly yes 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 find alternatives at the lowest price 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
 is what really in the mirror 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.909
 as for the heart of the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 our computer the beating heart e 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.970
 therefore the processor we have chosen for 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.000
 the 800 euro 15 46 and 70 configuration 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.040
 yes we chose inter and not md why 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.840
 according to us enel is saving 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 energy that optimization e 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 core performance and also for the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.149
 intel chipset 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.830
 we prefer than me to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.170
 despite he has see 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.420
 as for associated with 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 our processor the heat sink that you don't 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 we put stock are in mind not done 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.970
 we chose a 20 euro solution 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 of the artic the freeze 7 pro 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.010
 red two yes it is not a mega heat sink it is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 great for what it does not so much 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 we have to clock temperatures not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.010
 they will be elevated and therefore it is 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.050
 decent enough for that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.850
 what we have to do as we were boys 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.840
 have chosen kingston technology 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.150
 out of 1866 two 4-gb banks per 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.380
 take advantage of the dual channel 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.810
 absolutely we chose these 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 ham because with the arm processor 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 of the memo the new generation of 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.420
 intel 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.940
 this frequency 1866 results 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.620
 decidedly more powerful than the 1600's 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 we chose in the previous videos if 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 it is perhaps not so much more for a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.970
 this price of 61 euros is worth as much for 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.830
 so here we go or guys to the point of 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 fire the choice of the video card 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.930
 we wanted to give you two alternatives for 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 do not get caught by draw to avoid one 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.700
 gpu un amd is obviously a nvidia like 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.060
 md we chose a r 92 80 hicks 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.370
 safire click on one side while instead 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.840
 like nvidia we chose a gigabyte 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.040
 Version oci 770 prices of 280 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.459
 we bought on amazon and 276 sugi 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.350
 com 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.180
 with regard to envy the choice 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.700
 guys the cards are anyway 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250
 almost similar should be more 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.080
 powerful nvidia at fps level but also 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.910
 md and a lot for saints so we leave you 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.480
 the one chosen to avoid just doing 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.640
 damage 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.500
 this gpu configuration remains 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 also in the second pc configuration 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.010
 that we are now going to propose them and there 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.500
 we remember that the first part we have it 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.940
 made up ok 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.130
 let's move on to our configuration 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.019
 today from 900 euros 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.720
 exact in the case then in the future you want 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.490
 best 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.920
 performance of your pc by giving a 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.720
 processor reel thrust in particular 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.850
 comparison to the previous configuration 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.280
 we obviously changed the pieces like 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 motherboard ram processor e 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.060
 heat sink obviously foreign but 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.770
 structural so let's see how 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.160
 motherboard boys we chose one 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.260
 slot z 87 extreme4 excellent card for a 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.330
 overclock not exaggerated but 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.580
 an excellent card has some excellent phases of 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.690
 supply of the price of 111 euros is 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.980
 tempting 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.750
 obviously this card is to be associated 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.610
 at 46 70 always in 5 k this time with 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.470
 unlocked multiplier is the only one 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.860
 difference you find at a price of 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.600
 221 euros while we wanted as a branch 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.160
 change take some ram a little 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.140
 best to those that are those 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.460
 of the other configuration by choosing them 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.700
 g.skill ares always at 1.866 megahertz e 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.710
 with less latency, a cl9 is always 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.150
 two banks of four to take advantage of the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.680
 dual channel 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.600
 obviously for a configuration from 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.060
 overclocking could not miss even a 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.740
 change of sink we will move more 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.930
 on the noctua that has decidedly more 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.840
 reliable more loaned to give to the top to the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.270
 nh d14 harry is and remains the top and lost 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.000
 80 euros destroys any desire to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.800
 warm up your processor there are 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.030
 even the ajo heatsinks but not them 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.820
 we have inserted because obviously i 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.680
 prices rise dramatically 700 euros but in the 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.320
 case there are some classic courses 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.350
 masses the swift and kakÃ  220 that breaks of 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.350
 ugly 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.790
 these are our configurations ed 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.200
 800 900 the moment I have a redemptions 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.360
 blogs that overclock 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.130
 but there is another way another way 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.100
 to improve performance in 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.840
 absolute to the purchase of an ssd in 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.210
 particular with the prices they are 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.570
 increasingly falling and finding a samsung 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.100
 840 chievo has a price of 70 euros from 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.160
 120gb from 122 for the 240 we can not that 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.540
 do not advise you to enter yours 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.850
 we have not entered configurations of 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.290
 default because the same does not improve 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.300
 gaming performance decreases i 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.610
 uploads but is not a performance in 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.500
 the more you have no more fps it does not improve the 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.850
 speed so we didn't enter it 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.860
 default however we recommend it 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.600
 strongly than absolutely for one 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.280
 fluidity of eating system and for one 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.310
 total perfection of your computer 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.260
 it is necessary these girls are exact 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.330
 our configurations 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.880
 let us know what you think about it 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.170
 you appreciate us see you in the 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.170
 auburn hill configurations
