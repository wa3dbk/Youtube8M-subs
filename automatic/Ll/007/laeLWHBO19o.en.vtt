00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
this is an example right yeah so like

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.349 
this is an example right yeah so like
what<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.950> look<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.850> an<00:00:06.000> image

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
what is it that you look for in an image

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.419 
what is it that you look for in an image
that<00:00:06.660> or<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.740> an<00:00:07.950> image<00:00:08.220> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that or what is it about an image that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.370 
that or what is it about an image that
really<00:00:08.550> makes<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.179> gravitate<00:00:09.870> towards<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
really makes you gravitate towards it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.549 
really makes you gravitate towards it
and<00:00:10.620> okay<00:00:11.210> okay<00:00:12.210> well<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:13.200> what

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and okay okay well I think what

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.970 
and okay okay well I think what
interests<00:00:13.950> me<00:00:14.009> most<00:00:14.309> about<00:00:15.199> a<00:00:16.199> photograph

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
interests me most about a photograph

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.570 
interests me most about a photograph
that<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.190> haven't<00:00:17.400> seen<00:00:17.730> before<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that I haven't seen before is that it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.340 
that I haven't seen before is that it
takes<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.420> takes<00:00:21.689> me<00:00:21.869> somewhere<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
takes and it takes me somewhere I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.660 
takes and it takes me somewhere I
haven't<00:00:22.740> been<00:00:23.039> before

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
haven't been before

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330 
haven't been before
sometimes<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.560> particular<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.310> of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
sometimes that's a particular way of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.220 
sometimes that's a particular way of
seeing<00:00:26.760> sometimes<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.689> something<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.109> do

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
seeing sometimes it's something to do

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.560 
seeing sometimes it's something to do
the<00:00:28.349> subject<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> subject<00:00:29.910> but

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.179 
Isle book that we did together both in
Cuba<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.960> I've<00:01:03.960> always<00:01:04.439> loved<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.979> picture

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
Cuba and I've always loved this picture

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
Cuba and I've always loved this picture
I've<00:01:05.519> always<00:01:05.880> loved<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> notion<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I've always loved the notion of this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
I've always loved the notion of this
bird<00:01:07.170> flying<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.950> looking<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.850> he's<00:01:09.060> he's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bird flying off looking as if he's he's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
bird flying off looking as if he's he's
left<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.290> single-source<00:01:11.070> she<00:01:11.490> presumably<00:01:12.240> has

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
left a single-source she presumably has

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
left a single-source she presumably has
left<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:13.020> single<00:01:13.710> solitary<00:01:14.159> egg<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
left a single solitary egg you know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
left a single solitary egg you know
there's<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.430> sense<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.240> sort<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
there's also this sense of sort of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.120 
there's also this sense of sort of
freedom<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.710> flight<00:01:20.840> which<00:01:21.920> resonates<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
freedom and flight which resonates in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
freedom and flight which resonates in
many<00:01:23.310> ways<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.420> sense<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.020> Cuba<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
many ways with a sense of Cuba but you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.649 
many ways with a sense of Cuba but you
know<00:01:28.259> ultimately<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:29.729> regard<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> pictures

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
know ultimately with regard to pictures

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
know ultimately with regard to pictures
that<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.439> liked<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> end<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.950> can't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that I really liked in the end I can't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.749 
that I really liked in the end I can't
say<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.700> about<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> specific<00:01:37.170> picture

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
say too much about the specific picture

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.960 
say too much about the specific picture
because<00:01:38.869> if<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.020> could<00:01:40.229> say<00:01:40.409> too<00:01:40.470> much<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.369> it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because if I could say too much then it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
because if I could say too much then it
wouldn't<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.479> worth<00:01:42.600> having

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
wouldn't be worth having

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.429 
wouldn't be worth having
the<00:01:44.009> mystery<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.610> picture<00:01:45.060> law<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
the mystery of this picture law is

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.190 
the mystery of this picture law is
embedded<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:47.219> this<00:01:47.430> image<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
embedded in this image and that's what I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
embedded in this image and that's what I
like<00:01:49.380> about<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:51.799> ok<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:54.180> fear<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
like about it ok and I really fear the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.419 
like about it ok and I really fear the
pictures<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.829> Alex's<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
pictures and put a picture of Alex's in

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.850

that I I really find in some ways that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
that I I really find in some ways that
just<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.110> sense<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.470> wanting<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.890> spend<00:02:38.220> time

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
just the sense of wanting to spend time

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.000

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.660 
I said before like like any good call on
you<00:03:24.260> because<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.890> more<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.190> talk<00:03:25.340> about<00:03:25.400> it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
you because the more you talk about it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.490 
you because the more you talk about it
the<00:03:25.970> more<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.150> sort<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.390> falls<00:03:26.570> apart<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.320> it's

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the more it sort of falls apart so it's

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.520 
the more it sort of falls apart so it's
I<00:03:27.920> think<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.630> trusting<00:03:29.630> those<00:03:29.930> images

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530

I think it's just trusting those images
that<00:03:30.770> one<00:03:30.950> loves<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.550> leader<00:03:31.850> with<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.900> I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
that one loves to leader with it and I
