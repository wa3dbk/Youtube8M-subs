00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.500
 last community server video yes some 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 if something is shocked but it is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 Of course, just the last video from memic 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 map cell yes what is there to say 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 have now played over 60 days here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.470
 we have with wee little oldtimers 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 started here now 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.640
 really a huge hofmann sees 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 Already the game barely comes with the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 all machines and the map clear us 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.289
 have just accumulated so much 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 and i want this part easy now 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.780
 to say goodbye to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 this score is equal to you too 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 let's show the statistics because that is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.680
 really grapes are just a number 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 very shocking already and i find 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 really blatant what the community here everything 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.039
 Thanks a lot 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 also to marco the here almost always 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.039
 has taken care of everything to the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 whole boys who were here quite often 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:05.939
 at nico anupam did like money on wool 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 to marie of course marius to all the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.520
 So I probably have it now 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 some forgot too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
 but these are always the first ones 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 have come to that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 There were really many people here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.670
 will now continue on the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 bands mecklenburg western pomerania map da 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.780
 Will you be the first video tomorrow? 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 to get where we play on the map 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.750
 Here we play with realistic 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.320
 income so there is not that much 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.720
 harvest from your field down we drive 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 play with it really nice mods 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 everything so tug between 100 150 ps 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.759
 at the start and want us there too 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.799
 work your 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 the fields are even bigger in part 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.420
 For example, we have something thierfeld 88 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.729
 is this risk there we have one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 field that shine number 27 that has it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.100
 You can say about twice as big 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.509
 So it's really just me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 I have to say a little bit 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.579
 admonish what I do not think is good 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.829
 clearly something is something here so when you 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.570
 a leak happen but since then the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.490
 People knew that I change the map 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.780
 would like to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.969
 you really just want to make nonsense 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 and you can see it I would have now 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.170
 just by then it falls 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 partly a bit up 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 he did not want me that way now 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 Bad but there are a few here 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.340
 The simple real yes already 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 pretty close they are because everybody knows 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 should have fun with it here and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.930
 Just buck up with others here too 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.819
 play and then somehow the game 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.880
 I say sabotage and somehow 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.239
 to make nonsense is really just naughty 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.160
 and unnecessary and that will be in the future too 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.440
 a little different if you do 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.849
 Maybe we still remember it 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.500
 I was really very gracious 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.989
 Remind me of a person we are in 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.850
 We have banned these 60 days 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.739
 several times warnings kicked 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 but I will do it in the future 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.090
 handle on the bands that people the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
 Do not reset your machines 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.100
 Sort and warned 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.019
 become 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.549
 with a warning possibly with a 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.690
 second warning will then be maintained 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.340
 and then yes if something like that occurs several times 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.709
 can then lead to the tracks 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.360
 Of course there are situations there you can 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.220
 Just not something again 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.290
 but you should do that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.840
 really get used to the big crowd 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.120
 just like your machines a bit like that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.489
 to put it back as it should be 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.079
 because that's partly true he does it 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.390
 just no fun you want yourself 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.609
 come on server and do something 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.430
 stand first time 1000 machine on one 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.260
 partly banned the part have that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.299
 we already have 2 34 in the evening 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.370
 hours cleaned up before the self 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.049
 could start playing and that works 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.030
 Just not that should be now 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.680
 definitely change on the new map 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.780
 as I said there will be tomorrow 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 first video too but that's on everyone 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.510
 fall a topic which I address 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.100
 It would like to promise from now on 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.859
 all become more strict with it 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.780
 continue to enjoy the server 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.690
 I look at the statistics 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.180
 let's go in we start with 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.510
 the camp i think that could read 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.910
 we have over eight million melons 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.500
 very important for a server 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.840
 language to say eight melons so over 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.280
 eight million and in the field you have 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.079
 seen are still many mountains 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.880
 So it'll probably be a good ten 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.760
 We are millions of potatoes 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.209
 to have 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.310
 we have half a million hendl oats 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:26.040
 and we have 17 million hands 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.820
 that's really blatant enough 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.350
 grains mostly 700,000 that is for us 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.600
 I do not say anything anymore but that's it 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.160
 already something was torn in the 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.010
 This is unbelievable 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.620
 Storage has far more than 800 hours 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.150
 down that I find so amazing we 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.830
 have started here with the smallest 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.570
 what the game has to offer in common and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.070
 we really have it more than just in 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.770
 the top class managed that here already 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.870
 really everything at the highend level 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.190
 whole big john animal thresher 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.910
 in between 780 he 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.490
 we have some really renewal 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.630
 and i would like to see the next statistics 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.979
 open the page 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:09.389
 we have 1.3 million cows 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:12.389
 silage in stock we generally have a lot 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.190
 a lot of feed for those in stock 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.050
 I read put the now not before the 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.910
 I do not think so interesting what 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.270
 really interesting and what is 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.830
 So it really is incredible 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.160
 unbelievable you can see it differently 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.720
 a score scores the harvested area 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.760
 this server you have to say there was 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.960
 in between a savegame crash so there 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.210
 could something on it again 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:43.320
 blow 2700 hectares 2700 appliances area 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.270
 almost as much as 35 hectares 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.979
 less clear these are the fields 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.169
 that were sown in the beginning and so on 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.780
 It's really awesome what's here 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.949
 that was just done 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.630
 Respect for my job I have yes 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.520
 especially in the last week very much 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.960
 very much with played with a few 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.030
 We have some nights there 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.250
 gone through and put potatoes and 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.340
 everything and it was really it 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.880
 has real poke makes with you the case 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.190
 is dance we really go there 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.990
 44,000 kilometers too if you look at that 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.760
 let's think about the globe I've just got 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.190
 not in the head need to 40000 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.560
 be miles if you are almost in 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.710
 The circle around the earth drives by car 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.969
 if you come it over the 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.990
 we did that more than 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.290
 a kind around 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.540
 Customers we drove here with yes 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.310
 what our vehicles 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:41.280
 the most glaring number ever is we have 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:45.030
 322 1481 liters of diesel burned that is 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.040
 just a whole rig was allowed 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.910
 bathe a month from shed about that 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.630
 is just so sick and 855 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.000
 hours that's just yes I am 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.280
 proud of you we have 1.7 million 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.540
 at the moment , even if we have everything 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.140
 We would have sold 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.640
 probably 30 40 million 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.120
 sorry a little hiccup 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.250
 Degree 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.920
 at all the big numbers here 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.110
 Do you ever get nervous ? I have to say 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.640
 It was a lot of fun for me 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.180
 There were hardly any situations that affected me 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.650
 have also disturbed a server team 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.570
 and now it's often on the bands 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.550
 Mecklenburg hopefully still 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.620
 more successful the map is also one 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.750
 a little better for weak pcs so 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.520
 at flamingos and marco is there me 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.150
 bin grad in ts space that is just a 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.340
 a little stupid 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:39.120
 Hopefully, nothing else says otherwise 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.980
 he announced himself again shortly 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.130
 he often does not know that now 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.800
 someone hello halli hello hears me 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:50.100
 So just you do not care, we maintain 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.170
 us then but yes on the bands 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.790
 it continues with titanium of the dlc 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.080
 this time because we just too 

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.270
 times the devices want to use and 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.710
 Titanium DLC around most of the others 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.070
 I let them down because they are not 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.660
 quite as popular and widespread 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.460
 yes, but I 'm looking forward to any event 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.960
 right on tomorrow if we then the 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.850
 see first part on the new map 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.290
 the site can already be up to date 

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.370
 the servers are played and you can too 

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.860
 myself again on the server 

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.450
 come and so on, but in any case 

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.670
 a huge thank you for your faithfulness 

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:20.120
 and see you again tomorrow 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.120
