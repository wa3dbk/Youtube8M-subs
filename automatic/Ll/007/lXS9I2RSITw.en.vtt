00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.461
 And now the gag is about the Ballon d'Or. Translation and Subtitles: Prophet for ForcaBarca.sk 

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.471
 Please note that we filmed it before the winners were announced. 

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:13.051
 To see the gag in which Messi wins, press the star on your remote control. 

00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:17.731
 It doesn't work because it's already filmed, but at least you can try it! 

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.561
 "The time has come to declare the winner. 

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:38.101
 And the winner of the Ballon d'Or 2012 is ... "" Yes, give it to me, I don't have all day for it. 

00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:49.101
 Thank you for this award. The truth is, I didn't expect it. 

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.501
 Well, I expected it because I win every year. 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.801
 I'd like to donate it to my playmate, Vill, who never plays for me. 

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:06.801
 And the rest of my speech is the same as every year. 

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.509
 Well thank you. Good by one year. 

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:20.011
 By the way, could you take part in the gala on January 8th? I don't have time to play with toys. [in Spain on January 6] 

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:25.701
 Thank you. "" Please, please! You haven't opened the envelope yet! How do you know Messi is there? " 

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:27.751
 "He is right. 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.801
 And the winner of the Ballon d'Or 2012 is ... " 

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.601
 "Damn it! 

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:43.801
 But I won't be crying ... " 

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:06.561
 We also shot a gag in which Cristiano won, as we wanted to be accurate and keep a 30 minute break. 

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.801
 This is a movie! 

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:17.601
 "And the winner of the Ballon d'Or 2012 is ... (I don't know why I open it when everyone knows there is Messi anyway)" 

00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:22.801
 "What?" 

00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.001
 "Take it! Take it !! 

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:34.811
 Get off that hoarse, you spoil the shot. 

00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.801
 Good evening. 

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:47.701
 But she's not as good as me, with my ABS, my quad, my thighs, my eyebrows ... 

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:52.011
 Wait a moment. Where are you leaving? I'm not done yet. 

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.871
 Hey, you're angry because I won ... Fuck you! 

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:03.401
 Hey! Where's my spotlight? Spotlight, please! Unbelievable ... 

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.531
 This is not gold. The poor! " 

00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.501
 Hey, we did a version even if he won Iniesta. 

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:18.401
 "Listen, leave it. Everyone knows I'm not going to win. That's just it. It's better if you lose another gag." 

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:21.021
 "No, you're a winner. Look." 

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:31.271
 "What do I have to say now?" 

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:38.901
 "It's an emotional moment. He doesn't know what to say." "No. Even the screenwriter didn't expect it and wrote nothing to say it." 

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:42.801
 "Take it. The speech I prepared." 

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:47.831
 "Little poor thing! 

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:55.431
 Well, the truth is, I'm excited and you can cut the video whenever you want. 

00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.401
 That's enough. "Translation and Subtitles: Prophet for ForcaBarca.sk
