00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.779
 Hi everyone, I am a roxy and today I am 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 I will show my tricks to make up i 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.410
 my eyes that are halfway between the ditches 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.809
 and with the drooping eyelid then like 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 see my mobile eyelid is almost 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 totally hidden from the fixed one that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 when the eyes at 20 c falls 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 practically on if you have eyes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 just like me you don't have to see it as a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 defect but simply understand that it is 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 one of the many types of eye 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 and as the other types need 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 of some tricks to be 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.880
 best exploited the first enemy 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.940
 of sunken eyes or eyelid 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.060
 it is the sweat that inevitably forms 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.020
 in the crease ruining your make up 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.980
 to avoid this we must use a primer 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.980
 extend it over the entire eyelid 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.250
 then we need a powder to fix the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.200
 primer and make sure not to sweat 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.030
 too much in the crease of the eye during 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.910
 the day 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.060
 and I apply it abundantly like this e 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.880
 then remove the excess with a brush 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 now let's move on to the eyeshadow 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 better to choose a light color e 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.030
 glittery for the eyelid 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.970
 because this will make the eyelid mobile 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 more visible and will make it seem more 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 wide 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.990
 after which to make it appear instead 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 less large and protruding fixed eyelid 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.980
 we choose a darker color and it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.069
 we are going to apply over the fair 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.410
 concentrating on the upper part 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.080
 this one here and try not to come down 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:32.760
 trunk sideways to prevent it from appearing 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:35.910
 the eye more saggy then fade well 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.570
 well upwards with a movement a 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570
 semicircle 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.499
 now to make the eye look even more 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.629
 big and lively 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:08.689
 take a flesh-colored pencil or 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.969
 ivory and we apply it in the corner 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.969
 inside and in the inner rim of the eye 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.910
 if you put her liner you have to remember 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:28.540
 one to do the stretch up until and 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.160
 two to apply it only by half the eye 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.840
 to the outside 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.970
 because if you put it also in the corner 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.890
 inside that little bit of mobile eyelid 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.220
 visible to completely disappear another 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.620
 what is that if you have a drooping eyelid 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.410
 unfortunately you cannot pull the stretch 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.380
 of the eyeliner because it disappears in the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:55.800
 fold but you have to follow the line of the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.800
 lower rhyme and go almost straight 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:15.090
 finally regarding the mascara 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.250
 use a water blue because if you have the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.949
 sunken eyes like me a lot 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.120
 probably your eyelashes touch you 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.030
 upper eyelid 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.900
 and if the mascara is not equal bru then vi 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.070
 leave all marked but apart from that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.120
 abound both on the upper lashes and 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.120
 on the lower ones 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:05:00.090
 and here is the final result another 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:05.460
 trick is to pull up the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:09.319
 hair at the temples let's say and see 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.319
 as also the eyes go upwards 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.620
