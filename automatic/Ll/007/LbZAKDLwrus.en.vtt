where I needed to sew and now the next

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.650 
where I needed to sew and now the next
step<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:03.130> take<00:04:03.310> out<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.730> sewing<00:04:04.090> pins<00:04:04.360> and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
step is to take out the sewing pins and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.360 
step is to take out the sewing pins and
put<00:04:04.930> them<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.350> your<00:04:05.440> print<00:04:05.680> cushion<00:04:06.010> or<00:04:06.190> just

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
put them away and then you're going to

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.530 
put them away and then you're going to
turn<00:04:08.260> your<00:04:08.800> clothes<00:04:09.160> inside<00:04:09.670> out<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.390> the

turn your clothes inside out so that the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.560 
turn your clothes inside out so that the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
good side is facing outward so here's

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.600 
good side is facing outward so here's
what<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.930> pajama<00:04:14.260> should<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.890> now<00:04:15.100> look<00:04:15.400> like

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
what the pajama should you now look like

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.390 
what the pajama should you now look like
and<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.020> time<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.440> make<00:04:17.590> any<00:04:17.830> changes

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and this is the time to make any changes

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400 
and this is the time to make any changes
if<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:18.940> decide<00:04:19.450> maybe<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.900> don't<00:04:20.080> like<00:04:20.230> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
if you decide maybe you don't like the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.500 
if you decide maybe you don't like the
long<00:04:20.590> sleeves<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.010> could<00:04:21.250> cut<00:04:21.430> them<00:04:21.580> down<00:04:21.760> but

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
long sleeves you could cut them down but

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.150 
long sleeves you could cut them down but

I actually really like how the long
sleeves<00:04:24.460> look<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.390> think<00:04:25.419> they're<00:04:25.720> really

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
sleeves look and I think they're really

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.230

nice<00:05:10.069> and<00:05:10.460> roomy<00:05:11.060> inside<00:05:11.509> so<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.050> don't<00:05:12.319> have<00:05:12.500> to

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
nice and roomy inside so I don't have to

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.480 
nice and roomy inside so I don't have to
make<00:05:13.699> or<00:05:14.060> put<00:05:14.690> on<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:15.020> velcro<00:05:15.500> as<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:16.370> guys

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.480 
make or put on the velcro as you guys
could<00:05:16.699> see<00:05:16.849> I<00:05:16.880> might<00:05:17.270> put<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:18.020> side<00:05:18.349> on<00:05:18.490> I

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
could see I might put this side on I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.010 
could see I might put this side on I
don't<00:05:19.699> really<00:05:19.909> know<00:05:20.090> what<00:05:20.270> side<00:05:20.569> I'm<00:05:20.780> going<00:05:20.930> to

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
don't really know what side I'm going to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.379 
don't really know what side I'm going to
use<00:05:21.319> but<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.220> don't<00:05:22.669> really<00:05:22.759> have<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.060> do<00:05:23.180> much

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389

use but I don't really have to do much
to<00:05:23.690> them<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:24.050> don't<00:05:24.110> think<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.440> actually<00:05:24.560> have<00:05:24.889> to

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.370 
to them I don't think I actually have to
do<00:05:25.220> anything<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.210> pants<00:05:26.599> I<00:05:26.750> could<00:05:27.229> just

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
do anything to the pants I could just

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.990 
do anything to the pants I could just
leave<00:05:27.500> them<00:05:27.680> how<00:05:27.830> they<00:05:27.979> are<00:05:28.130> that's<00:05:28.639> why<00:05:28.849> it's

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
leave them how they are that's why it's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.050 
leave them how they are that's why it's
good<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.300> check<00:05:29.720> before<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:31.310> start

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
good to just check before you start

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.060 
good to just check before you start
sewing<00:05:32.330> or<00:05:32.599> anything<00:05:32.750> like<00:05:32.990> that<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.740> pants

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
sewing or anything like that the pants

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.649 
sewing or anything like that the pants
were<00:05:34.159> actually<00:05:34.639> a<00:05:34.669> lot<00:05:35.030> easier<00:05:35.419> than<00:05:35.599> I

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
were actually a lot easier than I

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.330 
were actually a lot easier than I
thought<00:05:35.930> they<00:05:36.139> would<00:05:36.169> be<00:05:36.469> they<00:05:36.710> were<00:05:36.770> super

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
thought they would be they were super

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.249 
thought they would be they were super
easy<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:37.909> I<00:05:38.300> didn't<00:05:38.539> really<00:05:38.690> have<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.990> do<00:05:39.229> much

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
easy and I didn't really have to do much

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.760 
easy and I didn't really have to do much
else<00:05:39.919> when<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:40.370> finished<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:41.210> sewing<00:05:41.599> part<00:05:41.770> so

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770

if you do want to add velcro you could

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.899 
if you do want to add velcro you could
always<00:05:48.320> just<00:05:48.590> cut<00:05:48.889> a<00:05:48.919> little<00:05:49.159> slit<00:05:49.580> in<00:05:49.639> the

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
back and then add a velcro there but I

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.570 
back and then add a velcro there but I
didn't<00:05:53.659> have<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:54.020> do<00:05:54.139> that<00:05:54.320> luckily<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:55.340> now

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580

we're going to move on to the shirt
you're<00:05:57.560> going<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.770> choose<00:05:58.039> what<00:05:58.310> side<00:05:58.669> you

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
you're going to choose what side you

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.170 
you're going to choose what side you
want<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.690> use<00:06:00.319> as<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:01.340> front<00:06:01.639> of<00:06:01.789> the<00:06:01.909> shirt
