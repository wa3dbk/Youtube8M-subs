hi I'm rod from exchange and today we're
going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.269> take<00:00:06.479> a<00:00:06.510> look<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:06.990> set<00:00:07.769> of<00:00:07.859> roof<00:00:08.040> bars

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
going to take a look at set of roof bars

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.180 
going to take a look at set of roof bars
suitable<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.540> cars<00:00:09.839> with<00:00:10.379> roof<00:00:10.620> rails<00:00:10.919> like

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
suitable for cars with roof rails like

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.940 
suitable for cars with roof rails like
this<00:00:11.400> car<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:12.120> there<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.360> two<00:00:12.450> types<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.950> roof

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this car now there are two types of roof

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.949 
this car now there are two types of roof
rails<00:00:14.190> there's<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> open<00:00:15.150> type<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
rails there's the open type and the

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.260 
rails there's the open type and the
closed<00:00:16.410> type<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.340> open<00:00:17.730> type<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
closed type this is the open type that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.850 
closed type this is the open type that
means<00:00:18.450> basically<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.680> hand

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
means basically you can get your hand

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.140 
means basically you can get your hand
through<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:20.310> gap<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.070> closed<00:00:23.820> type

the on the bottle and you could damage

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.920 
the on the bottle and you could damage
them<00:03:29.020> so<00:03:30.020> taking<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.440> up<00:03:30.530> fully<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:32.480> position

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930
