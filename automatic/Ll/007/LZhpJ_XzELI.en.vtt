pulling it out as thin as I can pull it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
pulling it out as thin as I can pull it
because<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.229> nice

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.760 

all<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.310> got<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.550> do<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.910> do<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:44.620> you<00:01:45.620> can

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
all you got to do to do this as you can

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.890 
all you got to do to do this as you can
see<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.040> my<00:01:46.130> brush<00:01:46.460> if<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.600> pull<00:01:47.810> this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
see that my brush if I pull this

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.440 
see that my brush if I pull this
sideways<00:01:48.440> because<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.700> flat<00:01:49.970> shape<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.330> it

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
sideways because that flat shape of it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.180 
sideways because that flat shape of it
it's<00:01:50.570> going<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:50.960> fat<00:01:51.170> line<00:01:51.410> so<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:51.920> start

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
it's going to have a fat line so I start

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.090 
it's going to have a fat line so I start
pulling<00:01:52.370> it<00:01:52.520> sideways<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.210> pattern<00:01:54.110> line<00:01:54.260> so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
pulling it sideways see pattern line so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.530 
pulling it sideways see pattern line so
my<00:01:55.220> brush<00:01:55.400> always<00:01:55.640> stays<00:01:55.910> facing<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.360> same

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
my brush always stays facing the same

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.030 
my brush always stays facing the same
direction<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:57.170> order<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.410> get<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.800> pattern

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
direction in order to get that pattern

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.210 
direction in order to get that pattern
just<00:01:59.000> like<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.180> calligraphy<00:01:59.840> pen<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:01.040> know<00:02:01.160> you

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
just like a calligraphy pen you know you

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.040 
just like a calligraphy pen you know you
got<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.610> skinny<00:02:01.970> way<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.240> got<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.540> fat<00:02:02.870> way

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
got the skinny way you got the fat way

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.719 
got the skinny way you got the fat way
it<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.650> stays<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.010> same<00:02:04.040> direction<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it just stays the same direction the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.670 
it just stays the same direction the
whole<00:02:04.850> time<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.479> follow<00:02:05.780> suit<00:02:06.080> line<00:02:06.320> after

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
whole time just follow suit line after

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.300 
whole time just follow suit line after
line

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.680 

so<00:02:16.310> whatever<00:02:16.490> pattern<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.030> choose<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.420> use<00:02:17.540> I

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
so whatever pattern you choose to use I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.090 
so whatever pattern you choose to use I
mean<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.080> zigzag<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.710> line<00:02:18.890> all<00:02:19.070> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
mean you can zigzag that line all you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.060 
mean you can zigzag that line all you
want<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.420> go<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.660> over<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.080> place<00:02:21.290> as

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
want you can go all over the place as

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.890 
want you can go all over the place as
long<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.640> remember<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.420> keep<00:02:23.630> that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
long as you remember just keep that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.500 
long as you remember just keep that
brush<00:02:24.200> facing<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> same<00:02:25.130> way<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:26.300> that

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
brush facing the same way so that

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.000 
brush facing the same way so that
wherever<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.990> start<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:27.470> sideways<00:02:27.710> it's

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
wherever you start to go sideways it's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
wherever you start to go sideways it's
wider<00:02:28.330> wherever<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.420> start<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.690> pull<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> long

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
wider wherever you start to pull a long

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
wider wherever you start to pull a long
ways<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.620> stays<00:02:30.830> skinny<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.210> need<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
ways that stays skinny and you need to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.810 
ways that stays skinny and you need to
