00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.150
 This miraculous cube could help solve drinking problems in the 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.449
 To solve developing countries 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.039
 The idea for the patent comes from the Swiss circumnavigator Euro Wert and 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.829
 Niederrad 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.829
 was often in places where drinking water is advice 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.220
 1 Commerzbank has no access to clean people in the world every year 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.630
 water 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.010
 Polluted water causes diseases such as cholera and dysentery 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.780
 On one of his travels, the Swiss can get the idea how to look 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
 Clean water can do something clean 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.020
 the Mechernicher Bernhard Monz put the plans into action 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.750
 Pump out fathers steel and solar cells he built the prototype of the global 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.510
 team 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 a transportable water purifier 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.900
 the miracle will leave a cubic meter and weighs 600 pounds 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.950
 In a sewage treatment plant, the KIU Geertz must pass the acid test and from Claire 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.850
 Water Drinks Water Magic 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.620
 the broth in the clarifier contains a sip of billions of bacteria 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.350
 could be deadly 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.750
 with a few simple steps, the cube is ready to go 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.950
 the sides are coated with solar cells and now form a 5 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 Square meter area 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.810
 a windmill provides extra energy 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.480
 A total of 2500 watts of electricity can be generated in this way 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.990
 The last preparations for a suction pipe is constantly for replenishment 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 to care 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 then the test can begin 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 The cube should supply fresh water for 24 hours 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 the dirty water was initially in a collection container 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.020
 from there it goes in the bundle becomes 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 he turns the broth into clean drinking water 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.200
 Solar power drives a pump inside the cube 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.430
 she squeezes the dirty water through activated carbon filter the heavy metals and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.449
 Withhold chemicals 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 an eu decree did not kill any 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.589
 per day it will be able to process up to 2000 liters of water here 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.370
 whose qualities should soon be certified by the state 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:31.379
 The two Swiss inventors already have full confidence in their
