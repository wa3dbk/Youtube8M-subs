00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
do this the the lower packet is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:55.240 
do this the the lower packet is
balancing<00:01:49.660> somehow<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:52.310> balancing<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:54.250> on

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
balancing somehow it's balancing here on

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.760 
balancing somehow it's balancing here on
your<00:01:55.640> ring<00:01:56.210> finger<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.410> don't<00:01:57.620> really

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
need to worry about it falling out

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.880 
need to worry about it falling out
everything<00:02:00.110> should<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.410> balanced<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:02.600> that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
everything should be balanced like that

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.620 
everything should be balanced like that
it's<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.040> kind<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> awkward<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.250> now<00:02:07.630> with
