order to put this together you are going
to<00:00:48.059> end<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.329> using<00:00:48.840> PVC<00:00:49.500> cement<00:00:49.680> you're<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to end up using PVC cement you're going

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.260 
to end up using PVC cement you're going
to<00:00:51.180> apply<00:00:51.570> PVC<00:00:52.410> cement<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> inside<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to apply PVC cement to the inside of the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.799 
to apply PVC cement to the inside of the
inch<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> half<00:00:55.559> portion<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> bushing

insert your 2 foot lengths into that and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
insert your 2 foot lengths into that and
maybe<00:01:01.890> pound<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> ground<00:01:02.820> keep<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
maybe pound it down the ground keep it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
maybe pound it down the ground keep it
nice<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.570> straight<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.470> sure<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.920> get

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
nice and straight and make sure you get

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
nice and straight and make sure you get
it<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.080> once<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> have

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it all the way in there once you have

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
it all the way in there once you have
that<00:01:07.500> done<00:01:07.680> apply<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.130> PVC<00:01:08.549> cement<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that done apply your PVC cement on the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.100 
that done apply your PVC cement on the
inside<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.320> toilet<00:01:10.890> flange<00:01:11.960> take<00:01:12.960> your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
inside of your toilet flange take your

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
inside of your toilet flange take your
bushing<00:01:13.439> insert<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.970> sure

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bushing insert it in and make sure

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
bushing insert it in and make sure
you're<00:01:15.210> pushing<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.409> flat

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you're pushing down on a really flat

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
you're pushing down on a really flat
surface<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.600> making<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> stays

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
surface and making sure it stays

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
surface and making sure it stays
vertical<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.580> possible<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> have

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
vertical because it is possible to have

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.130 
vertical because it is possible to have
it<00:01:21.509> kinked<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.560> sideways<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:25.020> know

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it kinked a little sideways if you know

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
it kinked a little sideways if you know
it's<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> possible<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.939> keep<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.630> eye<00:01:27.720> out

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's just possible so keep an eye out

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
it's just possible so keep an eye out
for<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> try<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> make<00:01:28.920> sure<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
for that try to make sure it's a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940 
for that try to make sure it's a
vertical<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> ground<00:01:30.380> once<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.619> glued

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
vertical on the ground once that's glued

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370 
vertical on the ground once that's glued
you're<00:01:32.479> you're<00:01:33.479> essentially<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> portion

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you're you're essentially that portion

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.060 
you're you're essentially that portion
is<00:01:34.409> done<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.979> didn't<00:01:35.549> even<00:01:35.670> bother<00:01:35.850> gluing<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
is done I didn't even bother gluing the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.620 
is done I didn't even bother gluing the
coupler<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.250> didn't<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.090> point<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
coupler on didn't see any point in it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
coupler on didn't see any point in it
you'll<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.680> some<00:01:40.860> extra<00:01:41.040> holes<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you'll see some extra holes in it that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.590 
you'll see some extra holes in it that
was<00:01:41.850> me<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.000> testing<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.750> ideas<00:01:43.520> and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
was me just testing out some ideas and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
was me just testing out some ideas and
this<00:01:45.600> ended<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> best<00:01:46.530> option

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this ended up being the best option

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
this ended up being the best option
although<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.579> needed<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> drill<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> hole<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
although I needed to drill the hole a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.440 
although I needed to drill the hole a
little<00:01:48.750> bigger<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.890> anyways<00:01:50.729> once<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> have

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
little bigger but anyways once you have

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
little bigger but anyways once you have
that<00:01:51.720> it'll<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:53.299> flange<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.470> set

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that it'll take your flange you will set

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
that it'll take your flange you will set
it<00:01:56.040> flat<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.579> dolly<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it flat on your dolly now this is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
it flat on your dolly now this is
essentially<00:01:58.799> designed<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.310> dollies<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
essentially designed for dollies with a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.450 
essentially designed for dollies with a
flat<00:02:00.149> surface<00:02:00.770> maybe<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.130> make<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
flat surface maybe you can make this

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.330 
flat surface maybe you can make this
work<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> tee<00:02:04.110> portion<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> only

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
work with like a tee portion and only

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.249 
work with like a tee portion and only
using<00:02:05.610> three<00:02:05.820> bolts<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.960> I'll

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
using three bolts I don't know I'll

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
using three bolts I don't know I'll
leave<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.700> essentially<00:02:08.940> I'm

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
leave that up to you but essentially I'm

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
leave that up to you but essentially I'm
going<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> flat<00:02:10.560> surface<00:02:10.800> you'll

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
going with a flat surface you'll

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.089 
going with a flat surface you'll
probably<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> Center<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.599> too

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
probably want to Center this too

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.530 
probably want to Center this too
but<00:02:13.730> anyways<00:02:14.439> Center<00:02:15.439> it<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.620> New<00:02:15.739> Year<00:02:15.829> Dali

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
but anyways Center it in New Year Dali

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.959 
but anyways Center it in New Year Dali

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.649 
moving around and you might want to put
something<00:02:51.739> between<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.489> thumb<00:02:53.329> screw<00:02:53.629> and
