when<00:01:17.660> you're<00:01:17.780> making<00:01:17.960> shelters<00:01:18.500> in<00:01:18.620> these

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
when you're making shelters in these

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.620 
when you're making shelters in these
valleys<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.760> to<00:01:19.970> try<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.240> pick<00:01:20.480> these

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
valleys is to try and pick these

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.170 
valleys is to try and pick these
south-facing<00:01:20.960> slopes<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.040> because<00:01:22.970> they<00:01:23.150> see

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
south-facing slopes and because they see

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.870 
south-facing slopes and because they see
more<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> Sun<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.830> means<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.250> trees<00:01:25.640> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
more of the Sun that means the trees and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.340 
more of the Sun that means the trees and
the<00:01:25.970> rocks<00:01:26.350> retain<00:01:27.350> more<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.650> their<00:01:27.860> warmth

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
the rocks retain more of their warmth

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.470 
the rocks retain more of their warmth
okay<00:01:30.350> look<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.710> can<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.820> easy<00:01:32.120> make<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
okay look I can I can easy make a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.150 
okay look I can I can easy make a
shelter<00:01:34.360> here<00:01:35.360> really<00:01:36.080> with<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> with<00:01:37.130> a

branches above again to insulate me from

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.200 
branches above again to insulate me from
above<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.400> will<00:01:52.550> make<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.730> perfectly

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210
