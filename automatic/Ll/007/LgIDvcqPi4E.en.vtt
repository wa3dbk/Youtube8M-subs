00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
2003 Buick Regal watch let's turn the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.439 
2003 Buick Regal watch let's turn the
switch<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.610> again<00:00:16.850> mission<00:00:18.350> back<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.590> again

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
switch off again mission back on again

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.580 
switch off again mission back on again
I'll<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:23.689> look<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.840> all<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I'll do it to the right look at all the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
I'll do it to the right look at all the
gauges<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.220> look<00:00:26.369> look<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.900> all<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
gauges go out look look up all of a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
gauges go out look look up all of a
sudden<00:00:28.289> came<00:00:28.470> back<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> life<00:00:31.790> let's<00:00:32.790> try<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
sudden came back to life let's try that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:42.020 
sudden came back to life let's try that
again<00:00:38.210> my<00:00:39.210> understanding<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:40.579> is<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
again my understanding is is that it's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
again my understanding is is that it's
actually<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.500> call<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.860> ignition

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
actually the what they call the ignition

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
actually the what they call the ignition

you've<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you've got your this here so it's not

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.590 
you've got your this here so it's not
this<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this it's actually this here and all the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
this it's actually this here and all the
wiring<00:00:51.840> harness<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> goes<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
wiring harness that goes down and it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.900 
wiring harness that goes down and it
goes<00:00:54.120> underneath<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.910> watch

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
goes underneath and down there watch

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.009 
goes underneath and down there watch
this<00:00:58.789> pull<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:02.989> put<00:01:03.989> some

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this pull on this a little bit put some

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.550 
this pull on this a little bit put some
pressure<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> sudden<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
pressure on there all of a sudden it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
pressure on there all of a sudden it
stops<00:01:08.119> now<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.330> fine<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> ordered<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> new

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
stops now it's fine so I ordered a new

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
stops now it's fine so I ordered a new
one<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.439> about<00:01:13.439> $100<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:14.310> eBay<00:01:14.810> I'm

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
one of these about $100 off eBay I'm

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.490 
one of these about $100 off eBay I'm
going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> switch<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> over<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> here's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
going to switch that over now so here's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.910 
going to switch that over now so here's
the<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.280> bought<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> number

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the new one that I bought see the number

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.499 
the new one that I bought see the number
there

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.130 

and<00:01:28.869> it's<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.320> whole<00:01:29.500> wiring<00:01:30.009> harness<00:01:30.369> oh

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and it's the whole wiring harness oh

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.420 
and it's the whole wiring harness oh
it's<00:01:32.140> actually<00:01:32.259> not<00:01:32.560> very<00:01:32.950> long<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:35.430> those

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
it's actually not very long but those

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.399 
it's actually not very long but those
from<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.700> other<00:01:36.820> side<00:01:37.060> I've<00:01:37.899> taken<00:01:38.170> off<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
from the other side I've taken off the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.800 
from the other side I've taken off the
covers<00:01:38.860> here<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.469> runs<00:01:41.679> down<00:01:42.420> along<00:01:43.420> there

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
covers here and it runs down along there

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.779 
covers here and it runs down along there
and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.729> end<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:47.500> screwed<00:01:47.950> in<00:01:48.159> down

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
and then this end is screwed in down

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.539 
and then this end is screwed in down
there<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.229> we'll<00:01:50.470> change<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.950> out<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.369> see

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
there so we'll change that out and see

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.559 
there so we'll change that out and see
if<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.759> makes<00:01:51.969> a<00:01:52.090> difference

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
if that makes a difference

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.069 
if that makes a difference
well<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.679> will<00:01:53.829> make<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.069> difference<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.899> when

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
well it will make a difference so when

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.719 
well it will make a difference so when
you're<00:01:56.200> underneath<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> dash<00:01:56.950> you've<00:01:57.520> got

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
you're underneath the dash you've got

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.830 
you're underneath the dash you've got
actually<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:59.140> unscrewed<00:01:59.530> it<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.420> wire<00:02:01.599> it's

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
actually have unscrewed it the wire it's

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.660 
actually have unscrewed it the wire it's
hard<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.619> little<00:02:02.770> bit<00:02:02.950> but<00:02:03.280> this

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
hard to see there a little bit but this

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.240 
hard to see there a little bit but this
is<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.090> there<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.439> that's<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.920> there<00:02:06.099> so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
is on there and that's on there so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.719 
is on there and that's on there so
you've<00:02:06.399> got<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.579> take<00:02:06.700> these<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.630> off<00:02:07.899> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you've got to take these this off that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.400 
you've got to take these this off that
stays<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.620> off<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.370> stays<00:02:13.079> now<00:02:14.079> here's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
stays and this off that stays now here's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.380 
stays and this off that stays now here's
the<00:02:14.620> hiring<00:02:15.190> wiring<00:02:15.760> harness<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.239> you're

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the hiring wiring harness that you're

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.339 
the hiring wiring harness that you're
going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.620> change<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.569> now<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:19.840> gonna<00:02:20.019> pull

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
going to change but now I'm gonna pull

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to change but now I'm gonna pull
up<00:02:20.500> through<00:02:21.040> here<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> around<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:25.170> well

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
up through here and around there well

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.789 
up through here and around there well
here's<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> old<00:02:26.799> wiring<00:02:27.190> harness<00:02:28.620> pull<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
here's the old wiring harness pull it

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.860 
here's the old wiring harness pull it
out<00:02:29.920> ignition<00:02:30.519> switch<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.239> guess<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.630> goal<00:02:31.840> I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
out ignition switch I guess it's goal I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.910 
out ignition switch I guess it's goal I
took<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.410> apart<00:02:32.859> just<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.880> bunch<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:35.079> bunch

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
took this apart just a bunch of a bunch

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.879 
took this apart just a bunch of a bunch
of<00:02:36.400> crap<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.730> there<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.569> anyways<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.709> see

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
of crap in there but anyways you can see

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.979 
of crap in there but anyways you can see
there's<00:02:39.069> lots<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.519> wires<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.959> I

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
there's lots of wires and so I

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.449 
there's lots of wires and so I
guess<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:41.440> uh<00:02:42.239> that's<00:02:43.239> what<00:02:43.510> did<00:02:43.660> it

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
guess that's uh that's what did it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.960 
guess that's uh that's what did it
anyways<00:02:45.459> let's<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:47.430> let's<00:02:48.430> see

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
anyways let's see let's see

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:01.690 
anyways let's see let's see
turn<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> key<00:02:50.049> oh<00:02:53.430> oh

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.420 

we'll<00:03:02.660> try<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.900> flashers<00:03:04.630> works<00:03:06.430> engine

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
we'll try the flashers works engine

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.300
