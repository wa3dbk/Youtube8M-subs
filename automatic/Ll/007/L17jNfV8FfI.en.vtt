right<00:00:55.980> there<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> folds<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.829> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
right there it folds down to this way so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.219 
right there it folds down to this way so
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.399> now<00:01:00.329> X<00:01:00.809> aircraft<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.710> using<00:01:02.520> the

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.330 
thing that I like about it is this
gimbal<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.640> front<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.680> single<00:02:24.010> axis

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
gimbal on the front it's a single axis

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.420 
gimbal on the front it's a single axis
stabilized<00:02:24.940> gimbal<00:02:25.450> alright<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:26.769> not<00:02:27.010> dual

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
stabilized gimbal alright it's not dual

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.780 
stabilized gimbal alright it's not dual
axis<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.420> gonna<00:02:28.599> use<00:02:28.989> only<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.670> it's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
axis so it's gonna use only so it's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.660 
axis so it's gonna use only so it's
gonna<00:02:30.879> give<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.239> only<00:02:31.450> till<00:02:31.959> 2<00:02:32.230> XS<00:02:32.650> which<00:02:33.519> is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
gonna give you only till 2 XS which is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.780 
gonna give you only till 2 XS which is
enough<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.440> stabilize<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.640> when

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
enough and it can stabilize so that when

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729 
enough and it can stabilize so that when
the<00:02:36.879> quad<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.299> tilting<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.049> can<00:02:38.290> stabilize

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
the quad is tilting it can stabilize

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.860 
the quad is tilting it can stabilize
itself<00:02:39.069> but<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.060> dangerous<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.750> fly

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
itself but that is very dangerous to fly

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.759 
itself but that is very dangerous to fly
fpv<00:02:41.349> with<00:02:41.470> GoPro<00:02:41.829> video<00:02:42.099> out<00:02:42.579> or<00:02:43.000> gopro<00:02:43.450> fpv<00:02:43.989> so

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
fpv with GoPro video out or gopro fpv so

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.110 
fpv with GoPro video out or gopro fpv so
what<00:02:44.950> I'm<00:02:45.040> gonna<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.459> disable<00:02:45.819> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
what I'm gonna do is disable the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.729 
what I'm gonna do is disable the
stabilization<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:46.989> gonna<00:02:47.079> use<00:02:47.410> this

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
stabilization and it's gonna use this

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.360 
stabilization and it's gonna use this
tilt<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.670> ground<00:02:49.000> for<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.950> for<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
tilt to ground for just for you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.069 
tilt to ground for just for you
surveillance<00:02:51.940> or<00:02:52.060> looking<00:02:52.390> around<00:02:52.510> purpose

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
surveillance or looking around purpose

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.949 
surveillance or looking around purpose
on<00:02:53.290> manual<00:02:53.829> control<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.480> second<00:02:55.750> thing<00:02:55.900> I

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
on manual control and the second thing I

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.300 
on manual control and the second thing I
like<00:02:56.109> about<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.470> game<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:56.769> it<00:02:56.920> takes<00:02:57.099> all

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
like about this game but it takes all

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.390 
like about this game but it takes all
kind<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.700> cars<00:02:58.060> go<00:02:58.239> for<00:02:58.420> one<00:02:58.569> GoPro<00:02:58.959> 2<00:02:59.140> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
kind of cars go for one GoPro 2 and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.479 
kind of cars go for one GoPro 2 and
GoPro<00:03:00.400> 3<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:01.359> easy<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> fit<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:03.250> course

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
GoPro 3 all easy to fit and of course

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.690 
GoPro 3 all easy to fit and of course
I'm<00:03:03.670> also<00:03:03.849> gonna<00:03:04.120> see<00:03:04.450> if<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:04.900> fit<00:03:05.109> my<00:03:05.700> drift

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
I'm also gonna see if I can fit my drift

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.839 
I'm also gonna see if I can fit my drift
the<00:03:06.790> entity<00:03:07.120> ghost<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:08.340> neat<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.609> clean

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
the entity ghost in there neat and clean

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.479 
the entity ghost in there neat and clean
setup<00:03:10.510> all<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.590> need<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.859> do<00:03:11.950> install<00:03:12.310> your

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
setup all you need to do install your

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.699 
setup all you need to do install your
receiver<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:12.879> it's<00:03:13.180> ready<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.540> fly<00:03:13.780> after

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
receiver and it's ready to fly after

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.349 
receiver and it's ready to fly after
compass<00:03:15.010> calibration<00:03:15.190> pre-flight<00:03:15.970> setup

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
compass calibration pre-flight setup

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.479 
compass calibration pre-flight setup
super<00:03:17.079> X<00:03:17.380> inside<00:03:17.769> that's<00:03:17.950> what<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.130> love<00:03:18.340> about

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
super X inside that's what I love about

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.500 
super X inside that's what I love about
it<00:03:18.819> no<00:03:19.150> more<00:03:19.329> NASA<00:03:19.569> well<00:03:20.319> forgot<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.799> show<00:03:20.980> you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
it no more NASA well forgot to show you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.620 
it no more NASA well forgot to show you
after<00:03:22.510> unfolding<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:24.280> looks<00:03:24.549> like<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.090> of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
after unfolding this looks like this of

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.360 
after unfolding this looks like this of
course<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.049> GPS<00:03:26.380> antenna<00:03:26.530> will<00:03:26.859> be<00:03:26.980> sticking

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
course in GPS antenna will be sticking

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.740 
course in GPS antenna will be sticking
up<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.049> this<00:03:29.049> is<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.410> after<00:03:30.010> unfolding

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
up so this is it after unfolding

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.260 
up so this is it after unfolding
beautiful<00:03:31.750> nice
