00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.379
 hi friends now i want to tell you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.130
 your opinion about the game spec ops the line 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.240
 polar opinions in this product 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 say different people 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 I'll tell you a lot in this game. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 I like a lot of things very much 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.390
 I'll start by not liking this 1 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.680
 visual style visual style is simple 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.539
 disgusting though I can praise 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.809
 developers what about what they 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.640
 added a selection of visual light filter 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 filters that we can use 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 with the passage all the same visual 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 style even the design of some things 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.360
 I donâ€™t like levels very much 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.950
 I often had problems that I 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.750
 just unpleasant 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 with a general tolerable level of graphics 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 unpleasant to look at the screen itself 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.289
 it gets in the way when you play 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 and something obviously distracts you the second thing 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.660
 which I don't like is the shootout 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.189
 and in particular the gameplay itself is dull 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.740
 honestly in fact he very often 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.950
 not interesting to shoot not interesting 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 run some enemies that are not very smart 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.080
 sandbill that spill over 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.119
 to fall asleep enemies 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.549
 Someone who I cheat she 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.950
 I used it three times and all these 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.810
 three times it was required by the plot 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 There is a completely ordinary shooter in 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.360
 unused chip as sand 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 who settle on the heads of our enemies 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 this is actually 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.890
 the two most important minus is dull 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.170
 gameplay and not very unsightly design 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 these are two things that really 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 quite significant and pretty to me 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.970
 not much like it but there are good things 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 which more outweigh 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.399
 cons of this game these things a lot but in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.049
 in general, they can be described as a plot and everything 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.930
 what is connected with it 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.610
 that is, I really like the characters 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
 ok, not all characters don't like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.580
 only the main character but in principle 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 this is almost 95 percent of all those 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.070
 characters 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
 itself shows that we see in the game so 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.540
 what can I say then what if it is you 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.330
 like that you like everyone for knives 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.990
 this game it's pretty self-confident 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.260
 warrior with whom during all the single 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.270
 campaigns are undergoing some changes 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 and not necessarily good i won't 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.360
 spoil but it's very entertaining 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.550
 watch as human consciousness 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.620
 changes under certain conditions and to 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.160
 the same at the end of the single campaign 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.540
 vs 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.220
 multiplayer, I will not say anything 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 because everything is multiplayer and in principle 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.840
 shit at the end of the single player campaign to us 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.440
 you will need to make a choice and very 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.810
 complicated interesting and your mother incomprehensible 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.330
 absolutely incomprehensible i don't understand what the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
 bullshit came up with a choice which 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.740
 we need to perform its results 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.840
 more precisely the perfume of what will happen when you 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.500
 This is not entirely clear. 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.450
 pretty sad but want to notice 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.330
 go through a story campaign to follow 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.670
 the change of consciousness of the protagonist is very 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.220
 interesting that is why someone play 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.530
 worth playing that is if you are afraid 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.860
 not very nice graphics boring 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.300
 gameplay fear further but for the sake of this 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.250
 stories that tell us 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.380
 the developers of this game are definitely 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.390
 worth playing is all i wanted to say 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.490
 about this game if you are even a little bit 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.520
 liked this video subscribe to 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.350
 channel and then I will come and your mother and okay 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.720
 I will not take a joke on it 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.720
 jura khovansky for now thanks for watching
