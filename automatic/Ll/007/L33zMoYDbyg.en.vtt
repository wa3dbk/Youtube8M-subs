just own that shit and Samsung saw how
good<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.920> build<00:01:05.159> quality<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
good the build quality was on this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800 
good the build quality was on this
device<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.470> z2<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> said

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
device with the z2 and on up and said

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
device with the z2 and on up and said
well<00:01:10.020> fuck<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> they

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
well fuck it we got to do that and they

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
well fuck it we got to do that and they
did<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.600> lost<00:01:12.869> money

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
did you know they lost money

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.109 
did you know they lost money
quarter-over-quarter<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
quarter-over-quarter and they just

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
quarter-over-quarter and they just
couldn't<00:01:15.509> lose<00:01:15.750> any<00:01:15.930> more<00:01:16.110> money<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
couldn't lose any more money I think and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
couldn't lose any more money I think and
that's<00:01:17.159> partly<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.759> their<00:01:18.090> shareholders

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that's partly because their shareholders

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
that's partly because their shareholders
and<00:01:18.750> someone's<00:01:19.080> today<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.310> Sony's<00:01:20.880> not

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and someone's today you know Sony's not

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.539 
and someone's today you know Sony's not
really<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> US<00:01:21.869> market<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.890> why

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really in the US market you know why

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
really in the US market you know why
don't<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> glass<00:01:24.600> build

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
don't we take a look at a glass build

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.340 
don't we take a look at a glass build
you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> smart<00:01:28.140> move

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you know so I think it was a smart move

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
you know so I think it was a smart move
by<00:01:28.650> Samsung<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.960> putting<00:01:30.960> these

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
by Samsung to do so putting these

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
by Samsung to do so putting these
devices<00:01:31.530> side-by-side<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.670> Xperia<00:01:33.180> z3<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
devices side-by-side the Xperia z3 is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.929 
devices side-by-side the Xperia z3 is
actually<00:01:34.500> taller<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> show

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually taller now I'm going to show

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.990 
actually taller now I'm going to show
you<00:01:36.119> why<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.350> minute

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
you why that is here in just a minute

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
you why that is here in just a minute
it's<00:01:39.000> also<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.729> experience<00:01:41.729> between

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's also with so the experience between

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's also with so the experience between
these<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.329> devices<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.869> size<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.229> far<00:01:46.439> as

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
these two devices is the size as far as

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249 
these two devices is the size as far as
the<00:01:46.710> thickness<00:01:47.189> they're<00:01:47.850> actually<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the thickness they're actually if i can

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
the thickness they're actually if i can
give<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.409> guys<00:01:49.649> an<00:01:49.829> example<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.759> them

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
give you guys an example if i put them

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
give you guys an example if i put them
right<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.899> each<00:01:51.990> other<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.799> put

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
right next to each other or if i put

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.270 
right next to each other or if i put
something<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.670> them<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.409> it's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
something on them so there it's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.700 
something on them so there it's
negligible<00:01:59.969> i<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> say<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
negligible i want to say that that the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
negligible i want to say that that the
the<00:02:01.740> z3<00:02:02.700> may<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> tad<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.380> thicker<00:02:04.649> than<00:02:04.950> the

the z3 may be a tad bit thicker than the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.760 
the z3 may be a tad bit thicker than the
s6<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.659> negligible<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.649> going

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
s6 but it's negligible you're not going

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
s6 but it's negligible you're not going
to<00:02:07.860> notice<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> difference<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.879> honest

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to notice the difference to be honest

to notice the difference to be honest
with<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.319> minuscule<00:02:11.510> you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
with you it's so minuscule you

camera all way around the Samsung camera
is<00:02:35.470> better<00:02:35.650> because<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.250> OIS<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.630> also

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
is better because of the OIS and it also

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.039
