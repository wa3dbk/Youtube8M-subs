00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 the center of subtropical 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.280
 South Atlantic during these upcoming 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 days even during the carnival is going to 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.820
 approach brazil to approach the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 southeast region but will continue to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.500
 The ocean 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.920
 in January the center of the subtropical high 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 advanced inside the continent 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 on the interior of Brazil, then the force 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 blockade was much higher 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 now I have a high pressure center 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.379
 who is going to approach Brazil but he 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 continues on the ocean will have a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.140
 influence on the weather conditions without 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.879
 doubt, but a less intense blockade 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 of what happened in January 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.620
 only it is still a blockade then the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 wind generated by the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 south atlantic subtropical high 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 rather create a barrier and that barrier 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960
 will stay exactly on Sao Paulo 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.369
 we can see it here for this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 this accumulation 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.170
 see this intensification of color that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.900
 you are seeing here indicates the greatest 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 convergence of events that we have and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.689
 here we are going to stay in this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 lock situation then the cold front 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 what's up people it comes to are 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.119
 paulo and here she will be blocked 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.470
 That's why we have more quantity. 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 of rain over SÃ£o Paulo and also 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 part of the blockade of this front 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.100
 will help to form still areas of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 instability to maintain even areas 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.369
 of instability 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.770
 clouds are quite heavy on top 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.070
 of parana on top of mato grosso do sul 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 and also on top of Santa Catarina then 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 in this carnival the greatest concern with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.750
 rain that can cause a problem is 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 just for a state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.649
 because I'm going to have a cold front that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 will be standing here in thick mato 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.170
 southern parana and also santa catarina
