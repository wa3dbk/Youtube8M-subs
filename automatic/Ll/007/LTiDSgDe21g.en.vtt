00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
really exciting to be tested I've had

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.600 
really exciting to be tested I've had
this<00:00:34.830> for<00:00:35.070> probably<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.430> month<00:00:35.670> now<00:00:36.210> Pat<00:00:36.900> it<00:00:37.080> out

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
this for probably a month now Pat it out

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.939 
this for probably a month now Pat it out
sub-zero<00:00:38.610> temps<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.269> know<00:00:39.390> 25<00:00:39.870> below<00:00:40.140> had<00:00:40.769> it

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
sub-zero temps you know 25 below had it

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.040 
sub-zero temps you know 25 below had it
in<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.370> sleep<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.789> other<00:00:41.940> day<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.719> gotten

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
in some sleep the other day it's gotten

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
in some sleep the other day it's gotten
wet<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.680> gotten<00:00:43.980> cold<00:00:44.190> everything's<00:00:44.969> been

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
wet it's gotten cold everything's been

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.330 
wet it's gotten cold everything's been
really<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.600> couple<00:00:46.110> nice<00:00:46.620> functions<00:00:47.160> about

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
really good couple nice functions about

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
really good couple nice functions about
it<00:00:47.520> obviously<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:48.750> moves<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.649> aim<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it obviously it moves so you can aim it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.150 
it obviously it moves so you can aim it
the<00:00:50.850> strapping<00:00:51.420> system<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> two-piece

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the strapping system here is two-piece

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.330 
the strapping system here is two-piece
like<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> good<00:00:54.079> swimming<00:00:55.079> goggles<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
like a good swimming goggles so it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.430 
like a good swimming goggles so it
really<00:00:56.789> sits<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.539> stays<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.780> place<00:00:58.140> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
really sits in and stays in place this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.619 
really sits in and stays in place this
doesn't<00:00:58.890> move<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.940> nice<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.210> level

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
doesn't move here so it's nice and level

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.549 
doesn't move here so it's nice and level
it's<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:02.120> functional<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> petal<00:01:04.170> using<00:01:04.500> an

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it's also functional by a petal using an

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
it's also functional by a petal using an
operating<00:01:04.920> system<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:05.820> makes<00:01:06.180> sense<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
operating system if that makes sense so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.730 
operating system if that makes sense so
come<00:01:06.660> on<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.289> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> show<00:01:07.679> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
come on over it will kind of show you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490 
come on over it will kind of show you
what<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:08.070> looking<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.570> rxp<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
what we're looking at this is my rxp I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.640 
what we're looking at this is my rxp I
can<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.670> how<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.840> charged<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.440> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
can see how well it's charged and I can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350 
can see how well it's charged and I can
come<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.400> reactive<00:01:15.150> lighting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
come in here and reactive lighting

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
come in here and reactive lighting
versus<00:01:15.930> constant<00:01:16.380> line<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> does<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
versus constant line what it does is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.640 
versus constant line what it does is
when<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.360> gets<00:01:18.600> brighter<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.470> actually

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
when it gets brighter out it actually

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
when it gets brighter out it actually
dims<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> light<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.790> save<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> battery<00:01:21.630> power

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
dims the light to save the battery power

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
dims the light to save the battery power
that's<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> gets<00:01:23.729> darker<00:01:24.180> it'll

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that's going and as it gets darker it'll

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.280 
that's going and as it gets darker it'll
light<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:25.079> up<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.400> low

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
light back up so what I have is low

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.749

medium high reactive lighting that baby

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
medium high reactive lighting that baby
will<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.509> dang<00:01:33.750> bright<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
will get pretty dang bright then if I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.330 
will get pretty dang bright then if I
want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> switch<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
want to switch out from that I go to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.240 
want to switch out from that I go to
constant<00:01:38.340> light<00:01:38.570> what<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
constant light what you have here is you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.069 
constant light what you have here is you
have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.490> disperse<00:01:42.030> bulb<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
have a disperse bulb and you have a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
have a disperse bulb and you have a
direct<00:01:43.470> bulb<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.390> constant<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
direct bulb when it's on constant that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.830 
direct bulb when it's on constant that
doesn't<00:01:46.560> change<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.670> sensor<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> then

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
doesn't change with that sensor and then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.280 
doesn't change with that sensor and then
all<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.619> low<00:01:50.810> medium<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.140> what

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
all I do that's low medium and so what

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050 
all I do that's low medium and so what
you<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.070> medium<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you see is on medium and you get a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
you see is on medium and you get a
little<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.479> direct<00:01:54.869> light<00:01:55.110> they're<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
little more direct light they're a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.880 
little more direct light they're a
little<00:01:56.040> less<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.610> dispersed<00:01:57.180> light<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
little less of that dispersed light and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.670 
little less of that dispersed light and
on<00:01:58.890> high<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.270> goes<00:02:00.479> basically<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> direct

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
on high it goes basically to that direct

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.190 
on high it goes basically to that direct
light<00:02:01.920> essentially<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.299> their<00:02:03.450> other
