00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello girls, I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.970
 nails that they asked me and it's crazy 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.350
 inspired by a blouse in fact I have 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.210
 all my colors that I will leave 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.559
 showing first I have a green 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 metallic a greenish blue a green 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.020
 creamy a pastel yellow 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 right away I have a lime color too 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.060
 creamy 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 and then a green apple and then black 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 creamy are the colors that I'm going to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.040
 use and I'll start preparing the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.220
 area I have the colors aligned but 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.770
 according to the design that I want to make you go 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.949
 I'm going to intersperse the colors then 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.410
 I'm going to notice that the colors are one 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.660
 dark and one clear one dark and one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 clear and not too sticky colors 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.059
 that are not too similar trying 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.650
 that are the contrasting colors and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.299
 now I am arranging to uncover all the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.659
 colors so they are ready to 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:05.479
 be used without having to waste time and 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.479
 I prepare my area which is a good shirt 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 I start of course with clean nails and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.910
 with a layer of a base for the enamel 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.150
 that will make it last longer and I will 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.270
 start by applying the colors in a 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.690
 similar position on each nail but it's going to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.430
 be one color at a time in all the nails 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.400
 to make it easier and not to lose and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 the control of being alternating 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.810
 colors then I follow with one more color 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 clear as not to get out by colors 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 contrasting is not going to be difficult 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.430
 they took one that is not similar 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.430
 the previous 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.970
 in this process for me it is important 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.649
 that there is a kind of droplet so that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 the color is not too translucent 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.030
 but the color really stands out 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.190
 that I am applying and has already left a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.650
 amount enough 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.780
 that is not translucent to not have to 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.510
 give two layers to the colors because 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.310
 It would be too much work and so it continued 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.590
 that process with all the colors that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 use study is going to be the color of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.940
 blouse I tell them where I 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.640
 I inspired sometimes there are going to be some 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.010
 mistakes and I can try to in the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.690
 cuticles so remove the excess but if 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.610
 no matter the end we will see how 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.650
 how I clean the cuticles after 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.650
 finish the look of a 2 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.620
 now I have about half of 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.650
 colors put a little bit more and I'm going to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.450
 look at me from a distance as you are seeing and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.580
 I want that I want it to look all even 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.890
 the colors that look symmetrical are 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.430
 see balanced and that's why I'm going to apply 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.940
 a little black dots so that it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.220
 go go grabbing shape the design that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.380
 do not see anything else black in one part and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.630
 in others not being able to check that it looks 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.570
 more or less as I say symmetrical that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.110
 it looks balanced on the print that 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.110
 we are creating 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.180
 already at this point I'm seeing how 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 I have some transparencies some 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.770
 places and then I'm not going to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.050
 use the glazes in the order in which 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.340
 but what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.709
 try to fill those gaps 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.380
 transparent that they left me with some 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.330
 enamel that is not too similar to 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.940
 color that is on the side I 'm going to look for 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.980
 the tones that I need to put in 'the in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.810
 the areas so that all are well 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.660
 distributed and try not to 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:47.260
 repeat as I tell you to be 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.260
 a stamping thus balanced and even 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.470
 at the end a few little touches of black 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.140
 also where missing 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.760
 to create the look I want and so on 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.260
 It is as it is but they were very dirty 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.760
 the cuticles I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.820
 acetone 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.610
 and use an angular brush with this 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.710
 let's clean the cuticle but without 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.650
 damage the work we just did 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.810
 that's my way of cleaning the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.420
 cuticles I had been asked between 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.420
 on facebook because they liked that the 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.160
 photos come out very clean and in my case I am 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.760
 very perfectionist when I do a what 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.620
 graphed a design of the nails then 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.900
 today cleaning and then I'm removing the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 painting and I put the napkin 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.670
 I put a layer of protector the layer of 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.370
 top coat and so it will not stain 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.400
 the little bottle cleaned the excess in the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.560
 Brush brush on the napkin and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.630
 Well, this is the look the tutorial that 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.590
 that I owed these nails we see 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.590
 the next pope 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.339
 Y
