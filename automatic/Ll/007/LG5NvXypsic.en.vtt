00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910 
I'm a hippie here and that have a claim
but<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.170> gonna<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.470> very<00:02:14.709> nice

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
but it's gonna be very nice

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
but it's gonna be very nice
experimenting<00:02:15.790> making<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:16.360> cheese<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
experimenting making some cheese and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.780 
experimenting making some cheese and
different<00:02:17.410> types<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.709> yogurt<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
different types of yogurt and all that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.210 
different types of yogurt and all that
sort<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.150> thing<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.170> too<00:02:20.410> much<00:02:20.530> milk<00:02:20.740> for<00:02:21.069> us

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
sort of thing it is too much milk for us

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.480 
sort of thing it is too much milk for us
so<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:22.000> we<00:02:22.150> would<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.690> doing<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.500> using<00:02:24.160> all

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
so what we would be doing is using all

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.550 
so what we would be doing is using all
the<00:02:24.580> milk<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.940> need<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> rest<00:02:25.660> gets<00:02:26.170> old

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
the milk we need and the rest gets old

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.710 
the milk we need and the rest gets old
so<00:02:27.250> there's<00:02:27.520> no<00:02:27.610> problem<00:02:28.030> about<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> about

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
so there's no problem about that about

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.910 
so there's no problem about that about
having<00:02:28.900> too<00:02:29.170> much<00:02:30.720> well<00:02:31.720> not<00:02:32.500> really<00:02:32.650> I've

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
having too much well not really I've

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.100 
having too much well not really I've
been<00:02:33.099> going<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.580> place<00:02:33.940> nearby<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.450> buy<00:02:34.810> raw

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
been going to a place nearby to buy raw

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.830 
been going to a place nearby to buy raw
dairy<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.430> been<00:02:36.640> good<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:37.150> I'm<00:02:37.480> just

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
dairy and it's been good but I'm just

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.220 
dairy and it's been good but I'm just
tired<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> trip<00:02:39.250> every<00:02:39.550> week<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.450> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
tired of the trip every week there and I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
tired of the trip every week there and I
have<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> space<00:02:41.830> here<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.430> have<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.819> good

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
have the space here and I have the good

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.449 
have the space here and I have the good
grass<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.840> thought<00:02:44.080> why<00:02:44.740> not<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:45.130> our<00:02:45.310> own

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
grass so I thought why not have our own

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.170 
grass so I thought why not have our own
cow<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.560> yeah<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:48.490> why<00:02:48.610> we<00:02:48.819> got<00:02:48.849> her

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
cow and so yeah that's why we got her

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.940 
cow and so yeah that's why we got her
and<00:02:49.599> we're<00:02:49.810> really<00:02:49.959> excited<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.620> her

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and we're really excited to have her

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.040 
and we're really excited to have her
here<00:02:51.000> she<00:02:52.000> doesn't<00:02:52.360> eat<00:02:52.630> any<00:02:52.900> grains<00:02:53.410> or<00:02:53.890> any

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
here she doesn't eat any grains or any

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.080 
here she doesn't eat any grains or any
pre-made<00:02:56.080> feeds<00:02:56.680> nothing<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.550> she

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
pre-made feeds nothing like that she

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.750 
pre-made feeds nothing like that she
only<00:02:58.239> eats<00:02:58.390> grass<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.800> grass<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.459> is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
only eats grass and the grass here is

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.550 
only eats grass and the grass here is
completely<00:03:01.480> organic<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.170> doesn't<00:03:02.440> get

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
completely organic it doesn't get

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.809 
completely organic it doesn't get
treated<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.099> any<00:03:03.430> way

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
treated in any way

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.149 
treated in any way
the<00:03:04.329> grass<00:03:04.599> here<00:03:04.959> just<00:03:05.230> grows<00:03:05.469> super<00:03:05.890> super

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
the grass here just grows super super

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.849 
the grass here just grows super super
fast<00:03:06.400> because<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.000> soil<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.260> soaked<00:03:08.650> for

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
fast because the soil is so soaked for

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.880 
fast because the soil is so soaked for
that<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.689> demand<00:03:10.689> you<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.170> see<00:03:11.379> she<00:03:11.560> has<00:03:11.590> eaten

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
that I demand you can see she has eaten

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.420 
that I demand you can see she has eaten
all<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.280> grass<00:03:12.840> behind<00:03:13.840> me<00:03:14.049> but<00:03:14.709> over<00:03:15.159> here

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
all this grass behind me but over here

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.580 
all this grass behind me but over here
there's<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.819> little<00:03:16.090> electric<00:03:16.239> fence<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.109> that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
there's a little electric fence and that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.099 
there's a little electric fence and that
electric<00:03:18.010> fence<00:03:18.189> gets<00:03:18.579> moved<00:03:18.849> every<00:03:19.599> day<00:03:19.810> so

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
electric fence gets moved every day so

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.500 
electric fence gets moved every day so
she<00:03:20.260> has<00:03:20.530> fresh<00:03:20.890> grass<00:03:21.220> every<00:03:21.640> day<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.269> once

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
she has fresh grass every day and once

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.000 
she has fresh grass every day and once
she's<00:03:22.720> done<00:03:22.900> here<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.439> she's<00:03:23.620> going<00:03:23.829> to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
she's done here that she's going to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.300 
she's done here that she's going to
another<00:03:24.640> place<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.379> in<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.099> garden

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
another place here in in in the garden

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.000 
another place here in in in the garden
and<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.659> she<00:03:28.780> always<00:03:28.900> has<00:03:29.230> fresh<00:03:29.560> grass

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and so that she always has fresh grass

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.429 
and so that she always has fresh grass
we<00:03:30.400> won't<00:03:30.579> be<00:03:30.700> giving<00:03:31.030> her<00:03:31.239> any<00:03:31.510> antibiotics

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
we won't be giving her any antibiotics

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.339 
we won't be giving her any antibiotics
or<00:03:32.739> hormones<00:03:32.950> or<00:03:33.849> anything<00:03:34.420> any<00:03:35.019> synthetic

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
or hormones or anything any synthetic

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.619 
or hormones or anything any synthetic
things<00:03:35.920> like<00:03:36.159> that<00:03:36.340> everything<00:03:37.120> she<00:03:37.269> will<00:03:37.480> be

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
things like that everything she will be

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.170 
things like that everything she will be
eating<00:03:37.959> will<00:03:38.200> be<00:03:38.409> just<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.310> fresh<00:03:39.760> organic

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
eating will be just the fresh organic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.690 
eating will be just the fresh organic
grass<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.590> drinking<00:03:42.340> lots<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.639> water

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
grass here and drinking lots of water

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.289 
grass here and drinking lots of water
and<00:03:43.120> that's<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.489> am<00:03:45.489> completely<00:03:45.939> against

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
and that's it I am completely against

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.360 
and that's it I am completely against
giving<00:03:46.840> things<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.230> animal<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.159> produce

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
giving things to animal so they produce

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.699 
giving things to animal so they produce
more<00:03:48.760> milk<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.780> sort<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:50.139> thing<00:03:50.230> I'm<00:03:50.560> not

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
more milk or that sort of thing I'm not

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.740 
more milk or that sort of thing I'm not
I<00:03:51.069> don't<00:03:51.819> really<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.299> at<00:03:52.540> all

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
I don't really like that at all

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.899 
I don't really like that at all
so<00:03:53.079> she's<00:03:53.349> going<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.560> be<00:03:53.739> giving<00:03:54.489> really<00:03:54.760> good

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
so she's going to be giving really good

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.420 
so she's going to be giving really good
quality<00:03:55.150> milk<00:03:55.689> and<00:03:55.840> probably<00:03:56.200> laughter<00:03:56.680> asked

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
quality milk and probably laughter asked

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.339 
quality milk and probably laughter asked
if<00:03:57.579> she<00:03:57.970> would<00:03:58.090> be<00:03:58.269> given<00:03:58.569> if<00:03:58.689> she<00:03:58.840> was<00:03:58.989> given

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
if she would be given if she was given

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.349 
if she would be given if she was given
hormones<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.459> things<00:04:00.669> like<00:04:00.879> that<00:04:00.939> but<00:04:01.299> I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
hormones and things like that but I

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.839 
hormones and things like that but I
think<00:04:01.450> quality<00:04:02.439> is<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.919> lot<00:04:03.069> more<00:04:03.280> important

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
think quality is a lot more important

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.690
