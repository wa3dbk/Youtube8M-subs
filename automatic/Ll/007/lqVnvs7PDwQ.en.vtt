a college decision within the next week
but<00:00:23.490> there's<00:00:23.699> also<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> chance<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.269> he'll

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
but there's also a chance that he'll

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.820 
but there's also a chance that he'll
wait<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.410> that's<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> strong

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
wait and I think that's a strong

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.259 
wait and I think that's a strong
possibility<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.519> well<00:00:26.550> he's<00:00:26.820> obviously<00:00:26.939> down

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
possibility as well he's obviously down

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
possibility as well he's obviously down

he's just trying to get to the point

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.350 
he's just trying to get to the point
where<00:00:38.190> he<00:00:38.280> he's<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> college

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
where he he's going to make a college

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.610 
where he he's going to make a college
choice<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.050> he's<00:00:40.200> always<00:00:40.379> had

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
choice and you know he's always had

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
choice and you know he's always had
problems<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.579> decisions<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> past

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
problems with decisions in the past

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
problems with decisions in the past
really<00:00:43.170> struggled<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
really struggled with the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.350 
really struggled with the
reclassification<00:00:43.950> decision<00:00:44.820> his<00:00:44.940> dad<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
reclassification decision his dad can I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.880 
reclassification decision his dad can I
had<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> nudge<00:00:45.809> him<00:00:45.930> along<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
had to nudge him along and make that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.840 
had to nudge him along and make that
decision<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.430> we're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
decision so I think we're going to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.160 
decision so I think we're going to
probably<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.629> exact<00:00:48.960> thing<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably see the same exact thing I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.240 
probably see the same exact thing I
think<00:00:49.230> his<00:00:49.440> parents<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> kind

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
anybody that say hey maybe it's a good

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
anybody that say hey maybe it's a good
sign<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.730> us<00:00:59.969> no<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> good

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

time for anyone i think it just delays
the<00:01:02.910> process<00:01:03.210> i<00:01:03.539> truly<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.409> does

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the process i truly think that he does

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
the process i truly think that he does
not<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.100> he<00:01:05.189> wants<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> school

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
are going to kind of wait out the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.069 
are going to kind of wait out the
process<00:02:44.519> none<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.180> them<00:02:45.389> are<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:45.720> cut<00:02:46.049> down

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
process none of them are really cut down

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.589

their<00:02:46.409> list<00:02:46.620> below<00:02:47.220> five<00:02:47.609> I<00:02:47.909> think<00:02:48.150> Ty's<00:02:48.329> Jones

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
their list below five I think Ty's Jones

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.629 
their list below five I think Ty's Jones
might<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.900> seven<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.549> we're

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
might have seven but I don't think we're

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.530 
might have seven but I don't think we're
