a certain time period search and rescue
is<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.960> similar<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> search<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> destroy

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980

if your team picks them up then he will
die<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.239> thought<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:39.989> sort<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> ensured

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
die I thought this was sort of ensured

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
die I thought this was sort of ensured
that<00:00:40.860> campers<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:41.760> easy<00:00:41.850> time

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that campers will not have an easy time

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.060 
that campers will not have an easy time
which<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.450> pretty<00:00:42.629> sweet<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.140> opinion<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
which is pretty sweet in my opinion so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.380 
which is pretty sweet in my opinion so

we have a look at the dual render scope
now<00:00:54.239> previously<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.989> might<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.289> seen<00:00:55.440> black
