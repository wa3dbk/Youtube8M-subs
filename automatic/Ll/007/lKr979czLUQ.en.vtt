00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
click forward and we can click forward

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
click forward and we can click forward
again<00:02:40.099> there<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.129> go<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.519> then<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:41.849> over<00:02:41.940> here

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
again there you go and then go over here

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.589 
again there you go and then go over here
to<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.690> desk<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.459> they<00:02:45.209> will<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.569> a

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
to the desk and they will have a

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.360 
to the desk and they will have a
four-digit<00:02:46.260> combination<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:47.040> four

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
four-digit combination with four

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.130 
four-digit combination with four
different<00:02:47.760> colors<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.329> let's<00:02:48.540> find<00:02:48.840> these

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
different colors so let's find these

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.589 
different colors so let's find these
numbers<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> we'll<00:02:51.900> go<00:02:52.019> back<00:02:52.230> we'll<00:02:53.360> go<00:02:54.360> back

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
numbers so we'll go back we'll go back

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.710 
numbers so we'll go back we'll go back
again<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.579> these<00:02:56.579> numbers<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.180> over

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
again and these numbers are all over

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.360 
again and these numbers are all over
there<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.349> over<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.799> place

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
there all over the place

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.339 
there all over the place
so<00:02:59.579> let's<00:02:59.849> find<00:03:00.030> them<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.319> right

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
so let's find them and then we go right

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.490 
so let's find them and then we go right
one<00:03:01.799> step<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.459> over<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.349> it's

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
one step and go over and I know it's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.339 
one step and go over and I know it's
called<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.860> English<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.810> SAP

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
go back and then go right and they go

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.250 
go back and then go right and they go
right<00:03:19.350> together<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.819> then<00:03:21.540> right<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:22.109> more

green<00:04:14.130> six<00:04:14.519> step<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.419> let's<00:04:15.630> go<00:04:15.750> back<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.260> then

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
green six step so let's go back and then

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.800 
green six step so let's go back and then
we<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.250> keep<00:04:17.579> putting<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.450> combination

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.290 

there<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:22.440> go<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.070> first<00:04:23.250> one<00:04:23.550> was<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.450> free

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
there we go and the first one was a free

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.890 
there we go and the first one was a free
and<00:04:27.770> then<00:04:28.770> we<00:04:29.190> had<00:04:29.400> an<00:04:29.639> 8<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.600> blue<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.600> find

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
and then we had an 8 in blue and I find

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.190 
and then we had an 8 in blue and I find
this<00:04:34.050> very<00:04:34.550> hard<00:04:35.550> tips<00:04:35.970> upon<00:04:36.450> I've<00:04:36.630> found<00:04:36.960> that

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
this very hard tips upon I've found that

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.140 
this very hard tips upon I've found that
it<00:04:37.919> shouldn't<00:04:38.760> be<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.360> hard<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:41.460> select<00:04:41.790> I

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
it shouldn't be that so hard to select I

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.210 
it shouldn't be that so hard to select I
know<00:04:42.330> if<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.840> programs<00:04:43.260> did<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.650> right<00:04:43.950> job

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
know if the programs did a right job

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.330 
know if the programs did a right job
with<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.720> hit<00:04:45.720> detection<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.350> these<00:04:46.500> buttons

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
with a hit detection on these buttons

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.500 
with a hit detection on these buttons
but<00:04:49.010> seems<00:04:50.010> having<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.460> bit<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.880> problem<00:04:51.330> to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
but seems having a bit of problem to

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.300 
but seems having a bit of problem to
select<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.080> but<00:04:52.590> there<00:04:52.830> we<00:04:52.919> go

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
select it but there we go

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.650 
select it but there we go
a<00:04:53.340> green<00:04:53.760> was<00:04:54.000> 6<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.020> red<00:04:55.200> was<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.560> free<00:04:56.660> so

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
a green was 6 and the red was a free so

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.480 
a green was 6 and the red was a free so
there<00:04:57.900> we<00:04:57.960> go<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.320> then<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:59.040> clipper

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.090 
pick it up and then we go back and now
we<00:05:05.640> actually<00:05:05.880> have<00:05:06.590> solved<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.680> whole<00:05:07.710> game

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
we actually have solved the whole game

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.890 
we actually have solved the whole game
because<00:05:08.580> there<00:05:08.850> are<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.210> much<00:05:09.419> other<00:05:09.780> things

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
because there are so much other things

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.960 
because there are so much other things
in<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.470> game<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:11.010> doesn't<00:05:11.520> really<00:05:11.760> matter

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
in this game that doesn't really matter

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.120 
in this game that doesn't really matter
and<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.480> don't<00:05:12.900> know<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.440> let's<00:05:13.470> go<00:05:13.770> back<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:14.040> the
