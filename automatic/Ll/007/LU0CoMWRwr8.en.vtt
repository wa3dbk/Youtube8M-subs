00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.610
 then guys, let's do the first one now 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 one-on-one exercise with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.060
 dribbling in different angles with these 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 structures to you triple net a corner of 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 about 135 about 90 degrees than in some 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.109
 shooting situations even with a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.319
 180 degree angle 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.949
 then you are positioned along the 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:40.199
 perimeter in this rectangle the boys 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:46.530
 who are in that position there 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:48.269
 where jackson will have to defend i 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 boys who played on worse are 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.170
 those who will have to give the ball to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.959
 guys on the web flying 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.619
 they will have to receive and carry out one 

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:59.459
 against one 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:02.489
 turns counterclockwise and defended 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:07.100
 but to hunt has worn it goes to attack 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.219
 and attacked to defend this clear 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.609
 then on my way to my whistle you 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.679
 you will leave rai the ball when going up 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.630
 receive a ball 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:22.049
 ends then will meet in the evening 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.359
 to force on the second whistle will start 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.359
 hard against an active ready 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:39.120
 good receptive in the via pivot which 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:47.550
 still in the proof test 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:53.640
 let's go very well to the second 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:59.180
 maximum whistle never good from the chimneys 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 meaning fast way comes ok 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.170
 creative technical gesture dogs low away 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.290
 good because we can also use the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.470
 stops and restarts is therefore 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.470
 possible projects 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:34.400
 you have time in the bay almost ok 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 which one see ok field good 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.300
 socket 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.980
 callipo to the first dry by the by the gods 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.569
 fast fast be good then when 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.230
 with a speed jim, he is already thinking of the gesture 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.379
 what you have to do 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.489
 madrid thinks what you need to do ok 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.489
 simple change of direction 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.980
 let's see let's take a double step 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.980
 candid sense beautiful and good arrival
