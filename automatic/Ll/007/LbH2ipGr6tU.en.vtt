look<00:04:01.190> at<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.519> if<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.360> wouldn't<00:04:02.570> have<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.720> shader

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
look at this if I wouldn't have a shader

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.650 
look at this if I wouldn't have a shader
moron<00:04:03.350> right<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.820> glass<00:04:05.060> would<00:04:05.300> be<00:04:05.420> almost

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
moron right this glass would be almost

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.090 
moron right this glass would be almost
see-through<00:04:06.050> so<00:04:06.470> we<00:04:06.560> could<00:04:06.709> see<00:04:06.890> everything

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
see-through so we could see everything

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.890 
see-through so we could see everything
but<00:04:07.670> now<00:04:07.820> I<00:04:07.850> got<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> shaders<00:04:08.450> mod<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.810> it's

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
but now I got a shaders mod so it's

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.030 
but now I got a shaders mod so it's
really<00:04:09.019> really<00:04:09.320> really<00:04:09.620> hard<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:10.040> see

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
really really really hard to see

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.670 
really really really hard to see
is<00:04:11.819> there<00:04:12.090> even<00:04:12.120> stuff<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.230> or<00:04:13.470> no<00:04:13.560> this

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
head down again let's take a spin around

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.710 
head down again let's take a spin around
this<00:04:20.040> ship<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:21.090> gonna<00:04:21.269> be<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.449> really<00:04:21.630> short

beautiful structure I've seen that
before<00:04:31.830> we<00:04:32.190> had<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.490> only<00:04:32.669> inspiration

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
before we had that only inspiration

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
hard to see but we've got two propellers

hard to see but we've got two propellers
down<00:04:46.560> here<00:04:47.090> you're<00:04:48.090> powering<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.600> ship<00:04:48.810> we've

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
down here you're powering the ship we've

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.870 
down here you're powering the ship we've
got<00:04:49.050> some<00:04:49.229> row<00:04:49.800> either<00:04:50.039> I<00:04:50.340> don't<00:04:50.400> know<00:04:50.729> what

they're little things which can ask

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.990 
they're little things which can ask
theory<00:04:53.699> ships<00:04:54.000> as<00:04:54.120> well<00:04:55.100> but<00:04:56.100> snap<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.940> know

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
theory ships as well but snap you know

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.250 
theory ships as well but snap you know
what<00:04:57.150> I'm<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.449> curious<00:04:57.720> all<00:04:58.050> right<00:04:58.169> I'm

what I'm kind of curious all right I'm

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.379 
what I'm kind of curious all right I'm
not<00:04:58.350> gonna<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.680> I'm<00:04:59.340> gonna<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.580> semi<00:05:00.030> griefing

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
not gonna be I'm gonna be semi griefing

not gonna be I'm gonna be semi griefing
here<00:05:00.600> is<00:05:00.750> there<00:05:01.050> anything<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.500> inside

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
here is there anything on the inside

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.870 
here is there anything on the inside
nope<00:05:03.110> empty<00:05:04.110> space<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:05.250> there<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.610> that

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
nope empty space is there that is that

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.219 
nope empty space is there that is that
is<00:05:09.000> awesome<00:05:09.389> I'm<00:05:09.510> not<00:05:09.539> really<00:05:09.750> sure<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:09.930> is

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
is awesome I'm not really sure that is

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.439 
is awesome I'm not really sure that is
intended<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.710> be<00:05:10.949> here<00:05:11.130> but<00:05:11.789> we<00:05:12.000> got<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> little

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
intended to be here but we got a little

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.740 
intended to be here but we got a little
oil<00:05:12.750> here<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:14.400> some<00:05:14.669> type<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:15.180> guess<00:05:15.479> it's

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
oil here of of some type I guess it's

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.029 
oil here of of some type I guess it's
kind<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:15.990> water<00:05:16.199> but<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.530> know<00:05:16.620> what<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:16.770> mean

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
kind of water but you know what I mean

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.950 
kind of water but you know what I mean
right<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:17.910> maybe<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.210> ship<00:05:18.510> has<00:05:18.660> been<00:05:18.810> here

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
right so maybe this ship has been here

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.420 
right so maybe this ship has been here
forever<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.560> it's<00:05:19.650> been<00:05:19.800> like<00:05:19.919> pumping<00:05:20.310> out

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
forever and it's been like pumping out

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.689 
forever and it's been like pumping out
oil<00:05:20.610> or<00:05:20.910> something<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.419> don't<00:05:22.320> know<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.889> if<00:05:23.550> you

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
oil or something I don't know and if you

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:24.020 
oil or something I don't know and if you
ever<00:05:23.789> need

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
ever need

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.330 
ever need
unlike<00:05:24.539> in<00:05:24.690> special<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:24.960> container<00:05:25.740> ship<00:05:25.889> I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
unlike in special a container ship I

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.450 
unlike in special a container ship I
think<00:05:27.300> we're<00:05:27.900> gonna<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.139> back<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.440> this<00:05:28.530> look

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
think we're gonna get back to this look

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.750 
think we're gonna get back to this look
at<00:05:29.580> that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
at that

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.400 
at that
it's<00:05:29.940> beautiful<00:05:30.539> but<00:05:31.020> we're<00:05:31.139> gonna<00:05:31.289> look

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
it's beautiful but we're gonna look

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.810 
it's beautiful but we're gonna look
container<00:05:31.860> ship<00:05:32.190> over<00:05:32.460> here<00:05:34.130> which<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:35.280> also

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820
