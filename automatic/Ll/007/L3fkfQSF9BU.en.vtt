00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
into the tip of the ski here so it's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.160 
into the tip of the ski here so it's a
really<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.590> quiet<00:00:58.949> ride<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.170> 7,200

foot I take it yes
so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.789> skied<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> 170<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:05.070> no

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so I skied it in a 170 and there's no

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780 
so I skied it in a 170 and there's no
way<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.810> 170<00:01:07.040> should<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.189> able<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.640> as
