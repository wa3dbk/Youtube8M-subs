everything<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> Z<00:00:44.550> prime<00:00:44.879> half<00:00:45.149> half<00:00:45.780> as

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
everything you do a Z prime half half as

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.100 
everything you do a Z prime half half as
I'd<00:00:46.140> prime<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> turning<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> side<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I'd prime just turning on side like this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'd prime just turning on side like this
then<00:00:49.500> double<00:00:49.770> trigger<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.430> turn

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
then double trigger with your right turn

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:05.230 
then double trigger with your right turn
your<00:00:50.879> left<00:00:51.000> hand<00:00:57.440> ok<00:00:58.440> once<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:58.829> slowly

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:15.200 

alright<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> alga<00:01:13.680> used<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.250> many

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
alright and that's the alga used on many

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
alright and that's the alga used on many
cube<00:01:15.570> bigger<00:01:15.780> than<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> three<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.350> three<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
cube bigger than a three by three I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
cube bigger than a three by three I
think<00:01:17.340> some<00:01:17.549> people<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.119> able<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.659> em

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
think some people are able to do em

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
think some people are able to do em
terms<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.380> four<00:01:19.619> by<00:01:19.740> four<00:01:19.979> maybe<00:01:20.369> even<00:01:20.490> five

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
terms with four by four maybe even five

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
terms with four by four maybe even five
by<00:01:21.000> five<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.799> struggled<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> do

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
by five but I really struggled to do

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
by five but I really struggled to do
that<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.970> four<00:01:24.750> by<00:01:24.869> four<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.170> upwards<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that so four by four and upwards I just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
that so four by four and upwards I just
use<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:28.939> okay<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> battle<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
use this out okay that was a battle and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
use this out okay that was a battle and
again<00:01:39.680> okay<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.640> five<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.270> five<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.549> just

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
again okay and five by five and just

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.560 
again okay and five by five and just
give<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.030> seven<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.450> seven<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.570> on

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
give it a go on seven by seven and on

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960 
give it a go on seven by seven and on
seven<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:54.930> seven
