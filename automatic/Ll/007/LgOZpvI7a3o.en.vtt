which<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> not<00:02:17.230> only<00:02:17.470> symbolic<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.280> also

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
which is not only symbolic but also

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.980 
which is not only symbolic but also
gives<00:02:18.700> me<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> much<00:02:19.060> better<00:02:19.120> appreciation<00:02:19.780> for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
gives me a much better appreciation for

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
gives me a much better appreciation for
the<00:02:20.230> character<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> shukaku<00:02:21.010> we're<00:02:22.000> basically

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the character of shukaku we're basically

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.450 
the character of shukaku we're basically
shukaku<00:02:23.050> lets<00:02:23.410> his<00:02:23.500> guard<00:02:23.560> down<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
shukaku lets his guard down for just a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.220 
shukaku lets his guard down for just a
moment<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.970> he<00:02:25.240> tells<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.630> old<00:02:25.750> man<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.170> he

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
moment and he tells the old man that he

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.600 
moment and he tells the old man that he
actually<00:02:26.380> reminds<00:02:26.920> him<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.160> sage<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
actually reminds him of the sage of the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.760 
actually reminds him of the sage of the
six<00:02:27.700> paths<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.960> actually<00:02:29.350> causes<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
six paths and this actually causes the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.250 
six paths and this actually causes the
old<00:02:29.980> man<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> break<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.820> tears<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.540> he

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
old man to break out in tears and he

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.540 
old man to break out in tears and he
even<00:02:32.320> tells<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.680> coffee<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> was<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
even tells you coffee that that was the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.700 
even tells you coffee that that was the
nicest<00:02:33.760> thing<00:02:33.970> he's<00:02:34.180> ever<00:02:34.270> said<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.630> him<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.170> I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
nicest thing he's ever said to him and I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.350 
nicest thing he's ever said to him and I
think<00:02:35.830> one<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> coolest<00:02:36.520> revelations<00:02:37.180> is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
think one of the coolest revelations is

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.730 
think one of the coolest revelations is
the<00:02:37.480> fact<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.960> symbol<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:38.560> always

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
the fact that that symbol that's always

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.590 
the fact that that symbol that's always
been<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.250> guard<00:02:39.460> his<00:02:39.640> head<00:02:39.850> which<00:02:40.090> means<00:02:40.330> love

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
been on guard his head which means love

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.990 
been on guard his head which means love
actually<00:02:41.290> came<00:02:41.650> from<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:42.010> monk<00:02:42.280> himself<00:02:42.790> who

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
actually came from this monk himself who

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.120 
actually came from this monk himself who
actually<00:02:43.150> has<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.600> symbols<00:02:43.960> on<00:02:44.080> his<00:02:44.230> ends<00:02:44.650> one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
actually has the symbols on his ends one

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.350 
actually has the symbols on his ends one
on<00:02:45.250> each<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.640> when<00:02:45.760> he<00:02:45.820> brings<00:02:46.000> him<00:02:46.210> together

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
on each and when he brings him together

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.420 
on each and when he brings him together
it<00:02:46.690> actually<00:02:46.960> forms<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.350> final<00:02:47.800> symbol<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
it actually forms the final symbol and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.750 
it actually forms the final symbol and
what's<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:49.630> cool<00:02:49.900> about<00:02:49.960> this<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.770> maybe

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
what's really cool about this is maybe

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.600 
what's really cool about this is maybe
he<00:02:52.209> was<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.959> monk<00:02:53.230> who<00:02:53.860> transferred

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
he was actually the monk who transferred

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.610 
he was actually the monk who transferred
that<00:02:55.000> actually<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.810> Gaara<00:02:56.230> when<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
that actually to Gaara when that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.500 
that actually to Gaara when that
happened<00:02:57.040> thus<00:02:57.280> why<00:02:57.430> he<00:02:57.610> has<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.910> symbol<00:02:58.180> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
happened thus why he has that symbol and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.790 
happened thus why he has that symbol and
he<00:02:58.810> probably<00:02:59.050> has<00:02:59.320> an<00:02:59.440> even<00:02:59.650> deeper

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
he probably has an even deeper

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.590 
he probably has an even deeper
connection<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.430> gaara's<00:03:00.850> family<00:03:01.240> which<00:03:01.420> I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
connection to gaara's family which I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.820 
connection to gaara's family which I
just<00:03:01.810> really<00:03:02.020> liked<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.290> scene<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.590> thought

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
just really liked that scene I thought

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.720 
just really liked that scene I thought
it<00:03:02.890> was<00:03:02.980> handled<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.430> well

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
it was handled really well

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.730 
it was handled really well
it<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.270> very<00:03:04.510> atmospheric<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.380> love<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
it was very atmospheric I love the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.260 
it was very atmospheric I love the
coloring<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> music<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:06.970> entire

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
coloring and the music of that entire

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.370 
coloring and the music of that entire
scene<00:03:07.570> definitely<00:03:08.020> one<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> coolest

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
scene definitely one of the coolest

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.400 
scene definitely one of the coolest
things<00:03:08.800> this<00:03:09.010> week<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.550> that's<00:03:10.540> pretty<00:03:11.050> much

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
things this week and that's pretty much

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.530 
things this week and that's pretty much
most<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.220> episode<00:03:12.730> right<00:03:13.030> there<00:03:13.330> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
most of the episode right there it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.630 
most of the episode right there it
pretty<00:03:13.720> much<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.050> ends<00:03:14.440> with<00:03:15.010> moderate

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
pretty much this ends with moderate

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.610 
pretty much this ends with moderate
taking<00:03:16.090> over<00:03:16.330> control<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.020> battlefield

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
taking over control of the battlefield

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.370 
taking over control of the battlefield
as<00:03:17.770> we<00:03:17.920> get<00:03:18.070> prepared<00:03:18.220> for<00:03:18.580> next<00:03:18.730> week's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
as we get prepared for next week's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
as we get prepared for next week's
earth-shattering<00:03:20.380> episode<00:03:20.920> which<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.250> when

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
earth-shattering episode which is when

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.650 
earth-shattering episode which is when
you're<00:03:21.519> definitely<00:03:21.670> going<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.150> tune<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.450> for

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
you're definitely going to tune in for

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.080 
you're definitely going to tune in for
because<00:03:23.380> it's<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.860> last<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.400> before<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:24.790> get

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
because it's the last one before we get

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.330 
because it's the last one before we get
into<00:03:25.300> this<00:03:25.420> filler<00:03:25.720> arc<00:03:26.080> which<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.739> about<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
into this filler arc which is about the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.070 
into this filler arc which is about the
tuning<00:03:27.700> exams<00:03:28.060> which<00:03:28.300> personally<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.810> am

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
tuning exams which personally I am

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.509 
tuning exams which personally I am
excited<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.830> can't<00:03:30.070> wait<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.250> see<00:03:30.400> what

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
excited for I can't wait to see what

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.250 
excited for I can't wait to see what
they're<00:03:30.640> going<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:31.959> one

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
they're going to do with it but one

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.479 
they're going to do with it but one
thing<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.650> interesting<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.160> note<00:03:33.370> about

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
thing that is interesting to note about

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.280 
thing that is interesting to note about
this<00:03:33.700> tuning<00:03:34.090> exam<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:34.959> don't<00:03:35.080> know<00:03:35.140> how

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
this tuning exam is we don't know how

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.550 
this tuning exam is we don't know how
long<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:35.620> gonna<00:03:35.680> go<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.670> if<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:38.110> did

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
long it's gonna go on for and if we did

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.500 
long it's gonna go on for and if we did
the<00:03:38.709> math<00:03:38.920> correctly<00:03:39.190> we<00:03:39.790> looked<00:03:40.000> at<00:03:40.150> how<00:03:40.450> many

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the math correctly we looked at how many

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.210 
the math correctly we looked at how many
chapters<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.140> have<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.560> they<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.800> animate

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
chapters we have that they can animate

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.270 
chapters we have that they can animate
that's<00:03:42.400> roughly<00:03:42.880> about<00:03:42.970> 40<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:44.160> roughly<00:03:45.160> with

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that's roughly about 40 and roughly with

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.100 
that's roughly about 40 and roughly with
the<00:03:45.370> math<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.670> could<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:45.910> about<00:03:46.000> maybe<00:03:46.360> 15

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the math that could do about maybe 15

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.759 
the math that could do about maybe 15
maybe<00:03:47.709> 20<00:03:48.060> episodes<00:03:49.060> left<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.630> series<00:03:49.870> so

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
maybe 20 episodes left of the series so

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.770 
maybe 20 episodes left of the series so
we're<00:03:51.459> getting<00:03:51.640> there<00:03:51.880> quick<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.630> many

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
we're getting there quick so in many

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.960 
we're getting there quick so in many
ways<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.650> tuning<00:03:54.040> exam<00:03:54.340> might<00:03:54.550> be<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.880> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
ways this tuning exam might be just a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.370 
ways this tuning exam might be just a
really<00:03:55.090> great<00:03:55.269> way<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.510> extend<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.170> series

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
really great way to extend the series

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.070 
really great way to extend the series
and<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:58.000> hope<00:03:58.150> they<00:03:58.540> do<00:03:58.720> something<00:03:58.959> good

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
and I just hope they do something good

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.900 
and I just hope they do something good
with<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.410> an<00:03:59.590> inventive<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.400> they<00:04:00.610> just<00:04:00.790> don't

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
with it an inventive and they just don't

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.300 
with it an inventive and they just don't
like<00:04:01.090> repeat<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> lot<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> old<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.500> even

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
like repeat a lot of old and even

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.680 
like repeat a lot of old and even
build<00:04:03.640> upon<00:04:03.940> some<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.300> characters

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
build upon some of the characters

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.150 
build upon some of the characters
especially<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.260> side<00:04:05.500> ones<00:04:05.739> which<00:04:05.920> are<00:04:06.040> going

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
especially the side ones which are going

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.920 
especially the side ones which are going
to<00:04:06.250> be<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.459> star<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:06.940> arc<00:04:07.209> which<00:04:07.720> will

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
to be the star of this arc which will

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.240 
to be the star of this arc which will
allow<00:04:08.110> us<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.290> like<00:04:08.500> these<00:04:08.650> characters<00:04:08.830> even

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
allow us to like these characters even

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.240 
allow us to like these characters even
more<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.180> am<00:04:10.630> excited<00:04:11.200> for<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:11.890> what's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
more so I am excited for that but what's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.400 
more so I am excited for that but what's
the<00:04:12.430> rundown<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.660> week's<00:04:13.930> episode<00:04:14.110> of

the rundown on this week's episode of

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.199 
the rundown on this week's episode of
Naruto<00:04:14.860> Shippuden<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.549> was<00:04:15.760> pretty<00:04:16.030> good

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
Naruto Shippuden it was pretty good

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.610 
Naruto Shippuden it was pretty good
definitely<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.720> best<00:04:16.900> one<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.410> last

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
definitely the best one in the last

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.650 
definitely the best one in the last
couple<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:17.979> weeks<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.820> artwork<00:04:19.479> in<00:04:19.600> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
couple of weeks the artwork in the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.810 
couple of weeks the artwork in the
animation<00:04:20.080> was<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.229> little<00:04:20.709> better<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.519> action

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
animation was a little better the action

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.120 
animation was a little better the action
scenes<00:04:22.060> were<00:04:22.240> much<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.690> entertaining<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.590> a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
scenes were much more entertaining and a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.800 
scenes were much more entertaining and a
that<00:04:24.280> scene<00:04:24.520> was<00:04:24.670> shikaku<00:04:25.150> at<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.360> end<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.720> was

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
that scene was shikaku at the end it was

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.810 
that scene was shikaku at the end it was
handled<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.680> well<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.220> shikaku<00:04:27.700> in

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
handled really well and shikaku in

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.090 
handled really well and shikaku in
general<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.420> slowly<00:04:29.380> but<00:04:29.620> surely<00:04:29.680> becoming

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
general is slowly but surely becoming

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.610 
general is slowly but surely becoming
one<00:04:30.670> of<00:04:30.700> my<00:04:30.910> favorite<00:04:31.300> bees<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.080> maybe

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
one of my favorite bees you and maybe

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.260 
one of my favorite bees you and maybe
that's<00:04:32.890> just<00:04:33.160> going<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.700> become<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
that's just going to have to become a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.110 
that's just going to have to become a
list<00:04:34.990> who<00:04:35.560> my<00:04:35.800> favorite<00:04:36.040> bees<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.580> are<00:04:36.760> from

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
list who my favorite bees you are from

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.260 
list who my favorite bees you are from
10<00:04:37.690> all<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.140> way<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.470> 1<00:04:39.160> stay<00:04:39.850> tuned<00:04:40.030> for<00:04:40.210> that

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270
