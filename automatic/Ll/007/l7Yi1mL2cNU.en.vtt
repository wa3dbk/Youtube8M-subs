00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.449 
didn't know what I was talking about and
and<00:02:19.769> when<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.159> told<00:02:20.519> him<00:02:20.700> then<00:02:20.970> he<00:02:21.920> at<00:02:22.920> least<00:02:23.099> had

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
and when I told him then he at least had

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.360 
and when I told him then he at least had
the<00:02:23.489> goodness<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.390> give<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.799> admit<00:02:26.220> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the goodness to give it up and admit it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.720 
the goodness to give it up and admit it
and<00:02:26.580> he<00:02:27.180> went<00:02:27.659> away<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.530> many<00:02:28.680> years<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
and he went away for for many years so

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.680 
and he went away for for many years so
that<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:30.000> probably<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.510> most<00:02:30.690> rewarding<00:02:31.440> case
