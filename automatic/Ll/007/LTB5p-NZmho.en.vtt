00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.209 
enjoying this game and love now first
let's<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.350> God<00:00:40.829> changed<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
let's think about what God changed the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
let's think about what God changed the
expansion<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.840> um<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
expansion right now first um I think the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
expansion right now first um I think the
most<00:00:44.070> button<00:00:44.370> thing<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> Josh<00:00:45.239> mascara

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
most button thing is that Josh mascara

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
most button thing is that Josh mascara
the<00:00:46.260> new<00:00:46.379> game<00:00:46.559> rather<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.039> he<00:00:47.700> completely

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the new game rather like he completely

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029 
the new game rather like he completely
changed<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> game<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.950> my

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
changed the game now I think in my

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
changed the game now I think in my
opinion<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.460> fixed<00:00:50.730> everything<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.690> bus

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
opinion they fixed everything the bus

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.180 
opinion they fixed everything the bus

or<00:01:38.970> whatever<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:40.729> right<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.119> much

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
or whatever but right now it's much

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.789 
or whatever but right now it's much
better<00:01:42.450> than<00:01:42.630> original<00:01:42.990> diablo<00:01:43.259> 3<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.619> that's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
better than original diablo 3 and that's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.380 
better than original diablo 3 and that's
the<00:01:43.979> important<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.060> other<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the important thing the other thing that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
the important thing the other thing that
can<00:01:45.630> improve<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.020> difficult<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.619> not

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can improve was difficult it's not

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
can improve was difficult it's not
actually<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> meaningful<00:01:47.579> difficulty

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
actually a meaningful difficulty

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
actually a meaningful difficulty
progression<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> recent<00:01:49.680> change

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
progression and if the recent change

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460 
progression and if the recent change
that<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:51.149> let's<00:01:51.299> drop<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.869> high<00:01:52.020> appointment

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that one let's drop on high appointment

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
that one let's drop on high appointment
difficulties<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.850> better<00:01:54.060> because

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
difficulties it's even better because

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
difficulties it's even better because
now<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> high<00:01:55.200> atomic<00:01:55.590> difficult

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
now actually the high atomic difficult

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
now actually the high atomic difficult
this<00:01:56.189> makes<00:01:56.399> sense<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.329> hopefully<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this makes sense and this hopefully it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.230 
this makes sense and this hopefully it
is<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.350> normal<00:01:59.009> mode<00:01:59.189> split<00:01:59.549> farming<00:02:00.000> even

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
is like normal mode split farming even

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.780 
is like normal mode split farming even
if<00:02:00.329> could<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.659> characters<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> stop

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
if could get characters is going to stop

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.280 
if could get characters is going to stop
but<00:02:02.790> also<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> five<00:02:03.869> crusader

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
but also like it is like five crusader

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
but also like it is like five crusader
those<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.040> nice<00:02:05.159> additions<00:02:05.700> but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
those all really nice additions but

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.350 
those all really nice additions but
there<00:02:06.509> was<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.840> expected<00:02:06.960> from<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
there was to be expected from it and

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
there was to be expected from it and
yeah<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.110> best<00:02:10.319> things<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:10.890> like

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
yeah the best things are probably like

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.369 
yeah the best things are probably like
the<00:02:11.580> adventure<00:02:12.209> mode<00:02:12.390> doing<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> bounties

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
the adventure mode doing the bounties

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.680 
the adventure mode doing the bounties
for

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
for

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.450 
for
like<00:02:13.990> not<00:02:14.140> family<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> same<00:02:14.740> song<00:02:15.100> over<00:02:15.280> and

over<00:02:15.580> again<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.450> before<00:02:16.600> but<00:02:17.380> you're<00:02:18.130> able

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
over again like before but you're able

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.680 
over again like before but you're able
to<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.550> different<00:02:18.760> stuff<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
to do a different stuff now and the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.290 
to do a different stuff now and the
gamers<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.320> might<00:02:20.920> even<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.310> or<00:02:21.610> explore<00:02:22.060> song

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
gamers you might even go or explore song

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.480 
gamers you might even go or explore song
so<00:02:22.510> they<00:02:22.570> didn't<00:02:22.840> spend<00:02:23.110> much<00:02:23.140> time<00:02:23.260> before<00:02:23.770> so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
so they didn't spend much time before so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.830 
so they didn't spend much time before so
this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.730> not<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> good<00:02:25.240> thing<00:02:25.360> about<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.660> game

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
this is not a good thing about the game

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.210 
this is not a good thing about the game
and<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.320> been<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> felon<00:02:26.710> rift<00:02:27.040> and

and then we have been a felon rift and
the<00:02:27.910> fellow<00:02:28.090> myths<00:02:28.300> are<00:02:28.450> not<00:02:28.750> fun<00:02:29.080> now<00:02:29.620> already

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010

one<00:04:40.139> imagination<00:04:41.040> behave<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.370> for<00:04:41.520> example<00:04:41.850> if

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
one imagination behave is for example if

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.790 
one imagination behave is for example if
the<00:04:41.970> letter<00:04:42.270> system<00:04:42.750> mode<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.139> going<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.590> be<00:04:43.680> an

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
the letter system mode is going to be an

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.070 
the letter system mode is going to be an
additional<00:04:44.100> mode<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.570> current<00:04:45.810> game

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
additional mode to like the current game

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.480 
additional mode to like the current game
currently<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.680> game<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.130> characters

at the end of the season you're going to

legendaries or bring those letters to
your<00:04:57.540> main<00:04:57.720> characters<00:04:58.230> it's<00:04:58.650> just<00:04:58.800> one<00:04:59.250> thing

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
your main characters it's just one thing

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.980 
your main characters it's just one thing
that<00:04:59.490> goes<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.850> merit<00:05:00.150> now<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.720> might<00:05:00.840> be

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
that goes to merit now it might be

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.240 
that goes to merit now it might be
completely<00:05:01.290> different<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.889> that's

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
completely different but that's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.830 
completely different but that's
something<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.610> see<00:05:02.760> as<00:05:02.940> possible<00:05:03.479> outcome<00:05:03.810> for

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
something I see as possible outcome for

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.719 
something I see as possible outcome for
the<00:05:03.990> letter<00:05:04.200> system<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.770> now<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.490> is

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
the letter system and now this is

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.110 
the letter system and now this is
probably<00:05:06.210> my<00:05:06.419> main<00:05:06.540> thing<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:07.669> kiick<00:05:08.669> rifts

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
probably my main thing you kiick rifts

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.969

about<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.540> you<00:05:24.690> do<00:05:24.780> riff<00:05:25.020> when<00:05:25.919> you<00:05:26.010> clear

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
about this you do riff when you clear

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.379 
about this you do riff when you clear
this<00:05:26.310> with<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.669> as<00:05:26.790> a<00:05:26.820> chance<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.240> get<00:05:27.330> a

this with you as a chance you get a

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.350 
this with you as a chance you get a
greater<00:05:27.660> rift<00:05:27.930> helping<00:05:28.350> from<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:29.360> rift

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
greater rift helping from the rift

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.360 
greater rift helping from the rift
guardian<00:05:30.750> boss<00:05:30.960> at<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.229> end<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.590> if<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.190> do

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
guardian boss at the end and if you do

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.130 
guardian boss at the end and if you do
that<00:05:32.400> successfully<00:05:32.850> you'll<00:05:33.510> get<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.750> greater

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
that successfully you'll get a greater

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.070 
that successfully you'll get a greater
rifky<00:05:34.680> like<00:05:34.979> 210<00:05:35.580> Rick<00:05:35.760> free<00:05:36.060> then<00:05:36.330> rank<00:05:36.539> 4<00:05:36.810> and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
rifky like 210 Rick free then rank 4 and

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.529 
rifky like 210 Rick free then rank 4 and
so<00:05:37.530> on<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.860> now<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.640> comes<00:05:38.850> this<00:05:39.090> is<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.419> the

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
so on and now it comes this is like the

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.140 
so on and now it comes this is like the
most<00:05:39.630> important<00:05:40.080> message<00:05:40.500> much<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.580> seasons

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
most important message much like seasons

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.080 
most important message much like seasons
so<00:05:42.600> this<00:05:42.750> means<00:05:42.900> seasons<00:05:43.760> they<00:05:44.760> are<00:05:44.850> going<00:05:44.970> to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
so this means seasons they are going to

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.640 
so this means seasons they are going to
have<00:05:45.240> leader<00:05:45.510> part<00:05:45.750> is<00:05:45.840> five<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.229> seasons

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
have leader part is five so seasons

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.350 
have leader part is five so seasons
gonna<00:05:46.740> have<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:46.979> leader<00:05:47.190> but<00:05:47.430> we<00:05:47.610> can<00:05:47.760> see<00:05:47.910> how

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
gonna have a leader but we can see how

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.940 
gonna have a leader but we can see how
do<00:05:48.419> you<00:05:48.600> rank<00:05:48.870> compared<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.320> other<00:05:49.440> people<00:05:49.860> in

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
do you rank compared to other people in

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.250 
do you rank compared to other people in
the<00:05:50.039> letter<00:05:50.280> but<00:05:51.000> also<00:05:51.150> like<00:05:51.390> those<00:05:51.630> tier

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
the letter but also like those tier

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.600 
the letter but also like those tier
drifts<00:05:52.800> always<00:05:53.070> gonna<00:05:53.190> have<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.400> leave<00:05:53.520> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
drifts always gonna have to leave the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.680 
drifts always gonna have to leave the
plot<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:53.910> that's<00:05:54.120> all<00:05:54.240> going<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.450> be<00:05:54.570> about

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
plot so that's all going to be about

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.140 
plot so that's all going to be about
okay<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.800> can<00:05:55.919> see<00:05:56.070> who<00:05:56.520> got<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.910> highest

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
okay you can see who got to the highest

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.700 
okay you can see who got to the highest
here<00:05:57.419> if<00:05:57.570> like<00:05:57.750> we<00:05:57.780> actually<00:05:58.139> got<00:05:58.260> to<00:05:58.440> rank

here if like we actually got to rank

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.090 
here if like we actually got to rank
number<00:05:59.240> 97<00:06:00.470> which<00:06:01.470> grew<00:06:01.680> cut<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.919> rank

time they were able to obtain it there's

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.330 
time they were able to obtain it there's
going<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.410> be<00:06:10.440> two<00:06:10.590> different<00:06:10.710> rankings<00:06:11.220> like

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
going to be two different rankings like

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.460 
going to be two different rankings like
first<00:06:11.610> hook<00:06:11.850> up<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.150> furthest<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:12.750> second

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
first hook up the furthest and second

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.070 
first hook up the furthest and second
like<00:06:13.620> who<00:06:14.039> was<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.610> fastest<00:06:15.120> because<00:06:15.419> for

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
like who was the fastest because for

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.719 
like who was the fastest because for
getting<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.500> furthest<00:06:16.889> need<00:06:17.100> a<00:06:17.130> balanced<00:06:17.520> set

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
getting the furthest need a balanced set

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.360 
getting the furthest need a balanced set
up<00:06:17.850> like<00:06:18.030> with<00:06:18.210> a<00:06:18.300> crusader<00:06:18.690> tank<00:06:19.020> or<00:06:19.370> superb

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
up like with a crusader tank or superb

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.750 
up like with a crusader tank or superb
crusade<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:21.350> monk<00:06:22.350> tank<00:06:22.680> and<00:06:22.950> then<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.400> dps

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
crusade and monk tank and then to dps

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.790 
crusade and monk tank and then to dps
might<00:06:24.120> be<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.330> best<00:06:24.510> look<00:06:24.780> at<00:06:24.900> furnace<00:06:25.350> but

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
might be the best look at furnace but

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.840 
might be the best look at furnace but
when<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:25.979> comes<00:06:26.130> something<00:06:26.340> like<00:06:26.580> getting

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
when it comes something like getting

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.879 
when it comes something like getting
there<00:06:27.030> in<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.360> fastest<00:06:27.690> way<00:06:27.720> possible<00:06:27.889> maybe

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
there in the fastest way possible maybe

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.350 
there in the fastest way possible maybe
like<00:06:29.039> fourth<00:06:29.340> less<00:06:29.550> unless<00:06:29.880> it's<00:06:30.060> going<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.240> be

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
like fourth less unless it's going to be

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.930 
like fourth less unless it's going to be
the<00:06:30.510> fastest<00:06:30.840> way<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:31.020> clear<00:06:31.740> those<00:06:32.430> rifts<00:06:32.820> and

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
the fastest way to clear those rifts and

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.730 
the fastest way to clear those rifts and
those<00:06:33.450> are<00:06:33.539> just<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:33.780> few<00:06:33.810> imaginations<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.620> have
