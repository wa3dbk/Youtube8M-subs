00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

I<00:00:00.960> mean<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.650> in<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.890> epic<00:00:02.159> Dahmer<00:00:02.370> these<00:00:02.700> would

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
I mean so in the epic Dahmer these would

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.780 
I mean so in the epic Dahmer these would
be<00:00:03.060> broken<00:00:03.449> down<00:00:03.480> into<00:00:03.659> various<00:00:04.319> discrete<00:00:05.190> so

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
be broken down into various discrete so

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.130 
be broken down into various discrete so
what<00:00:06.000> if<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.509> pieces<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> Evie

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
what if one of the pieces of the Evie

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.379 
what if one of the pieces of the Evie
daughter<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.589> each<00:00:07.680> other<00:00:07.859> today<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.970> in

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
daughter of each other today is that in

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.879 
daughter of each other today is that in
that<00:00:09.540> bottle<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.019> consciousness<00:00:10.530> swelling

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
that bottle of consciousness swelling

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.650 
that bottle of consciousness swelling
through<00:00:11.070> time<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:12.210> learned<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.509> a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
through time we learned about a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.220 
through time we learned about a
perceptual<00:00:13.170> moment<00:00:13.790> there<00:00:14.790> will<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.540> number

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
perceptual moment there will be a number

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.779 
perceptual moment there will be a number
of<00:00:16.590> there's<00:00:17.100> what's<00:00:17.279> called<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> main

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
of there's what's called the main

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.170 
of there's what's called the main
consciousness<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> instance

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
consciousness which is the the instance

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.820 
consciousness which is the the instance
of<00:00:21.240> awareness<00:00:21.480> itself<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.410> then<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.680> has<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
of awareness itself and then it has a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.160 
of awareness itself and then it has a
number<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> facets<00:00:23.820> which<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.510> particular<00:00:24.630> at

pause become so this down the main
consciousness<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> number

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
some of these facets are what we call

I've<00:01:09.720> gotta<00:01:09.930> come<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> four<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:11.700> thinking

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I've gotta come up to four of thinking

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
I've gotta come up to four of thinking
that<00:01:12.240> knowledge<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> relevant<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> yourself

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that knowledge is relevant to yourself

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.120 
that knowledge is relevant to yourself
25<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.619> counted<00:01:16.979> as

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
25 so those are all be counted as

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
25 so those are all be counted as
features<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> attention<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
features of attention and what was the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.070 
features of attention and what was the
element<00:01:19.560> again<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:21.240> job<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> then

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
element again very good job and then

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.570 
element again very good job and then
awareness<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.979> course<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:24.229> intention<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
awareness of course is an intention and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
awareness of course is an intention and
attention<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:26.850> awareness<00:01:27.420> itself<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
attention and then awareness itself is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
attention and then awareness itself is
going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.770> probably<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.549> main

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
going to be probably this main

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
going to be probably this main
consciousness<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> using<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.130> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
consciousness is one way of using it so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.679 
consciousness is one way of using it so
it<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.579> simply<00:01:33.060> equivalent<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it would be simply equivalent of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.609 
it would be simply equivalent of
consciousness<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:36.619> awareness

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
consciousness this is a very awareness

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
consciousness this is a very awareness
is<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> very<00:01:38.130> general<00:01:38.460> term<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.450> also

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is a very general term because we also

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.910 
is a very general term because we also
usually<00:01:39.930> mean<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.750> introduce<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
usually mean it to introduce like a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
usually mean it to introduce like a
moment<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> consciousness<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:46.049> have

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
moment of consciousness in which we have

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.490 
moment of consciousness in which we have
some<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.009> access<00:01:47.579> maybe<00:01:48.509> report<00:01:49.020> ability

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
some kind of access maybe report ability

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.190 
some kind of access maybe report ability
possibly<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.479> difficult<00:01:51.840> ER

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
possibly so that's a very difficult ER

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.719 
possibly so that's a very difficult ER
but<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.770> they're<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.009> easy<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but I think they're very easy to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.390 
but I think they're very easy to
disagree

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
disagree

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.980 
disagree
in<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.820> Buddhist<00:01:55.120> context<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.750> don't

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
in the Buddhist context they don't

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
in the Buddhist context they don't
really<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.830> overlap<00:01:57.280> they<00:01:57.700> come<00:01:57.940> together

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
really have overlap they come together

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.320 
really have overlap they come together
in<00:01:59.170> fact<00:01:59.530> according<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.700> theory<00:02:00.970> if<00:02:01.150> they

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
in fact according to this theory if they

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.210 
in fact according to this theory if they
always<00:02:01.840> come<00:02:02.080> together<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.650> always<00:02:03.040> have

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
always come together you always have

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.000 
always come together you always have
intention<00:02:03.850> attention<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:05.080> five<00:02:05.500> functions

that<00:02:06.370> always<00:02:06.580> occurs<00:02:07.000> every<00:02:07.360> moment<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
that always occurs every moment and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.980 
that always occurs every moment and
intention<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.100> attention<00:02:09.670> or<00:02:10.240> attention<00:02:10.570> or

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
two of them and of course the moment

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.690 
two of them and of course the moment
itself<00:02:12.820> is<00:02:13.060> awareness<00:02:14.190> moment<00:02:15.190> consciousness

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
itself is awareness moment consciousness

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.970 
itself is awareness moment consciousness
so<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> don't<00:02:17.140> think<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.410> any<00:02:17.590> problem<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
so but I don't think is any problem this

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.630 
so but I don't think is any problem this

these<00:03:04.780> facets<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.440> awareness<00:03:05.769> or

these facets of awareness or

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.530 
these facets of awareness or
consciousness<00:03:06.280> are<00:03:06.850> understood<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> be

consciousness are understood to be

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.370 
consciousness are understood to be
almost<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.310> sort<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.340> mental<00:03:09.760> atoms<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:11.230> as

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
almost like sort of mental atoms just as

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.620 
almost like sort of mental atoms just as
there<00:03:11.560> are<00:03:11.680> atoms<00:03:12.100> like<00:03:12.160> they<00:03:12.940> had<00:03:13.090> an<00:03:13.180> atomic

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
there are atoms like they had an atomic

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.630 
there are atoms like they had an atomic
theory<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.959> matter<00:03:14.050> they<00:03:14.920> also<00:03:15.100> had<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.370> kind<00:03:15.610> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
theory of matter they also had a kind of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.070 
theory of matter they also had a kind of
atomic<00:03:15.910> theory<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> mind<00:03:16.600> where<00:03:16.959> there

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
atomic theory of the mind where there

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.110 
atomic theory of the mind where there
are<00:03:17.200> these<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.530> discrete<00:03:18.040> mental<00:03:18.580> elements

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
are these are discrete mental elements

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.440 
are these are discrete mental elements
that<00:03:19.750> occurred<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.230> in<00:03:20.350> various<00:03:21.010> combinations

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that occurred it in various combinations

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.509 
that occurred it in various combinations
later<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:23.110> opinion<00:03:23.680> develops<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.280> I

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
later the opinion develops that I

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.830 
later the opinion develops that I
actually<00:03:24.820> autumn<00:03:25.360> there's<00:03:25.570> just

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
actually autumn there's just

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720 
actually autumn there's just
consciousness<00:03:26.440> itself<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.890> sort<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.459> piece

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
consciousness itself a sort of a piece

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.330 
consciousness itself a sort of a piece
but<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.750> can<00:03:28.989> conceptually<00:03:29.410> distinguish

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
but you can conceptually distinguish

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.699 
but you can conceptually distinguish
different<00:03:30.370> facets<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.390> consciousness<00:03:32.019> but

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
different facets of consciousness but

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.250 
different facets of consciousness but
actually<00:03:33.070> it's<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.519> one<00:03:33.760> piece<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.989> it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
actually it's all just one piece so it's

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.860 
actually it's all just one piece so it's
something<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.709> saying<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.420> color<00:03:37.780> of

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
something like saying that the color of

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
something like saying that the color of
light<00:03:38.320> enlighten<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.220> might<00:03:39.370> say<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.820> can

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
light enlighten you might say you can

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.120 
light enlighten you might say you can
talk<00:03:40.090> about<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.870> red<00:03:41.140> color<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.950> light

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
talk about the red color of the light

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.590 
talk about the red color of the light
but<00:03:42.370> actually<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.790> redness<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.420> light

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
but actually the redness and the light

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.740 
but actually the redness and the light
are<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> same<00:03:44.140> thing<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.120> that's<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.480> opinion

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
are the same thing so that's the opinion

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.090 
are the same thing so that's the opinion
that's<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.200> way<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:47.380> develops<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.950> end

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
that's the way it develops in the end

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.430 
that's the way it develops in the end
yeah<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.120> don't<00:03:49.299> want<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:49.900> too<00:03:50.140> much<00:03:50.170> more

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
yeah I don't want to have too much more

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.930 
yeah I don't want to have too much more
time

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
time

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.690 
time
in<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:52.850> way<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:55.400> understanding<00:03:56.400> these

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
in the way of understanding these

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.130 
in the way of understanding these
concepts<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.210> actually<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.570> some<00:03:57.720> ways<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.930> lot

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
concepts is actually in some ways a lot

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.680 
concepts is actually in some ways a lot
clearer<00:03:58.740> than<00:03:59.400> what<00:03:59.790> Western<00:04:00.060> philosophers

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
clearer than what Western philosophers

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.660 
clearer than what Western philosophers
currently<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.350> say<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.710> it<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
currently have to say is it the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.570 
currently have to say is it the
discussion<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.300> attention<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.050> awareness

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
discussion of attention and awareness

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.760 
discussion of attention and awareness
and<00:04:05.580> intention<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.320> actually<00:04:07.320> kind<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.530> fraud

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
and intention is actually kind of fraud

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.470 
and intention is actually kind of fraud
a<00:04:07.920> lot<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.130> controversy<00:04:08.730> right<00:04:08.910> now<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.300> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
a lot of controversy right now it I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.020 
a lot of controversy right now it I
always<00:04:09.780> say<00:04:09.900> very<00:04:10.110> generally<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.160> usual

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
always say very generally that the usual

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.500 
always say very generally that the usual
sense<00:04:12.210> of<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.360> words<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.900> awareness<00:04:13.260> is

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
sense of the words is that awareness is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.050 
sense of the words is that awareness is
is<00:04:15.510> anything<00:04:15.930> funnel<00:04:16.620> anything<00:04:17.160> felt<00:04:17.640> lived

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
is anything funnel anything felt lived

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
is anything funnel anything felt lived
through<00:04:19.670> whereas<00:04:20.670> attention<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:22.010> some<00:04:23.010> kind

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
through whereas attention is some kind

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.890 
through whereas attention is some kind
of<00:04:23.220> selective<00:04:23.610> function<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.750> can

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
of selective function and that can

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.210 
of selective function and that can
happen<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.230> different<00:04:25.500> ways<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.950> could<00:04:26.010> happen

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
happen in different ways it could happen

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.470 
happen in different ways it could happen
because<00:04:26.490> something<00:04:27.000> grabs<00:04:27.270> your<00:04:27.450> attention

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
because something grabs your attention

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.380 
because something grabs your attention
externally<00:04:28.320> you're<00:04:29.220> walking<00:04:30.180> along

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
externally you're walking along

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.450 
externally you're walking along
something<00:04:31.260> moves<00:04:31.560> quickly<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.130> periphery

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
something moves quickly in the periphery

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400 
something moves quickly in the periphery
of<00:04:32.520> your<00:04:32.670> visual<00:04:33.000> field<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.420> look<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.170> way

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
of your visual field and look that way

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.050 
of your visual field and look that way
or<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.730> can<00:04:35.850> happen<00:04:36.030> through<00:04:36.600> some<00:04:37.470> kind<00:04:37.710> of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
or it can happen through some kind of

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
or it can happen through some kind of
volition<00:04:39.060> on<00:04:39.150> your<00:04:39.360> part<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:39.810> there's<00:04:39.960> a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
volition on your part so there's a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.280 
volition on your part so there's a
there's<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> so-called<00:04:41.340> kind<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.000> top-down<00:04:42.300> I

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
there's a so-called kind of top-down I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.050 
there's a so-called kind of top-down I
don't<00:04:43.980> like<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.100> pretty<00:04:44.310> executive<00:04:44.790> but<00:04:44.910> that's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
don't like a pretty executive but that's

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.770 
don't like a pretty executive but that's
where<00:04:45.240> people<00:04:45.480> whose<00:04:46.010> attention<00:04:47.010> where<00:04:47.400> you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
where people whose attention where you

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.140 
where people whose attention where you
where<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.810> deliver<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.830> 10<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.790> something

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
where you deliver the 10 to something

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.610 
where you deliver the 10 to something
but<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.450> idea<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:51.720> basically<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.230> attention

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
but the idea is basically of attention

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.140 
but the idea is basically of attention
is<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.860> there's<00:04:53.040> some<00:04:53.190> kind<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.460> selection

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
is that there's some kind of selection

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.120 
is that there's some kind of selection
and<00:04:54.450> hence<00:04:54.630> enhancement<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.410> some<00:04:55.680> features

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
and hence enhancement of some features

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.909 
and hence enhancement of some features
within<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:57.000> broad<00:04:57.360> field<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.169> awareness<00:04:58.290> and

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
within a broad field of awareness and

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.560 
within a broad field of awareness and
then<00:04:59.430> in<00:04:59.610> intention<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:01.970> very<00:05:02.970> much<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.480> idea

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
then in intention is very much the idea

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.060 
then in intention is very much the idea
of<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:05.190> kind<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:06.110> directedness<00:05:07.110> with<00:05:07.650> an<00:05:07.770> action

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
of a kind of directedness with an action

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.360 
of a kind of directedness with an action
tendency<00:05:09.440> which<00:05:10.440> would<00:05:10.590> be<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.710> mental<00:05:11.070> action

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
tendency which would be a mental action

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.950 
tendency which would be a mental action
in<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.640> your<00:05:11.850> cookie<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.390> know<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.510> physical

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
in is your cookie of you know a physical

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.500 
in is your cookie of you know a physical
body<00:05:13.290> would<00:05:13.830> be<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.580> sense<00:05:15.240> it's<00:05:15.390> very

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
body would be in that sense it's very

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.170 
body would be in that sense it's very
closely<00:05:15.750> with<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.860> what<00:05:17.160> literally<00:05:17.850> moves

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
closely with is what literally moves

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.480 
closely with is what literally moves
human<00:05:18.600> moves<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:19.020> mine<00:05:19.200> is<00:05:19.440> in<00:05:19.919> tension<00:05:20.250> or

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
human moves of mine is in tension or

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.640 
human moves of mine is in tension or
contention<00:05:21.000> for<00:05:21.090> objects<00:05:21.690> toward<00:05:22.140> objects

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
contention for objects toward objects

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.560 
contention for objects toward objects
yeah<00:05:22.800> wish<00:05:23.220> with<00:05:23.400> mental<00:05:23.760> objects<00:05:24.120> there<00:05:24.300> eat

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
yeah wish with mental objects there eat

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.720 
yeah wish with mental objects there eat
me<00:05:24.810> as<00:05:25.080> well<00:05:25.760> but<00:05:28.040> there<00:05:29.040> was<00:05:29.160> much<00:05:29.940> mentioned
