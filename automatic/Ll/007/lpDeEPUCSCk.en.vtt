00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
this one it's a bit confusing but and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
this one it's a bit confusing but and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
software that I use and that when I go

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
software that I use and that when I go
off<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> game<00:00:29.449> which<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> path<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.349> aim

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
off the game which is a path which aim

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650

it stopped recording on the video going

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
it stopped recording on the video going
to<00:00:33.719> save<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.130> still<00:00:35.340> in

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to save so that's how you are still in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.090

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I'll put them in the output an

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.880 
I'll put them in the output an
inscription<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.030> then<00:00:42.590> we'll<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.829> there

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
inscription and then we'll go from there

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
inscription and then we'll go from there
