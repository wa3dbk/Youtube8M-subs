years and built this movie on it I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.970 
years and built this movie on it I
couldn't<00:01:02.540> believe<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.080> effort<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.890> the

couldn't believe the effort and the
authenticity<00:01:04.760> something<00:01:05.720> that's<00:01:05.870> been<00:01:06.020> built

we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> work<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.150> technically<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
we have to work it out technically the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.900 
we have to work it out technically the
technology<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.860> caught<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.430> us<00:01:26.460> such<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
technology has caught up with us such a

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.610 
technology has caught up with us such a
way<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.420> movie<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.900> Green<00:01:28.140> Lantern<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
way to a movie like Green Lantern is

way to a movie like Green Lantern is
finally<00:01:29.070> possible<00:01:29.220> recreating<00:01:30.030> our<00:01:30.330> was

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
finally possible recreating our was

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.290 
finally possible recreating our was
massive<00:01:31.560> build<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.190> was<00:01:32.580> always<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
massive build that was always going to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.030 
massive build that was always going to
be<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.600> big<00:01:33.810> challenge<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> film<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.740> see

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
be a big challenge for the film but see

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.840 
be a big challenge for the film but see
ya<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.420> decided<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.470> were<00:01:37.560> gonna<00:01:37.620> build<00:01:37.890> Oh<00:01:38.250> out

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
ya we decided we were gonna build Oh out

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.360 
ya we decided we were gonna build Oh out
to<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.720> great<00:01:39.990> amount<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> detail<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
to a great amount of detail there was a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.680 
to a great amount of detail there was a
lot<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.550> pressure<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.120> get<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.600> know

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
lot of pressure to get you know

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.870 
lot of pressure to get you know
everything<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.400> doesn't<00:01:44.610> matter

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
everything just right it doesn't matter

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
everything just right it doesn't matter
if<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> small<00:01:46.080> building<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
