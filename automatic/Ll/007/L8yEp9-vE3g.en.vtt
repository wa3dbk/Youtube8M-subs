 trick judgment I would say my god 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.469
 I'm so excited every single time 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.719
 pink slip with me a fluttering high 100 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.660
 look at this topic already 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 lewis friends are there again 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.519
 Also, let's have a look right now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 We will play like that today 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 once freed was so easy on 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 Schmocker let's see what will go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 maybe we will lose 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.689
 We win, yes, you just know it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
 not as much as in any case 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.650
 Alright , I would say that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.650
 but no matter how young is strong 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.280
 potpara goes through with a message 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.380
 destroyed we have to go here now 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.060
 Loosely put on attack attack times 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.880
 look what is going to happen we have here 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 Definitely ibo and that is fast 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 is the resulting mean not coming 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.530
 through friends we play today 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.420
 bit on the bed the fashion maybe 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.770
 with a few skills but we 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.209
 play today dropouts and have now 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.920
 we have sent here he draws directly 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:52.280
 time on castro on victory 1 0 0 go and that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.819
 so on the victory after eleven minutes a yes 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.149
 here it goes say alena 860 beautiful 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.880
 made where the hell out of nowhere 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.229
 always 10 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.439
 there came young we need the ball here 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.030
 we have to do about 20 here and here 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.950
 have synonymous directly over but my 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 god is that a monster is that one 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:22.840
 monster now he is trying on the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:31.519
 eat flown 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.290
 well I'm leaving david luiz what 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.660
 because with the going so I praised this 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.790
 defense with cassis and how they all 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 hot just leave a chunk is so 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.180
 If I want to see that, he does not want to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.010
 betrayed as well comes through 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.189
 what does the goalkeeper alex me on the ass 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.870
 do not lick the market but not the train 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.090
 that 's not what it was 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.409
 because you have me for a duseltor 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.599
 want to fool me 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.420
 that makes the whole skills to word here 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.370
 the one from here we have packed 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.890
 because when it comes to here now it works 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.250
 but coming because people counter-zag 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.450
 makes her wonderful movie happens often 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:15.689
 andrea yes come on we are through says 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.689
 always over the flank comes as meets 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.480
 and there was made candreva harbor here 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.129
 brought good triplets and then is 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.129
 Of course, this is only a head thing 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.299
 wonderful friends take care of this now 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.720
 You pass this pass 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.720
 Shit in accordance with 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.819
 unfortunately no gate but that was real now 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.349
 that the good has been too much but hardly 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.910
 asamoah kwadwo asamoah was wonderful 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.069
 perfect this is wonderfully distal 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.110
 itself on the ground comes the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.690
 flank in there is again 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.180
 dollar june around here is something going on 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.700
 today is the real peat festival at the start 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.900
 Parag agarwal here bring a flank 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.090
 and almost says soo friends too 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.470
 with the first half-time as they see 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.820
 we are a little bit better though 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.139
 the enemy does not have to play bad 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.790
 I say there has good money 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.560
 been a bit swat here today 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.300
 on the way because I thought comes 352 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.740
 had to get out so if someone 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.090
 you definitely wanted to win 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.710
 this team is just outstanding 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.760
 You can also do it yourself 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.990
 bit you have seen yes 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.320
 is not so pretty I do not believe 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.030
 gate 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.370
 where not a two skills were involved 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.200
 unfortunately only the three stars but there 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.130
 he almost the hire was well played 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.479
 think marco reus what can you do down there 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.940
 you can read it a free asamoah 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.190
 asamoah of'm easy it bites 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.410
 not always roulette in the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.260
 shot through in the double all 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.130
 Quaresma played wonderful there goes 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.840
 thus the patience gives you as ever 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.720
 I can but also fallrückzieher 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.310
 then we have the advantage 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.560
 here 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.570
 pity cambiasso leather is simple 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.669
 hammer koma again by this is there 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.080
 interspersed and then the thick mistake 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.930
 plays and then it becomes the 1 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.639
 at that time lucky so had nothing to attack 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.470
 Now on asamoah the easy on 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.860
 Do you have something to do? 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.770
 Day 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.800
 he quote back saying that you 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.750
 wonderful and sat young with the shot 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.479
 but again that was unfortunately not there 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.430
 it initiates the counter and plays 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.550
 now the high what was what is doing 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.090
 The goalkeeper since my goodness almost 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.400
 rang 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.050
 that is really bitter because you have to 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.340
 now say is so high already here 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.379
 that does not really play fair 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.750
 very good came next attack now say 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.569
 you look up here now already 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.030
 Combination game Chic Mario Gomez 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.469
 mario gomez he has the paintings brown 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 tunnelled but then david luiz is there 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.360
 is just something of strong and then 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.909
 My technician had been scatted off first 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.300
 really nice, but now 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.300
 Candreva 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.129
 it almost went in and now I think so 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.020
 still my corner look what he has 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.550
 now before 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.979
 now he plays us dizzy that 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.229
 skin in there was a nice goal from the opponent 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.400
 here I think agüero what else can he do 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.409
 Let's get in the we are already in the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.650
 ninetieth yes friends that was it 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.939
 game we have 4 2 against stefan of 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.120
 joystiq won look like times 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.319
 passing them makes quite good videos 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.830
 and then yes I would say we have 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.659
 We have our friends now 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.949
 we won the match we have to match 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.740
 I say I really did like it 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.509
 likes to look at stefan by joe tastic 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.279
 It has to be played really well 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.439
 I just say so we have those now 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.659

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:54.930

 a hammer player yes thank you 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.509

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.060
