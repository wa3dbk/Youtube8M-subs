so<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.270> simple<00:00:43.100> there's<00:00:44.100> our

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so first we're so simple there's our

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.500 
so first we're so simple there's our
multi-touch<00:00:44.640> career<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> floating

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
multi-touch career so it's a floating

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
multi-touch career so it's a floating
app<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.350> here's<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.460> abs

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
app so here's I don't have all my abs
and<00:00:47.969> stuff<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.590> shows<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.129> let's<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and stuff so it shows that so let's just

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.049 
and stuff so it shows that so let's just
put<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> side<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:52.100> also<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
put that on the side here I also have a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.869 
put that on the side here I also have a
video<00:00:54.930> player<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.219> queued<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
video player that is queued so this is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:09.710 
video player that is queued so this is
just<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.030> basic<00:01:00.500> mp4<00:01:01.500> video<00:01:08.540> just<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just a basic mp4 video just make a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
just a basic mp4 video just make a
little<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.080> bigger<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.530> expanding<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
little bit bigger by expanding it just

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.300 
little bit bigger by expanding it just
like<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.080> smaller

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.690 

I'm<00:01:19.000> just<00:01:19.090> going<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.329> pause<00:01:19.509> that<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:21.310> have

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
I'm just going to pause that I also have

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.760 
I'm just going to pause that I also have
a<00:01:22.000> app<00:01:22.600> for<00:01:23.500> YouTube<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.939> also<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:25.770> for

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
a app for YouTube that also is for

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.310 
a app for YouTube that also is for
multitasking<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.659> multitask<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
multitasking going to multitask the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.980 
multitasking going to multitask the
window<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.729> essentially<00:01:34.180> I'll<00:01:34.509> have<00:01:36.990> two

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
window so essentially I'll have two

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.669 
window so essentially I'll have two
videos<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.770> online<00:01:39.750> an<00:01:40.750> actual<00:01:41.200> video<00:01:41.470> playing

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
videos on online an actual video playing

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.440 
videos on online an actual video playing
youtube<00:01:42.429> video<00:01:42.729> plus<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.119> your<00:01:43.210> calculator

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
youtube video plus on your calculator

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:56.370 
youtube video plus on your calculator
all<00:01:43.960> working<00:01:44.890> on<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.070> background

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.360 

and<00:01:58.079> calculator<00:01:59.079> works<00:01:59.710> as<00:01:59.920> well

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.210 

so<00:02:05.370> as<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.910> see<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:06.600> shows<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.220> multi-vue

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so as you can see it shows the multi-vue

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.300 
so as you can see it shows the multi-vue
and<00:02:08.400> also<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.970> even<00:02:09.290> show<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:10.320> even<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.250> the

and also I can even show you even in the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.590 
and also I can even show you even in the
background<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.850> have<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:13.110> internet<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:14.600> so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
background we have the internet going so

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.810 
background we have the internet going so
I<00:02:15.690> even<00:02:15.960> wanted<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.160> trying<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.460> show

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you like the capability of the process

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
you like the capability of the process
or<00:02:19.680> multitasking<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:21.290> I'm

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
or multitasking and it's pretty I'm

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
or multitasking and it's pretty I'm
pretty<00:02:22.320> sure<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.700> an

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
pretty sure you this can be done on an

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.820 
pretty sure you this can be done on an
iPad<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.050> pretty<00:02:28.170> interesting<00:02:28.290> how

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
iPad so this is pretty interesting how

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.100 
iPad so this is pretty interesting how
the<00:02:28.890> power<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.000> processor<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.750> actually

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the power of the processor can actually

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.620 
the power of the processor can actually
do<00:02:31.260> full<00:02:31.590> multitasking<00:02:32.400> with<00:02:33.030> two<00:02:33.300> videos

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
do full multitasking with two videos

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
do full multitasking with two videos
playing<00:02:34.310> simultaneously<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.670> even

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
playing simultaneously and you can even

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.310 
playing simultaneously and you can even
make<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.210> bigger<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.170> wish<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.080> far

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
make them bigger if I wish but so far

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.590 
make them bigger if I wish but so far
