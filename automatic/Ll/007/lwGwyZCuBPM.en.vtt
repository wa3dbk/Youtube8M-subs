00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.290
 for its 40th edition the rally of 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.840
 condroz can count this year on a 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.849
 Guest star Sebastian loeb nine times 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.160
 world champion in wrc is indeed 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.010
 on the departure a first for the whole 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.080
 recent retiree of the world championship 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.430
 is well wet so I think it's ok 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.260
 to be very tricky for a first 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.630
 experience one is served but at the same 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 time when coming here we expected a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.040
 little bit but otherwise 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.830
 a lot of people it's a beautiful rally 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.300
 very popular so it's fun 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.920
 do what to have his wife like 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 copilot 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 it changes a little and then we 're done 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 that's because we're here to have fun 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 has no particular ambition 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 so this is an opportunity to be 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 pleasure from time to time she likes 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.840
 so we try to do it once 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 per year so I start a little bit 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 the habit it's been a dozen times 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 that we do together the rallies but 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 it is true that it is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.589
 it's always nice it's moments 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.030
 to give a good weekend we have fun and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.120
 we are here why take pleasure 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.370
 do you manage well your role of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 co-pilot down and I have no choice because 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.360
 that he's set super pro take the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 remains and hyper professional even though 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.070
 the right to have fun not if we're here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.020
 to just have fun but it's true 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 that he still wants it to be friendly 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 corrected dance note it comes check if 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 I do not say no, but it remains 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 pro until the end it's not going 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.830
 fail to make rallies in 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 championship I think no because 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.950
 I will always have the opportunity to do this 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 kind of rally if I want and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 then I have other goals other 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.649
 ambition now is this very long 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.850
 wtcc next year so there's a lot of 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.439
 work and then 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.570
 our way of managing all expectations 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.360
 so that's motivating the navigation a 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.150
 little word on thierry neuville ben 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 neuville 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.630
 proved this year that he was who has 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.440
 been not bad he has progressed well I 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 thought 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.480
 it's a bit of a surprise this year 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.630
 to see that he had managed to pass the course 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.760
 to be reliable fast constant so so 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.960
 to arrive there is 2 in the championship and I 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.960
 think it's promising
