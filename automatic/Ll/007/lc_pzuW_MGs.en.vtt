bad<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.230> ups<00:02:32.379> with<00:02:32.530> water<00:02:33.930> because<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.530> get

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
bad in ups with water because you get

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.920 
bad in ups with water because you get
blinded<00:02:36.069> when<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.640> water<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
blinded when you go to the water and I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.210 
blinded when you go to the water and I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
think that there's a hacker in this game

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.789 
think that there's a hacker in this game
I<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:40.810> want<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.019> call<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.530> call<00:02:41.680> this

game<00:02:42.040> hackers<00:02:42.430> mark<00:02:42.700> 4<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:47.410> seems

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
game hackers mark 4 because and it seems

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.860 
game hackers mark 4 because and it seems
that<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:48.340> video<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:49.060> gonna<00:02:49.180> consist<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.750> me

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
that this video is gonna consist of me

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.580
