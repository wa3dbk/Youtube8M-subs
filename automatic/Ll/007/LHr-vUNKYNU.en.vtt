guys before that's like a normal digital
camera<00:05:25.080> normal<00:05:25.410> point-and-shoot<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.070> know

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
camera normal point-and-shoot you know

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.880 
camera normal point-and-shoot you know
so<00:05:26.760> this<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.150> high<00:05:27.330> end<00:05:27.570> point<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.260> where

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
so this is the high end point you where

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.950 
so this is the high end point you where
the<00:05:29.100> only<00:05:29.520> difference<00:05:30.360> between<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:30.900> and

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
the only difference between this and

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.110 
the only difference between this and
learn<00:05:31.560> one<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.980> slrs<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:32.880> can't

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
learn one of the slrs that you can't

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.900 
learn one of the slrs that you can't
change<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.660> lens<00:05:33.900> so<00:05:34.320> that's<00:05:35.010> what<00:05:35.400> was

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
change the lens so that's what was

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.790 
change the lens so that's what was
what's<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.360> difference<00:05:36.690> probably<00:05:37.650> be

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
what's the difference probably be

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.520 
what's the difference probably be
between<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.430> as<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.940> digital<00:05:39.420> SLR<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:39.930> the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
between the as the digital SLR and the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.910 
between the as the digital SLR and the
then<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.640> one<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.060> know<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.480> it's<00:05:43.230> it<00:05:43.650> and

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
then this one you know so it's it and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.410 
then this one you know so it's it and
