00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:11.049
 Here is correct 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:14.050
 Separately stick if I do not I the other one second bread most probably to 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.519
 I do not tell you because I do not tell you 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.160
 3 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.480
 Ahead is a much better value ordering 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.120
 This or grandchild 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.920
 You 're out 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.920
 Does Mase excess oil there Tei 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.050
 Because I put the oil that Honda had 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.050
 But after What 's also the oil Shari 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.540
 It looks like this 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.940
 That also want a little or not you want standing is behind because you do not put towards people Airport behind 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.840
 This is adorned that 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.840
 It is because you do not attach 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.600
 There was a little bit more 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.930
 Four days 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:07.220
 And timing to Karst is from is dry around this 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.990
 Be sure to check that it is bought and removed 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.930
 Ok 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.130
 If it does not come off 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.900
 I can not return it 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.030
 Teru 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.790
 It's hot, everyone is different 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.880
 You may do it really 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:31.750
 Well it does not become a de so also I'm That's the mouse 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 I guess it's really delicious 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.270
 It is convenient, so I do not mind if there is only oil for processing fluorocarbons, but it looks like paper 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 You can make it 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.640
 It is to make it so thin 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.930
 It is good 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.270
 Because there is time to dry if you put in a lot for the time being 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.850
 There is baked eye is made 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 Rain water etc 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.730
 It is easy to return because it dries quickly 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 Your 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.010
 I wonder if I burn up quickly or Hayashi Yasu say I mean 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.340
 It is good forever
