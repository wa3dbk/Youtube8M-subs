00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
want to run and both them are running

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750 
want to run and both them are running
native<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.350> hardware<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.459> it's<00:02:39.580> actually

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
native on the hardware so it's actually

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.190 
native on the hardware so it's actually
running<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> full<00:02:40.420> operating<00:02:40.720> system<00:02:41.049> it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
running the full operating system it's

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.870 
running the full operating system it's
not<00:02:41.230> an<00:02:41.410> emulation<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.220> Sony<00:02:42.430> actually

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
not an emulation to Sony actually

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.940 
not an emulation to Sony actually
designed<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> game<00:02:44.680> OS

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
designed it to do this so the game OS

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.550 
designed it to do this so the game OS
has<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> partitioning<00:02:46.030> tool<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.290> actually

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
has a partitioning tool and it actually

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 
has a partitioning tool and it actually
lets<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.799> repartition<00:02:48.400> your<00:02:48.700> hard<00:02:48.910> drive<00:02:49.150> so

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
lets you repartition your hard drive so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.000 
lets you repartition your hard drive so
you<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.780> have<00:02:49.959> both<00:02:50.140> operating<00:02:50.590> system<00:02:50.890> they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
you can have both operating system they

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.160 
you can have both operating system they
don't<00:02:51.190> overlap<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.630> really<00:02:52.840> nice<00:02:52.989> it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
don't overlap so it's really nice it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.690 
don't overlap so it's really nice it
works<00:02:53.319> very<00:02:53.410> well<00:02:53.530> plenty<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.370> room

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
works very well plenty of room

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.580 
works very well plenty of room
yellow-dog<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.690> basic<00:02:56.049> installation<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
yellow-dog the basic installation that

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.110 
yellow-dog the basic installation that
we<00:02:56.709> conduct<00:02:57.040> by<00:02:57.160> default<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.640> only<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:57.940> less

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
we conduct by default is only is less

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.699 
we conduct by default is only is less
than<00:02:58.239> two<00:02:58.390> gigabytes<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.650> much

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
than two gigabytes so it's not that much

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.500 
than two gigabytes so it's not that much
space<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.489> even<00:03:00.670> if<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.850> only<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.239> 20

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510

opportunities<00:03:17.410> question<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.400> really<00:03:18.640> about

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
opportunities question is really about

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.460 
opportunities question is really about
whether<00:03:18.940> or<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.269> there<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.810> accelerated

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
whether or not there is accelerated

show that's so windows centric in our
world<00:03:54.180> everything's<00:03:54.569> Linux<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:55.709> it's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
world everything's Linux and so it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.320

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
been fun to show people what Linux is

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.820 
been fun to show people what Linux is
about<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.810> actually<00:03:58.140> some<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.500> these<00:03:58.590> people

about and actually some of these people
never<00:03:58.980> use<00:03:59.190> Linux<00:03:59.430> before<00:03:59.730> which<00:03:59.880> surprised

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
never use Linux before which surprised

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.030 
never use Linux before which surprised
me<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.050> been<00:04:01.110> fun<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.440> open<00:04:01.530> up<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.830> door
