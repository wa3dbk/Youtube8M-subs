dangerous counterplay for black but in

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.900 
dangerous counterplay for black but in
the<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.290> position<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:32.830> route<00:04:33.250> c7<00:04:33.760> was

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the in a position like this route c7 was

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.380 
the in a position like this route c7 was
a<00:04:33.940> possibility<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:36.550> after<00:04:36.820> we<00:04:36.970> gave<00:04:37.120> six

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
a possibility and then after we gave six

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.530 
a possibility and then after we gave six
I<00:04:37.720> think<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:39.220> winning<00:04:39.520> chances<00:04:39.940> are<00:04:40.150> still<00:04:40.390> on

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
I think the winning chances are still on

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.780 
I think the winning chances are still on
right<00:04:40.690> side<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.530> course<00:04:41.830> not<00:04:42.190> very<00:04:42.460> clear

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.170 
cannot take the night on e six and then
I<00:05:44.620> think<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:46.720> was<00:05:46.960> probably<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.890> best<00:05:48.669> chess

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I think this was probably the best chess

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.659 
I think this was probably the best chess
game<00:05:49.450> of<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.960> whole<00:05:50.140> match<00:05:50.380> I<00:05:50.650> think<00:05:50.950> this<00:05:51.400> was

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
game of the whole match I think this was

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.200 
game of the whole match I think this was
an<00:05:51.820> open<00:05:52.090> battle<00:05:52.419> on<00:05:52.570> both<00:05:53.050> sides<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.650> then<00:05:54.640> in

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
an open battle on both sides and then in

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.340 
an open battle on both sides and then in
fact<00:05:55.930> girlfriend<00:05:56.590> had<00:05:56.800> a<00:05:56.979> winning<00:05:57.250> position

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
fact girlfriend had a winning position

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:06.210 
fact girlfriend had a winning position
after<00:06:00.390> 25<00:06:01.390> 26<00:06:02.320> moves<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.450> he<00:06:05.020> missed<00:06:05.220> the

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
after 25 26 moves but the he missed the

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.990 
after 25 26 moves but the he missed the
winning<00:06:06.430> line<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.350> therefore<00:06:08.350> he<00:06:08.650> only<00:06:09.400> drew

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
winning line and therefore he only drew

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.659 
winning line and therefore he only drew
this<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.330> third<00:06:10.990> game<00:06:11.290> of<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.650> rabbit<00:06:11.979> match<00:06:12.160> so
