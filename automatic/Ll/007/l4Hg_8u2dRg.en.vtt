layers and you'll see the pasted layer

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.849 
layers and you'll see the pasted layer
now<00:01:52.090> rename<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> pasted<00:01:53.630> layer<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.140> lower<00:01:54.350> or

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
now rename the pasted layer and lower or

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.260 
now rename the pasted layer and lower or
lowering<00:01:55.369> or<00:01:55.670> where<00:01:56.420> do<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.630> want<00:01:59.020> now

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
lowering or where do you want now

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.300 
lowering or where do you want now
we<00:02:02.079> can<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:02.350> move<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:03.040> layer<00:02:03.280> around<00:02:05.310> like

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we can now move this layer around like

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.449 
we can now move this layer around like
so<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.690> we<00:02:10.780> need<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:10.989> do<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:12.099> lower<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
so so what we need to do to lower the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.720 
so so what we need to do to lower the
car<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:13.560> move<00:02:14.560> along<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.550> move<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
car is move along now you can move the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.670 
car is move along now you can move the
cars<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.269> low<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.660> want<00:02:19.840> depending<00:02:20.380> on

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
cars as low as you want depending on

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.040 
cars as low as you want depending on
what<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.890> want<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.099> do<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:25.420> say<00:02:25.690> about<00:02:25.840> that
