00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
to know this song is in three four

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.760 
to know this song is in three four
timing<00:01:07.250> which<00:01:07.670> basically<00:01:08.000> means<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.770> this

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
timing which basically means that this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.130 
timing which basically means that this
the<00:01:10.280> hardest<00:01:10.700> strum<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.210> on<00:01:11.360> every<00:01:11.660> third<00:01:11.899> beat

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
the hardest strum is on every third beat

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
the hardest strum is on every third beat
so<00:01:12.590> it'll<00:01:12.770> sound<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.009> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
