than one minor issue in that the cutout
at<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> back<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> stove<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:23.210> there's<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
at the back of the stove is there's a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.679 
at the back of the stove is there's a
cutout<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.810> back<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.689> gas

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
cutout in the back for the for the gas

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.650 
cutout in the back for the for the gas
pipe<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.529> sit<00:00:29.189> inside<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.730> stove<00:00:30.210> there's<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
pipe to sit inside the stove there's a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030 
pipe to sit inside the stove there's a
little<00:00:30.750> notch<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.830> push<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
little notch in there so you can push it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.170 
little notch in there so you can push it
all<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.430> against<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> wall<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
all the way back against the wall and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.620 
all the way back against the wall and
unfortunately<00:00:33.750> our<00:00:33.809> pipe<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.500> higher<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.640> than

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
unfortunately our pipe is higher up than

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.119 
unfortunately our pipe is higher up than
the<00:00:36.840> notch<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> gap

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
the notch and so I can see there's a gap

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
the notch and so I can see there's a gap
behind<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.399> stove<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.090> can't<00:00:42.300> push<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
behind the stove because I can't push it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.700 
behind the stove because I can't push it
all<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.840> back<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.440> hitting

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
all the way back because it's hitting

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
all the way back because it's hitting
the<00:00:43.800> pipe<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:45.809> point<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.230> future

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the pipe so at some point in the future

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
the pipe so at some point in the future
maybe<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.180> punch<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> hole<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> other

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
maybe I can punch a hole on the other

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600 
maybe I can punch a hole on the other
side<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> wall<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.289> lower<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> gas<00:00:50.309> pipe

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
side of the wall and lower the gas pipe

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
side of the wall and lower the gas pipe
but<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> sit

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
but for right now it's just going to sit

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.319 
but for right now it's just going to sit
away<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> wall<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.059> bit<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
away from the wall a little bit and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
away from the wall a little bit and
always<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> deal<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
always have to deal with that but the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
always have to deal with that but the
door<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:56.940> open<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.360> checked<00:00:57.600> its<00:00:57.809> clears<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
door does open I checked its clears to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
door does open I checked its clears to
it<00:00:58.980> opens<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.789> clears<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> fridge<00:01:00.390> but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it opens and it clears the fridge but

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
it opens and it clears the fridge but
look<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.890> tightly<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.180> fits

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
look at how tightly this all fits

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.010 
look at how tightly this all fits
together<00:01:03.890> there<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.729> tiny<00:01:06.180> sliver<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
together there is just a tiny sliver of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
together there is just a tiny sliver of
space<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.860> between<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> cabinets<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
space in between the cabinets here the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.740 
space in between the cabinets here the
dishwasher<00:01:10.350> fits<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.460> perfectly<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this base cabins got to go in still I'm

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.929 
this base cabins got to go in still I'm
going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> put<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.280> ahead<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.850> had

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
going to put it all back ahead and I had

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
going to put it all back ahead and I had
to<00:01:21.240> cut<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> notch<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> would

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to cut a notch out here so that it would

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
to cut a notch out here so that it would
fit<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> from<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> molding<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.650> mean<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
fit in from this molding but I mean that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.600 
fit in from this molding but I mean that
the<00:01:26.549> tolerances<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.720> astonishing<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the tolerances are just astonishing and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
the tolerances are just astonishing and

I'm<00:02:03.030> fairly<00:02:03.420> proud<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:04.979> how

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
I'm fairly proud of this look at how

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'm fairly proud of this look at how
well<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> water<00:02:06.090> line<00:02:06.329> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
well that's the water line going to the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.850 
well that's the water line going to the
going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> ice<00:02:08.100> maker<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:09.600> at<00:02:09.720> how

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
going to the ice maker and look at how

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
going to the ice maker and look at how
perfectly<00:02:10.860> fit<00:02:11.310> everything<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.780> inside<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
perfectly fit everything is inside the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.070 
perfectly fit everything is inside the
cabinet<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.490> cabinet<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> exactly<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
cabinet the cabinet is in exactly the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.510 
cabinet the cabinet is in exactly the
right<00:02:16.200> position<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.740> supposed<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
right position we're supposed to be and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.820 
right position we're supposed to be and
it<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.910> clears<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.870> edge<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.230> pipe<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it just clears the edge of that pipe and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.170 
it just clears the edge of that pipe and
it<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.190> clears<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.760> edge<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.380> handle

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
it just clears the edge of that handle

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.150 
it just clears the edge of that handle
so<00:02:24.180> all<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.620> plumbing<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.310> neatly<00:02:27.180> inside<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
so all the plumbing is neatly inside the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
so all the plumbing is neatly inside the
appropriate<00:02:29.160> cabinet<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.670> don't<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.000> cut

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
appropriate cabinet I don't have to cut

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.970 
appropriate cabinet I don't have to cut
any<00:02:30.330> edges<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.050> cabinets<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.800> make<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
any edges of cabinets out to make a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.490 
any edges of cabinets out to make a
plumbing<00:02:32.340> fit<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.630> I'll<00:02:33.750> slid<00:02:34.170> right<00:02:34.319> into

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
plumbing fit and I'll slid right into

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.479 
plumbing fit and I'll slid right into
place<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:36.739> couldn't<00:02:37.739> ask<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.370> go

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
place so couldn't ask for it to go

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.860 
place so couldn't ask for it to go
together<00:02:38.640> better<00:02:39.030> hopefully<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.540> other<00:02:39.660> side

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
together better hopefully the other side

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.479 
together better hopefully the other side
will<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.080> equally<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.650> delightful<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
will be equally as delightful and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.580 
will be equally as delightful and
everything<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.660> goes<00:02:42.810> overhead<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.410> fit

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
everything that goes overhead will fit

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.979 
everything that goes overhead will fit
just<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.950> well<00:02:44.100> too<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:45.540> back<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> work

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
just as well too so not back to work

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.350 
just as well too so not back to work
i'll<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.130> another<00:02:47.310> follow-up<00:02:47.670> video<00:02:47.940> when

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
i'll have another follow-up video when
