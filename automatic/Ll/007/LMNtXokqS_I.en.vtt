they're really sexy the first is kind of

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.470 
they're really sexy the first is kind of
subtle<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.100> there's<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.210> little<00:04:02.390> bit

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
subtle so it there's just a little bit

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.540 
subtle so it there's just a little bit
of<00:04:02.540> movement<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:02.990> top<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.650> sets

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
of movement to the top and it just sets

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.400 
of movement to the top and it just sets
everything<00:04:04.760> off<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.930> show<00:04:06.080> you<00:04:06.140> here

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
this is our Jesus look that does so in

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.130 
this is our Jesus look that does so in
10<00:04:10.310> 9<00:04:10.460> 8<00:04:10.610> X<00:04:10.790> system<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.300> it's<00:04:11.630> ten<00:04:11.810> percent

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
10 9 8 X system so it's ten percent

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.920 
10 9 8 X system so it's ten percent
carbon<00:04:12.320> ninety<00:04:13.130> percent<00:04:13.250> maple<00:04:13.730> no<00:04:14.360> truss<00:04:14.660> rod

carbon ninety percent maple no truss rod

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.190 
carbon ninety percent maple no truss rod
I<00:04:15.200> know<00:04:15.950> do<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.220> see<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.610> camera

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
I know do you see it on the camera

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.020 
I know do you see it on the camera
but<00:04:18.800> there's<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.190> carbon<00:04:19.520> fiber<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:19.910> goes

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
but there's the carbon fiber it goes

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.150 
but there's the carbon fiber it goes
straight<00:04:20.300> through<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.600> board<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:22.100> you

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
straight through to the board so you

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.370 
straight through to the board so you
never<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.780> never<00:04:23.780> have<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.930> set<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.200> up

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
never have to never have to set it up

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.740 
never have to never have to set it up
good<00:04:25.160> since<00:04:25.430> 1988<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.270> we<00:04:26.360> know<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.600> works

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
good since 1988 so we know it works

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.050 
good since 1988 so we know it works
never<00:04:27.140> been<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.530> enjoy<00:04:27.770> summer<00:04:28.100> warps<00:04:28.460> heat

which<00:05:36.479> we<00:05:36.599> still<00:05:36.779> offer<00:05:36.960> but<00:05:37.349> I<00:05:37.529> like<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.009> one

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
which we still offer but I like this one

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.399 
which we still offer but I like this one
a<00:05:38.189> little<00:05:38.279> better<00:05:38.400> myself<00:05:38.669> beautiful<00:05:39.409> and

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
a little better myself beautiful and

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.529 
a little better myself beautiful and
just<00:05:40.680> like<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:40.919> our<00:05:40.949> Floyd's<00:05:41.539> traditional

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
just like on our Floyd's traditional

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.999 
just like on our Floyd's traditional
trends<00:05:42.870> moving<00:05:43.139> on<00:05:43.229> needle<00:05:43.439> bearings<00:05:43.800> and

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
trends moving on needle bearings and

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.290 
trends moving on needle bearings and
there's<00:05:44.819> so<00:05:45.120> stable<00:05:46.069> so<00:05:47.069> the<00:05:47.639> bridge<00:05:47.849> is<00:05:47.999> more

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
there's so stable so the bridge is more

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.850 
there's so stable so the bridge is more
likely<00:05:48.479> to<00:05:48.629> return<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.020> zero<00:05:49.259> with<00:05:49.620> Neil

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
likely to return to zero with Neil

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.779 
likely to return to zero with Neil

this<00:05:57.599> in<00:05:58.229> my<00:05:58.409> opinion<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:58.949> everybody's<00:05:59.729> goes

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
this in my opinion is everybody's goes

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.450 
this in my opinion is everybody's goes
to<00:06:00.060> Floyd<00:06:00.560> with<00:06:01.560> a<00:06:01.650> lot<00:06:01.800> less<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.159> headaches

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
to Floyd with a lot less the headaches

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.110 
to Floyd with a lot less the headaches
of<00:06:02.639> installing<00:06:03.240> strings<00:06:03.900> on<00:06:04.050> your<00:06:04.080> Floyd<00:06:05.120> but

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
of installing strings on your Floyd but

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.070 
of installing strings on your Floyd but
you<00:06:06.210> know<00:06:06.300> some<00:06:06.449> people<00:06:06.659> just<00:06:06.779> think<00:06:06.930> they

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
you know some people just think they

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.140 
you know some people just think they
need<00:06:07.229> a<00:06:07.259> Floyd<00:06:07.499> so<00:06:07.770> that's<00:06:07.949> that's<00:06:08.909> what<00:06:09.060> they

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
need a Floyd so that's that's what they

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.749 
need a Floyd so that's that's what they
buy<00:06:09.300> that<00:06:09.449> for<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.629> long<00:06:09.749> time<00:06:09.810> sure<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:11.639> this

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
buy that for a long time sure and this

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.249 
buy that for a long time sure and this
year<00:06:11.789> what<00:06:12.270> we<00:06:12.360> also<00:06:12.509> introduced<00:06:12.930> for<00:06:13.139> these

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
year what we also introduced for these

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.679 
year what we also introduced for these
for<00:06:13.830> these<00:06:13.889> trends<00:06:14.339> specifically<00:06:14.909> little

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
for these trends specifically little

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.149 
for these trends specifically little
string<00:06:15.900> dampeners<00:06:16.289> behind<00:06:16.589> the<00:06:16.680> nut<00:06:16.860> so

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
string dampeners behind the nut so

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.519 
string dampeners behind the nut so
sometimes<00:06:17.810> you<00:06:18.810> know<00:06:18.900> your<00:06:19.050> string<00:06:19.229> might<00:06:19.379> get

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
sometimes you know your string might get

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.170 
sometimes you know your string might get
caught<00:06:19.740> in<00:06:20.069> the<00:06:20.099> nut<00:06:20.310> or<00:06:20.460> something<00:06:20.639> when

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
caught in the nut or something when

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.959 
caught in the nut or something when
you're<00:06:21.300> really<00:06:21.539> rockin<00:06:22.050> on<00:06:22.169> the<00:06:22.199> whammy<00:06:22.499> and

you're really rockin on the whammy and

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.820 
you're really rockin on the whammy and
big<00:06:23.969> little<00:06:24.210> ping<00:06:24.419> or<00:06:24.779> some<00:06:25.229> horrible<00:06:25.439> noise

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
big little ping or some horrible noise

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.409 
big little ping or some horrible noise
in<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.099> back<00:06:26.279> so<00:06:26.819> the<00:06:26.909> stringed<00:06:27.120> ammeter

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
in the back so the stringed ammeter

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.389 
in the back so the stringed ammeter
kills<00:06:27.629> all<00:06:27.839> that<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.439> I'm<00:06:28.800> saying<00:06:29.069> a<00:06:29.159> lot<00:06:29.279> of
