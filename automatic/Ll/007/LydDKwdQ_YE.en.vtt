like to slow that down it's just a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
like to slow that down it's just a
matter<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.280> button<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
matter of using the down button and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.590 
matter of using the down button and
lowering<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.890> percentage<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> slower

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
lowering that percentage so the slower

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.859 
lowering that percentage so the slower
we<00:01:18.750> take<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.259> lower<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> down

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
we take it down lower we take it down

we take it down lower we take it down
take<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> 10%<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
take it down to a 10% it's going to just

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
take it down to a 10% it's going to just
going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> change<00:01:24.750> color<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.920> very

then if we press the auto button and we

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.330 
then if we press the auto button and we
can<00:03:10.109> actually<00:03:10.320> speed<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.040> actually

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
can actually speed you can actually

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.759 
can actually speed you can actually
change<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:12.570> if<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.170> liked<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> color

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769

change and then if you liked it to color
scroll<00:03:14.160> nice<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.880> smooth<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:15.989> just<00:03:16.200> slow

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
scroll nice and smooth we can just slow

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.340 
scroll nice and smooth we can just slow
it<00:03:16.590> down<00:03:16.709> there<00:03:17.220> we<00:03:17.430> go

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
it down there we go

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.270 
it down there we go

circuit<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:35.329> also<00:03:36.329> they<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.230> outputs<00:03:37.920> on

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
circuit and also they do have outputs on

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.660 
circuit and also they do have outputs on
them<00:03:38.220> seeking<00:03:38.790> daisy<00:03:39.150> chaining<00:03:40.310> one<00:03:41.310> into<00:03:41.549> the

other into the other into the other very
low<00:03:45.390> wattage<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.019> as<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.799> can<00:03:46.890> see<00:03:47.130> no<00:03:47.940> heat

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
low wattage and as you can see no heat

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.240 
low wattage and as you can see no heat
so<00:03:48.870> no<00:03:48.989> chance<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.500> people<00:03:49.799> burning<00:03:50.130> their

actually<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.140> should<00:03:55.410> say<00:03:55.440> LED<00:03:56.010> life

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
actually I should say LED life

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.500 
actually I should say LED life
average<00:03:57.989> LED<00:03:58.709> life<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.190> about<00:03:59.459> 50,000<00:04:00.209> hours
