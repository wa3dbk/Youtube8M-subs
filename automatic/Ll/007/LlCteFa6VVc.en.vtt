I<00:00:25.960> have<00:00:26.960> bought<00:00:28.090> researched<00:00:29.090> bought<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:29.779> it's

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
I have bought researched bought and it's

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.409 
I have bought researched bought and it's
taken<00:00:30.290> forever<00:00:30.520> literally<00:00:31.520> upgrades<00:00:32.180> for

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
taken forever literally upgrades for

taken forever literally upgrades for
every<00:00:32.840> single<00:00:33.200> component<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:33.860> could

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
every single component you could

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.600 
every single component you could
possibly<00:00:34.550> imagine<00:00:35.860> it's<00:00:36.860> taken<00:00:37.220> a<00:00:37.280> long<00:00:37.580> time

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.750 
possibly imagine it's taken a long time
to<00:00:38.000> get<00:00:38.150> here<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.600> it's<00:00:38.690> cost<00:00:39.230> me<00:00:39.470> an

to get here and it's cost me an

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240 
to get here and it's cost me an
unbelievable<00:00:40.760> amount<00:00:40.970> of<00:00:41.210> money<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.250> I'm

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
part 1 this video we are just gonna sort

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.210 
part 1 this video we are just gonna sort
of<00:00:52.790> go<00:00:53.150> over<00:00:53.480> everything<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.770> gonna<00:00:55.010> make

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
of go over everything that is gonna make

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.479 
of go over everything that is gonna make
up<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:56.030> FF<00:00:56.540> glass<00:00:56.780> g4<00:00:57.230> cube<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:57.920> without

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
up the FF glass g4 cube so without

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.260 
up the FF glass g4 cube so without
further<00:00:58.640> ado<00:00:58.970> let's<00:00:59.810> get<00:00:59.960> going<00:01:00.399> so<00:01:01.399> here<00:01:02.120> is

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
further ado let's get going so here is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.439 
further ado let's get going so here is
the<00:01:02.420> star<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.930> show<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.800> actual

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the star of the show this is the actual

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.140 
the star of the show this is the actual
g4<00:01:05.449> cube<00:01:05.720> itself<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.640> really<00:01:08.030> really

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
g4 cube itself it's in really really

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.630 
g4 cube itself it's in really really
good<00:01:08.270> condition<00:01:08.860> there's<00:01:09.860> no<00:01:09.920> cracks<00:01:10.310> on<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
good condition there's no cracks on the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.950 
good condition there's no cracks on the
sides<00:01:10.850> or<00:01:11.090> anything<00:01:11.240> there's<00:01:11.479> just<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.690> couple

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
sides or anything there's just a couple

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.100 
sides or anything there's just a couple
of<00:01:12.229> little<00:01:12.350> scratches<00:01:13.040> at<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.280> top<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
of little scratches at the top the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
of little scratches at the top the
actual<00:01:15.409> insides<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.640> computer<00:01:16.970> obviously

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
actual insides of the computer obviously

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.030 
actual insides of the computer obviously
this<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> bare-bones<00:01:18.170> system<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.860> there's

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
this is a bare-bones system so there's

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.890 
this is a bare-bones system so there's
only<00:01:19.130> like<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.630> motherboard<00:01:21.049> DVD<00:01:21.770> drive

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
only like the motherboard DVD drive

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.090 
only like the motherboard DVD drive
stuff<00:01:23.900> like<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.650> we're<00:01:24.740> gonna<00:01:24.830> be<00:01:24.920> puttin

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
stuff like that so we're gonna be puttin

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.480 
stuff like that so we're gonna be puttin
all<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.400> our<00:01:25.520> components<00:01:26.090> straight<00:01:26.720> in<00:01:27.490> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
all of our components straight in and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.120 
all of our components straight in and
yeah<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.390> design<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.409> incredible<00:01:31.040> you

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
yeah the design is just incredible you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.399 
yeah the design is just incredible you
can<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:31.490> pick<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.450> whole<00:01:32.630> system<00:01:33.110> out<00:01:33.200> with

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
can just pick the whole system out with

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.950 
can just pick the whole system out with
a<00:01:33.440> handle<00:01:33.860> that's<00:01:34.790> something<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.540> still

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
a handle that's something that still

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.430 
a handle that's something that still
hasn't<00:01:36.229> really<00:01:36.680> been<00:01:37.100> achieved<00:01:37.790> since<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:39.320> now

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
hasn't really been achieved since so now

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.230 
hasn't really been achieved since so now
we've<00:01:39.590> taken<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.920> look<00:01:40.070> at<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.549> actual<00:01:40.820> cube

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
we've taken a look at the actual cube

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.980 
we've taken a look at the actual cube
itself<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.640> bunch<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.850> parts<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.420> what<00:01:44.840> is

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
itself this bunch of parts is what is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050 
itself this bunch of parts is what is
going<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> go<00:01:45.380> inside<00:01:45.680> it<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.790> we're<00:01:46.909> going<00:01:47.000> to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
going to go inside it so we're going to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.179 
going to go inside it so we're going to
go<00:01:47.180> through<00:01:47.510> each<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.590> these<00:01:48.650> sort<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.920> parts

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
go through each of these sort of parts

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.310 
go through each of these sort of parts
one<00:01:49.430> by<00:01:49.580> one<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:49.970> I'm<00:01:50.540> just<00:01:50.570> gonna<00:01:50.780> sort<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.110> go

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
one by one and I'm just gonna sort of go

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.710 
one by one and I'm just gonna sort of go
over<00:01:51.710> what<00:01:52.189> they're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.299> be<00:01:53.390> used<00:01:53.600> for

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
over what they're going to be used for

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.500 
over what they're going to be used for
so<00:01:54.530> arguably<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.340> least<00:01:55.580> exciting<00:01:56.180> part<00:01:56.420> of

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
so arguably the least exciting part of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.289 
so arguably the least exciting part of
all<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.780> these<00:01:56.900> is<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.520> 802<00:01:59.119> 11

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
all of these is this this is the 802 11

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.980 
all of these is this this is the 802 11
original<00:02:00.640> Apple<00:02:01.640> airport<00:02:02.090> cards<00:02:02.450> now

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
original Apple airport cards now

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.620 
original Apple airport cards now
obviously<00:02:03.650> there's<00:02:03.860> only<00:02:03.979> supports<00:02:04.369> up<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.759> 11

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
obviously there's only supports up to 11

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.630 
obviously there's only supports up to 11
there<00:02:05.750> per<00:02:06.020> second<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.430> I'm<00:02:07.520> going

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
there per second but for what I'm going

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.309 
there per second but for what I'm going
to<00:02:07.700> use<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:07.970> cube<00:02:08.269> for<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.539> would<00:02:08.750> rather<00:02:08.959> use

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
to use this cube for I would rather use

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.209 
to use this cube for I would rather use
the<00:02:09.549> built<00:02:10.549> in<00:02:11.499> airport<00:02:12.499> card<00:02:12.709> as<00:02:12.799> opposed<00:02:13.099> to

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
the built in airport card as opposed to

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.039 
the built in airport card as opposed to
gain<00:02:13.400> like<00:02:13.579> a<00:02:13.609> USB<00:02:13.909> one<00:02:14.209> or<00:02:14.329> whatever<00:02:14.659> because

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
gain like a USB one or whatever because

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.440 
gain like a USB one or whatever because
as<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.620> know<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.859> USB

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
as you know the USB

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.600 
as you know the USB
ports<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.069> cubes<00:02:18.310> there's<00:02:18.520> only

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
ports on the on the cubes there's only

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.589 
ports on the on the cubes there's only
two<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:19.000> them<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.390> I'd<00:02:19.569> rather<00:02:21.330> go<00:02:22.330> for<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
two of them so I'd rather go for this

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.050 
two of them so I'd rather go for this
and<00:02:22.840> save<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.050> USB<00:02:23.530> port<00:02:23.709> basically<00:02:24.129> next<00:02:24.879> step

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and save a USB port basically next step

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.619 
and save a USB port basically next step
we<00:02:25.540> have<00:02:25.690> two<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.170> these<00:02:26.379> these<00:02:26.769> are<00:02:27.629> single

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
we have two of these these are single

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.369 
we have two of these these are single
molex<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.849> molex<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.120> three<00:02:31.810> pin<00:02:32.080> fan

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
molex to molex and three pin fan

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.140 
molex to molex and three pin fan
connector<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.760> see<00:02:33.819> there

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
connector now as you can see there

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.390 
connector now as you can see there
there's<00:02:34.300> two<00:02:34.480> fans<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.769> still<00:02:36.220> want<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
there's two fans here I still want to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.710 
there's two fans here I still want to
use<00:02:36.459> DVD<00:02:36.940> drive<00:02:37.180> from<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.390> hard<00:02:37.599> drive

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
use DVD drive from the hard drive

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.720 
use DVD drive from the hard drive
obviously<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.890> yeah<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.239> way<00:02:41.019> of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
obviously so yeah this is just a way of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.850 
obviously so yeah this is just a way of
being<00:02:42.730> able<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.780> fans<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> system

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
being able to get fans in the system

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.400 
being able to get fans in the system
speaking<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.849> fans<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> them

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
speaking of fans this is one of them

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.110 
speaking of fans this is one of them
this<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.830> main<00:02:48.040> base<00:02:48.430> family<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:48.970> gonna

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
this is the main base family is gonna

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.470 
this is the main base family is gonna
say<00:02:49.330> at<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> bottom<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.110> system<00:02:51.480> these

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
say at the bottom of the system these

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.089 
say at the bottom of the system these
are<00:02:52.660> decent<00:02:52.900> reviews<00:02:53.380> as<00:02:53.560> sort<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
are decent reviews as sort of like a

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.640 
are decent reviews as sort of like a
case<00:02:54.370> fan<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.849> normal<00:02:55.060> PCs<00:02:55.420> I've<00:02:55.989> tested<00:02:56.590> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
case fan and normal PCs I've tested it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.610 
case fan and normal PCs I've tested it
out<00:02:56.799> inside<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.360> main<00:02:58.569> rig<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.140> it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
out inside the the main rig and it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.350 
out inside the the main rig and it's
quiet<00:03:00.130> enough<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.760> should<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.000> sort<00:03:01.269> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
quiet enough and it should just sort of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.940 
quiet enough and it should just sort of
help<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.220> airflow<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.700> CPU<00:03:04.799> blow<00:03:05.799> out

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
help the airflow in the CPU blow out

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.100 
help the airflow in the CPU blow out
more<00:03:06.340> air<00:03:06.489> out<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> top<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.450> system<00:03:07.840> so

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
more air out to the top of the system so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.130 
more air out to the top of the system so
yeah<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> main<00:03:09.670> base<00:03:10.030> fan<00:03:10.299> now<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:11.019> you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
yeah that's the main base fan now if you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.589 
yeah that's the main base fan now if you
own<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.380> cube<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:12.880> an<00:03:13.000> upgraded<00:03:13.329> graphics

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
own a cube with an upgraded graphics

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.539 
own a cube with an upgraded graphics
card<00:03:14.019> there's<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.290> very<00:03:14.590> high<00:03:14.920> chance<00:03:14.950> you're

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
card there's a very high chance you're

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.930 
card there's a very high chance you're
running<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.120> these<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.040> now<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.730> cost

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
running one of these in it now this cost

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.050 
running one of these in it now this cost
a<00:03:19.090> bomb<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.019> imported<00:03:20.349> from<00:03:20.799> America<00:03:21.130> home

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
a bomb to get imported from America home

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.000 
a bomb to get imported from America home
it's<00:03:22.600> unbelievable<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.260> much<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.560> little

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
it's unbelievable how much this little

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.670 
it's unbelievable how much this little
thing<00:03:24.160> cost<00:03:24.370> me<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:25.269> basically<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.470> can<00:03:26.500> see

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
thing cost me but basically you can see

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.840 
thing cost me but basically you can see
the<00:03:26.769> graphics<00:03:27.130> card<00:03:27.310> there<00:03:27.489> I'm<00:03:27.549> going<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.700> go

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the graphics card there I'm going to go

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.729 
the graphics card there I'm going to go
on<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.359> minute<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.530> little

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
on to that in a minute but this little

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.360 
on to that in a minute but this little
guy<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.790> Titan<00:03:31.380> cooler<00:03:32.380> currently<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
guy it's a Titan cooler currently the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.879 
guy it's a Titan cooler currently the
exact<00:03:33.730> model<00:03:33.910> but<00:03:34.440> basically<00:03:35.440> every<00:03:35.859> single

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
exact model but basically every single

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.440 
exact model but basically every single
this<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.850> infamous<00:03:37.269> for<00:03:37.630> being<00:03:37.660> perfect<00:03:38.590> for

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
this it's infamous for being perfect for

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.629 
this it's infamous for being perfect for
cooling<00:03:40.450> higher-end<00:03:41.019> GPUs<00:03:41.560> inside<00:03:41.920> cube<00:03:42.250> so

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
cooling higher-end GPUs inside cube so

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.199 
cooling higher-end GPUs inside cube so
yeah<00:03:43.209> that's<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.260> GPU<00:03:44.620> cooler<00:03:44.950> here<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.790> GPU

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
yeah that's a GPU cooler here is the GPU

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.610 
yeah that's a GPU cooler here is the GPU
itself<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.560> an<00:03:47.769> NVIDIA<00:03:48.280> GeForce<00:03:49.620> 6200

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
itself this is an NVIDIA GeForce 6200

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.759 
itself this is an NVIDIA GeForce 6200
this<00:03:50.739> year<00:03:50.920> this<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.269> made<00:03:52.269> by<00:03:52.299> XFX<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.500> believe

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
this year this is made by XFX I believe

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.770 
this year this is made by XFX I believe
it's<00:03:54.609> got<00:03:54.670> 256<00:03:55.600> Meg's<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.989> ddr2<00:03:56.470> video<00:03:57.459> memory

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
it's got 256 Meg's of ddr2 video memory

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.270 
it's got 256 Meg's of ddr2 video memory
and<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.079> most<00:03:59.260> important<00:03:59.709> thing<00:03:59.769> it<00:03:59.920> supports

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
and the most important thing it supports

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.190 
and the most important thing it supports
core<00:04:00.609> image<00:04:00.880> course<00:04:01.239> extreme<00:04:01.660> all<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.049> that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
core image course extreme all of that

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.190 
core image course extreme all of that
goodness<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:04.329> really<00:04:04.750> should<00:04:05.049> make

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
goodness so this really should make

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.789 
goodness so this really should make
running<00:04:05.440> leopard<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.450> cube<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.959> much<00:04:08.410> more

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
running leopard on this cube a much more

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.920 
running leopard on this cube a much more
pleasurable<00:04:09.190> experience<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.690> RAM

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
pleasurable experience this is the RAM

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.780 
pleasurable experience this is the RAM
so<00:04:11.620> I've<00:04:11.709> got<00:04:11.859> three<00:04:12.160> sticks<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.900> 512<00:04:13.900> Meg's<00:04:14.790> PC

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
so I've got three sticks of 512 Meg's PC

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.599 
so I've got three sticks of 512 Meg's PC
133<00:04:16.690> memory<00:04:17.079> it's<00:04:17.709> standard<00:04:18.070> stuff<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.430> can

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
133 memory it's standard stuff you can

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.430 
133 memory it's standard stuff you can
really<00:04:18.760> do<00:04:18.940> much<00:04:19.120> more<00:04:19.329> with<00:04:19.539> them<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.229> terms

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
really do much more with them in terms

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.960 
really do much more with them in terms
of<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.859> terms<00:04:20.889> of<00:04:21.250> around<00:04:21.430> when<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.669> comes<00:04:21.700> to

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
cubes 1.5 gigs for leopard is is plenty

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.680 
cubes 1.5 gigs for leopard is is plenty
enough<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:26.099> yeah<00:04:27.099> pretty<00:04:27.729> simple<00:04:28.150> stuff<00:04:28.360> in

I'm<00:04:30.250> gonna<00:04:30.430> be<00:04:30.580> running<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.540> guy<00:04:32.110> now<00:04:32.590> with

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
I'm gonna be running this guy now with

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.470 
I'm gonna be running this guy now with
this<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.370> probably<00:04:33.670> where<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:33.850> spend<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.240> most

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
this is probably where I spend the most

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.180 
this is probably where I spend the most
time<00:04:34.720> sort<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.200> mulling<00:04:35.620> over<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.920> my<00:04:36.010> head

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
time sort of mulling over in my head

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.520 
time sort of mulling over in my head
what<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.520> want<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.850> run<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.270> could<00:04:38.230> have<00:04:38.380> gone

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
what I want to run I could have gone

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.600 
what I want to run I could have gone
with<00:04:38.650> an<00:04:38.770> SSD<00:04:39.100> but<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:41.040> basically<00:04:42.040> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
with an SSD but the basically the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.150 
with an SSD but the basically the
conclusion<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.360> came<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.630> was<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:45.640> ATA<00:04:46.000> bus<00:04:46.360> on

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
conclusion I came to was the ATA bus on

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.250 
conclusion I came to was the ATA bus on
on<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.340> g4<00:04:48.700> cube<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.060> even<00:04:49.720> slower<00:04:50.020> than<00:04:50.140> what

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
on the g4 cube is even slower than what

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.080 
on the g4 cube is even slower than what
was<00:04:50.470> in<00:04:50.500> my<00:04:50.650> power<00:04:50.830> book<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.280> put<00:04:51.460> an<00:04:51.550> SSD<00:04:51.820> in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
was in my power book and I put an SSD in

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.720 
was in my power book and I put an SSD in
that<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:53.770> really<00:04:54.220> couldn't<00:04:54.430> really

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
that and I just really couldn't really

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.010 
that and I just really couldn't really
justify<00:04:56.040> spending<00:04:57.120> upwards<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.420> 50<00:04:58.810> quid<00:04:58.990> on
