to the side going to take a diagonal

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.840 
to the side going to take a diagonal
piece<00:00:22.850> split<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> into<00:00:24.150> three

up a section on each side and continue

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:48.450 
up a section on each side and continue
along<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:42.530> one<00:00:43.090> comb<00:00:44.090> it<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:46.600> continue<00:00:47.600> I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
along that one comb it in and continue I

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.720 
along that one comb it in and continue I
like<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.610> usually<00:00:49.820> work<00:00:50.270> on<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.750> diagonal<00:00:51.730> so

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
like to usually work on to a diagonal so

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.670 
like to usually work on to a diagonal so
that<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.059> fits<00:00:53.420> into<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.900> head<00:00:54.200> with<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
that it fits into the head with the

that it fits into the head with the
shape<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.430> curve<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:57.860> keep<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.220> nice

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
shape and the curve and to keep it nice

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.540 
shape and the curve and to keep it nice
and<00:00:58.580> tight<00:00:58.879> as<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.590> move<00:01:00.590> along<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:01.190> will<00:01:01.430> be

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and tight as we move along we will be

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.450 
and tight as we move along we will be
loosening<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.269> up<00:01:02.330> in<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.780> little<00:01:03.080> bit<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:04.309> we

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
don't want to go too terribly tight with

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.280 
don't want to go too terribly tight with
it<00:01:06.729> make<00:01:07.729> sure<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:08.120> get<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.330> cleaned<00:01:08.870> out<00:01:09.140> and
