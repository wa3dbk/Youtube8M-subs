 lost had to close the lid 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.180
 but added such a thermostat 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 here's a setup for thirty seven and seven 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:46.010
 I have it here with us volts 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:58.710
 fan adapter 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:04.970
 here's a version so here I built it there 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 all wiring any 12-volt 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 cruelty so here are the thermometers 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.840
 electronic most interesting is that everyone 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.869
 thermometer shows its temperature to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.940
 Sep 30 8 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:37.259
 this view 7 and 6 shows 38 one this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:44.789
 shows itself difficult 70 percent and 7 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:47.399
 and 3 address me 37 637 messi is obtained 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.049
 I set two degrees to not 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 often included a shot at 2 degrees 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.649
 this i will turn off before turning for now and to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649
 know exactly 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.100
 our cool look 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:30.709
 quench at 8 turns out the temperature 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:40.849
 principle can be removed to clarify on 0 1 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:46.209
 degree of weight go go push the button does not 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.209
 on 4 we make movies 3 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.110
 will turn out 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:04:01.030
 7 9 and I try trypsin 370 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:05.480
 now let's reset the thermometer and 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.900
 again and put see what we have of 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.900
 this will come out 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:24.010
 6603 by those 6 but now he must turn 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.010
 how will 375 turn on 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.880
 included third 5 times 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:37.090
 in 0 2 degrees set otherwise he 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.090
 it turns out very often 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:51.539
 very often begins to flash and this too 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:05:02.809
 not very good so what else two 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:05:02.809
 the fan stand it about at the height 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:12.979
 joy didn't just add two light bulbs 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:12.979
