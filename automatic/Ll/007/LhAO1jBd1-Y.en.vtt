00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.880 

just<00:01:43.950> pick<00:01:44.159> Disney

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.080 

it's<00:01:50.890> going<00:01:51.039> to<00:01:51.070> render<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.609> I<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.850> go<00:01:51.939> y

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
it's going to render it and I can go y

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.240 
it's going to render it and I can go y
is<00:01:52.149> greater<00:01:52.329> yeah<00:01:52.810> in<00:01:53.560> fact<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.859> think<00:01:53.920> that's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
is greater yeah in fact I think that's

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.940 
is greater yeah in fact I think that's
the<00:01:54.399> only<00:01:54.429> okay<00:01:55.240> does<00:01:56.049> it<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.350> any<00:01:56.530> seller<00:01:56.799> in

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the only okay does it have any seller in

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.919 
the only okay does it have any seller in
meters<00:01:57.219> so<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.520> figures<00:01:58.030> out<00:01:58.360> when<00:01:58.780> you're

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
meters so it figures out when you're

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.309 
meters so it figures out when you're
recording<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.500> yeah<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.860> does<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.200> most

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
recording it yeah it does and in most

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.959 
recording it yeah it does and in most
applications<00:02:02.500> like<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.280> web<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:03.700> surveying

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
applications like the web and surveying

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.789 
applications like the web and surveying
photos<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.990> know<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:05.289> going<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.709> be

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
photos you know it's going to be

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.800 
photos you know it's going to be
contextual<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.640> same<00:02:06.819> thing<00:02:06.969> with<00:02:07.119> with<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
contextual the same thing with with the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
contextual the same thing with with the
TV<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.590> think<00:02:08.769> with<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> TV<00:02:09.099> it's<00:02:09.310> always<00:02:09.549> white

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
TV I think with the TV it's always white

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.610 
TV I think with the TV it's always white
screen<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.269> don't<00:02:10.780> think<00:02:10.840> there's<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> ability

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
screen I don't think there's the ability

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.690 
screen I don't think there's the ability
to<00:02:11.739> actually<00:02:11.890> change<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:15.129> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.400> cool<00:02:15.549> thing

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
to actually change so in the cool thing

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.949 
to actually change so in the cool thing
again<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.330> know<00:02:16.420> these<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.599> all<00:02:16.780> live

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
again you know these are all live

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.589 
again you know these are all live
applications<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.819> actually<00:02:18.970> went<00:02:19.239> back<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
applications this actually went back it

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.940 
applications this actually went back it
may<00:02:19.720> extend<00:02:20.079> this<00:02:20.230> would<00:02:20.380> go<00:02:20.470> back<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.709> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
may extend this would go back to the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.009 
may extend this would go back to the
viewer<00:02:21.190> i<00:02:21.790> think<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:22.510> i<00:02:22.569> can<00:02:22.720> get<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.900> another

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
viewer i think if i can get you another

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.050 
viewer i think if i can get you another
application<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:24.250> i<00:02:24.280> talked<00:02:24.459> about<00:02:24.549> pandora

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
application so i talked about pandora

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.460 
application so i talked about pandora
can<00:02:25.510> we<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.660> don't<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.049> might<00:02:26.140> not<00:02:26.290> know<00:02:26.440> this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
can we I don't you might not know this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.400 
can we I don't you might not know this

and I saw that you know it went back to
the<00:02:32.980> card<00:02:33.190> mode<00:02:33.430> will<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.569> keep<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.530> i

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the card mode will it keep like if i

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.490 
the card mode will it keep like if i
switch<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.010> say<00:02:36.760> send<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> text<00:02:37.660> message<00:02:37.720> will

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.190 
and then if you if you do that again can
you<00:03:37.439> maximize<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.489> yeah<00:03:39.239> actually<00:03:39.870> launched

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you maximize that yeah actually launched

you maximize that yeah actually launched
yeah<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.799> can<00:03:40.920> actually<00:03:41.069> launch<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.609> app<00:03:42.769> so

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
yeah you can actually launch the app so

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.720 
yeah you can actually launch the app so
it's<00:03:43.920> running<00:03:44.129> in<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.250> background<00:03:44.370> it's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
it's running in the background it's

I've launched the fro we had a full app
and<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> app<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.790> really<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.420> don't<00:03:52.139> know<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.349> it

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
and the app is really I don't know if it

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.619 
and the app is really I don't know if it
gives<00:03:52.500> her<00:03:52.620> Pandora<00:03:52.980> fans<00:03:53.250> my<00:03:54.120> favorite<00:03:54.450> half

gives her Pandora fans my favorite half

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.369 
gives her Pandora fans my favorite half
of<00:03:54.780> all<00:03:54.900> times<00:03:55.340> ya<00:03:56.340> know<00:03:56.519> it's<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.700> cool<00:03:56.879> service

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
of all times ya know it's a cool service

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.839 
of all times ya know it's a cool service
so<00:03:58.379> really<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.769> compelling<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.340> means<00:03:59.459> visually

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
so really a compelling it means visually

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.270 
so really a compelling it means visually
quite<00:04:00.269> nice<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.750> works<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.139> get<00:04:01.889> North<00:04:02.189> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
quite nice and works like get North the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.500 
quite nice and works like get North the
desktop<00:04:02.639> or<00:04:02.879> anywhere<00:04:03.120> else<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:05.359> couple<00:04:06.359> of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
desktop or anywhere else so a couple of

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.599 
desktop or anywhere else so a couple of
their<00:04:06.659> apps<00:04:06.810> oh<00:04:07.139> yeah<00:04:07.709> how<00:04:08.040> many<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.400> these

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
their apps oh yeah how many of these

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.369 
their apps oh yeah how many of these
gods<00:04:08.909> when<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.389> up<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.719> the<00:04:09.810> ocean<00:04:09.989> you

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
gods when you have up in the ocean you

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.020 
gods when you have up in the ocean you
know<00:04:10.439> it's<00:04:10.560> kind<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.739> dependence<00:04:11.189> you<00:04:11.849> know<00:04:11.939> if

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
know it's kind of dependence you know if

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.149 
know it's kind of dependence you know if
you<00:04:12.150> really<00:04:12.299> have<00:04:12.900> real<00:04:13.139> data<00:04:13.409> intensive<00:04:13.739> it's

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
you really have real data intensive it's

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.920 
you really have real data intensive it's
going<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.700> slow<00:04:15.090> down<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.269> little<00:04:15.450> bit<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.900> know

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
going to slow down a little bit you know

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.420 
going to slow down a little bit you know
we<00:04:16.079> have<00:04:16.199> people<00:04:16.639> run<00:04:17.639> 10<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.060> 15<00:04:18.509> apps<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:20.070> I

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
we have people run 10 to 15 apps so I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.039 
we have people run 10 to 15 apps so I
think<00:04:20.579> it's<00:04:20.729> all<00:04:20.849> dependents<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.840> don't

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
think it's all dependents and you don't

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.020 
think it's all dependents and you don't
think<00:04:22.109> we've<00:04:22.259> really<00:04:22.289> tested<00:04:23.009> or<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.910> it's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
think we've really tested or but it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.210 
think we've really tested or but it's
like<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.419> theoretically<00:04:25.110> unlimited<00:04:25.289> yeah

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
like it's theoretically unlimited yeah

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.469 
like it's theoretically unlimited yeah
but<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:26.580> just<00:04:26.729> yeah<00:04:26.849> there's<00:04:27.030> no<00:04:27.120> limits

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
but it's just yeah there's no limits

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.540 
but it's just yeah there's no limits
neither<00:04:28.380> polymer<00:04:28.740> sprint<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.159> put<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.340> limit

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
neither polymer sprint just put a limit

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.219 
neither polymer sprint just put a limit
to<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.880> number<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.870> you'll<00:04:30.960> be<00:04:31.020> kind<00:04:31.110> of

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
to the number so you'll be kind of

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.200 
to the number so you'll be kind of
constrained<00:04:31.590> by<00:04:31.849> processing<00:04:32.849> coloring<00:04:33.180> right

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
constrained by processing coloring right

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.490 
constrained by processing coloring right
so<00:04:34.849> flight<00:04:35.849> lieut<00:04:36.030> flight<00:04:36.449> view<00:04:36.690> or<00:04:36.930> Fandango

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
so flight lieut flight view or Fandango

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.589 
so flight lieut flight view or Fandango
Fandango<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.039> often<00:04:38.280> people<00:04:38.400> or<00:04:38.580> no<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:39.449> it's

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
Fandango and often people or no the it's

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.850 
Fandango and often people or no the it's
kind<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.900> movie<00:04:40.169> application<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.710> that's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
kind of a movie application so that's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.550 
kind of a movie application so that's
done<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.099> music's<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.610> plan<00:04:44.849> yeah<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:46.500> you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
done the music's the plan yeah can you

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.140 
done the music's the plan yeah can you
hear<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.889> you're<00:04:47.130> gonna<00:04:47.220> do<00:04:47.430> sir

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.000 

so<00:04:53.050> what<00:04:53.200> I've<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.290> done<00:04:53.530> is<00:04:53.680> launched

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
so what I've just done is launched

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.980 
so what I've just done is launched
Fandango<00:04:54.610> while<00:04:55.120> applications<00:04:55.750> are<00:04:55.900> running

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
Fandango while applications are running

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.990 
Fandango while applications are running
in<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.230> background<00:04:56.320> as<00:04:56.680> well<00:04:56.710> too<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.460> I'll

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
in the background as well too so I'll

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.420 
in the background as well too so I'll
just<00:04:58.060> go<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.420> let's<00:04:59.260> go<00:04:59.350> too<00:04:59.410> fast<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.770> furious

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.710 

so<00:05:03.430> from<00:05:03.610> an<00:05:03.760> African<00:05:03.880> application

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
so from an African application

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.120 
so from an African application
perspective<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.500> know<00:05:05.530> it's<00:05:05.740> bringing<00:05:06.010> up

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
perspective you know it's bringing up

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.250 
perspective you know it's bringing up
ratings<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.450> could<00:05:07.600> go<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.020> trailer

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
ratings and I could go to the trailer

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.130 
ratings and I could go to the trailer
and<00:05:08.770> see<00:05:08.920> what<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.130> trailer<00:05:09.430> does<00:05:09.990> good<00:05:10.990> movie

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.720 

the<00:05:17.140> screen<00:05:17.470> assumes<00:05:17.860> sometimes<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.580> go<00:05:18.670> to

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
the screen assumes sometimes you go to

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.790 
the screen assumes sometimes you go to
happen<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.180> few<00:05:19.210> times<00:05:19.380> register<00:05:20.380> yeah<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.590> think

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
happen a few times register yeah I think

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.070 
happen a few times register yeah I think
it's<00:05:20.890> more<00:05:20.980> me<00:05:21.460> than<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:22.060> screen<00:05:22.390> itself<00:05:22.540> and

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
it's more me than the screen itself and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.560 
it's more me than the screen itself and
it's<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.980> little<00:05:24.460> bit<00:05:24.580> new<00:05:24.730> to<00:05:24.760> navigating<00:05:25.240> so

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
it's a little bit new to navigating so

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.390 
it's a little bit new to navigating so
some<00:05:26.410> of<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.530> applications<00:05:26.650> it's<00:05:27.160> a<00:05:27.220> little

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
some of the applications it's a little

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.080 
some of the applications it's a little
bit<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.580> hold<00:05:27.790> touching<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.420> hold<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.970> we'll

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
bit of a hold touching a hold so we'll

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.430 
bit of a hold touching a hold so we'll
see<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.300> on<00:05:34.390> if<00:05:34.510> there's<00:05:34.660> even<00:05:34.750> camped<00:05:35.170> in<00:05:35.260> here

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
see it on if there's even camped in here

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.290 
see it on if there's even camped in here
and<00:05:35.620> looks<00:05:36.370> like<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:36.670> going<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.850> shut<00:05:37.270> down

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
and looks like it's going to shut down

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.600 
and looks like it's going to shut down
the<00:05:37.660> it's<00:05:38.380> going<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.560> default<00:05:38.710> back<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.460> the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
the it's going to default back to the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.070 
the it's going to default back to the
primary<00:05:40.030> application<00:05:40.390> from<00:05:40.690> an<00:05:40.810> audio

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
primary application from an audio

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.470 
primary application from an audio
perspective<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:43.320> great<00:05:44.320> sense<00:05:44.590> of<00:05:44.860> audio<00:05:45.480> like

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
perspective a great sense of audio like

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.320 
perspective a great sense of audio like
this<00:05:46.570> week<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.840> listen<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.170> Vin<00:05:47.290> Diesel<00:05:47.650> now

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.130 

know<00:05:52.330> what's<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.570> software<00:05:52.900> that's<00:05:53.050> running

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
know what's the software that's running

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.260 
know what's the software that's running
the<00:05:53.500> songs<00:05:53.740> you<00:05:53.890> know<00:05:54.010> it's<00:05:54.460> not<00:05:54.640> great<00:05:54.880> time<00:05:55.090> I

imagine<00:05:55.690> we<00:05:56.620> know<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> think<00:05:57.040> this<00:05:57.100> is<00:05:57.160> probably

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
imagine we know I think this is probably

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.310 
imagine we know I think this is probably
web-based<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:58.150> this<00:05:58.300> is<00:05:58.420> probably<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.690> web<00:05:58.840> app

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
web-based so this is probably a web app

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.470 
web-based so this is probably a web app
yeah<00:06:00.890> on<00:06:01.220> this<00:06:01.370> particular<00:06:01.550> application<00:06:02.420> I

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
yeah on this particular application I

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.280 
yeah on this particular application I
mean<00:06:02.570> that's<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:02.780> other<00:06:02.840> thing<00:06:02.930> from<00:06:03.170> a

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
mean that's the other thing from a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.640 
mean that's the other thing from a
third-party<00:06:03.620> perspective<00:06:05.230> webos<00:06:06.230> is<00:06:06.440> really

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
third-party perspective webos is really

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.890 
third-party perspective webos is really
built<00:06:06.830> on<00:06:06.980> web<00:06:07.160> technologies<00:06:07.820> so<00:06:08.390> if<00:06:08.540> you're

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
I don't think polym is officially

I don't think polym is officially
announcing<00:06:23.240> anything<00:06:23.390> but<00:06:23.600> there's<00:06:23.780> an

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
announcing anything but there's an

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.550 
announcing anything but there's an
alliance<00:06:24.200> of<00:06:24.620> flash<00:06:24.830> alliance<00:06:25.280> in<00:06:25.400> fact<00:06:25.640> at

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
alliance of flash alliance in fact at

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.290 
alliance of flash alliance in fact at
Mobile<00:06:27.560> World<00:06:27.590> Congress<00:06:28.040> they<00:06:28.790> announced<00:06:29.180> an

Mobile World Congress they announced an
alliance<00:06:29.540> of<00:06:29.840> them<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:30.230> i<00:06:30.290> think<00:06:30.380> that's
