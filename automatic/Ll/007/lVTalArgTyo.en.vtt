00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello all yourself hunter and in this video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 I will tell about sets with sensors from legs 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.840
 real control 2 show how kravets how 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 work so let's start 1 sensor it sets with 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.750
 remote sensor to make it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.720
 you need a digital frequency thermometer 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.699
 bind il yellow dye and paper 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
 after you scrubbed it 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.439
 need to right click with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.520
 him in the hands of the album nuclear reactor 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.190
 like this 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.230
 and you get here forge a card here 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.420
 written coordinates of the nuclear 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 reactor now it needs to be placed 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
 or 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.010
 remote temperature sensor from there 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.640
 to see the data either put in 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.170
 information panel and here we see it 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.330
 data so the next sensor is already 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.020
 called a set for energy 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.660
 storage facilities 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 it becomes as follows red 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 dust frequency bind il paper and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.100
 red dye further take a lesson and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.320
 click on any and nerves store 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 get a horseshoe from a card he 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.800
 records data of this block 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.040
 where there is energy chronic and so put in 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.399
 information panel and see 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.860
 energy is freely stored and filled 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.860
 And if I destroyed the storage and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.319
 put it in place any other 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:34.410
 for example, we will see the following 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.300
 energy is freely stored and filled then 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.729
 have it tied to energy 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.679
 storage to block if in this block 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.490
 there is any energy storage then 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.800
 this will display it like this 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.690
 following us already set for liquid 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.490
 storage facilities 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.790
 in order to make it necessary 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.130
 Bucket frequency bind il lapis lazuli and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 paper 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.940
 so for example, I have stored 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 right-clicking water tank 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 mouse open the dashboard and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.610
 we put here and see the name water yes y 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.100
 I have water there 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.400
 the amount of free capacity and how much 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.740
 filled and if I destroyed here 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.520
 cube cisterns and for example them again 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:28.200
 I will put that given will be updated so here 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.390
 like standing so we can see the name of the district and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 because there is no liquid 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.550
 that's why he writes something he doesn't know 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.620
 We can pour a bucket of lava such as 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:49.860
 we see the words let's fill we see 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.780
 free but the number 16 is full on 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.989
 100 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:59.220
 So we withdraw the next sensor is a set 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.770
 for the generator we need any 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.940
 generator so this one i use not 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.340
 I'll be here until we take the most 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.340
 the simplest most primitive generator of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:18.360
 industrial craft 2 experiments here it is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.100
 We put it like court further write down 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.590
 and this one with this sensor 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:29.120
 to make it necessary to receive 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.810
 frequency guardian nerves bind or 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.010
 light gray dyes and paper 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.180
 light gray dye can be obtained 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.920
 claim of bone meal and ink bear so 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 right click and we 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.160
 recorded his coordinates put here and we 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.310
 see this generator now 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.739
 produce 0 energy at what he can 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.810
 be up and running but there will be constantly to 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.360
 foot makeup 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.790
 there is a belt from their numbers only in that case 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.930
 when we have energy will go by 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.989
 wires that is when he 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.239
 energy will give up let's take 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:13.890
 for example any boards or wood and 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:17.190
 let down the court and we see a way out 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.040
 9 because of the tag meaning this generator 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.440
 generates 9 unity ktr energy for 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.940
 teak 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.229
 although it shows 10 types 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.070
 but who believe then you have to decide in food 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.510
 previous versions of legs real control 2 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.880
 what happened here, these values are 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.000
 turned off that is, there was a reef 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.650
 energy or even what any other 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.620
 so install it last 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.350
 version version name will be in the description 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.200
 to this video as download will also be 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.580
 also therefore download put then 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.600
 you will be displayed correctly on 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.510
 monitor value and units 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.060
 so told about this sensor told 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.950
 I will talk about this set in 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.410
 next video because to him still 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.470
 there is one mechanism and still want to tell 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.340
 about two cards 1 this card with time 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.930
 so I need to make a watch 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.930
 insulated tin wire and paper 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.610
 we put here and we see the time 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.610
 This time is displayed in the game world. 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.720
 The following we have a text card 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.169
 to make bypass wiring diagrams 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.479
 insulated tin wire and paper 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.580
 so put here and we see appeared 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.970
 vodka here we press a button and here we are 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.020
 we can type any text 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.180
 for example, so in length here in my 32 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.470
 maximum or less symbols are not exactly 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.020
 I know I did not count down ten lines here 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.930
 we see just the letter h 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.169
 the more lines the more 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.330
 more precisely the smaller year font so let's 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.820
 let's erase unfortunately labor here wash 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.970
 so first think what to write 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.790
 for the same write so let's for example 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:25.730
 just the letter and we see what it became 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:25.730
 so let's write for example hunter 44 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.860
 Here we see if I suddenly take it right now 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.340
 I will write a couple of lines for example here deuce 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.330
 here are the three 4 5 6 7 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:43.190
 ok we saw that is all 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.590
 displaying the value they have decreased 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.900
 so what do you think 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.260
 likes subscribe to my channel and up 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.260
 see you soon
