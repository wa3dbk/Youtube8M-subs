00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.140
 I want to show us how you can 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.390
 register this look for the holidays 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.970
 comes in the seasons that are already 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.400
 here that is Christmas new year because the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.230
 bids I found very versatile for all 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.760
 these dates for both Christmas and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.359
 for new year both by day and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.359
 for the night 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 hello welcome once again to fashion 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 one and today I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 makeup that I wear since the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.110
 truth is that I find it very versatile 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 for all these dates for both 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 Christmas as for New Year both for the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 day as for the night the truth is that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 to me I was delighted and I hope 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 you like it too and if you do 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.269
 You can send me for a fort with the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.339
 hashtag salt and christmas to my networks 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.800
 social that I leave here and good 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.390
 let's lose with the video starts 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
 giving me a first in the whole eyelid 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 so that the shadows are well fixed and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 I start with a light beige shade in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.280
 all the eyelid also under the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.280
 eyebrow and even a little bit in the eye 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 and now I start with the first shadow 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.400
 golden I put it on the whole eyelid with 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.400
 that brochita keeps as you see 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.110
 and also making a little corner and now 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 this golden shade stronger I 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.250
 to put alone at the end of the eye and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.290
 also doing the little tail that I've done 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.610
 already with the other shadow and blew it 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.610
 clear with the previous 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.260
 I think of this makeup too 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.660
 you can take the technique let's say and you can 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.520
 change the colors if you are not convinced 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.530
 this you can combine a lot of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 colors such as black and gold 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.860
 or red and white those that you like the most 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 now with that straight brush and that shadow 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.720
 which is like coffee with golden sparkles 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.240
 What I'm going to do is make myself a little bit 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.490
 let's say and mark me more what is the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.470
 makeup I'm going to put it under 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.990
 the lower lashes and following the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.750
 angle of the lower eyelid I'm going to 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.000
 throw it up is to say follow the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.190
 angle of your own eye because that's how 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 it's how it's going to look better and as you can see 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.930
 framework and now I do as a kind of 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.760
 There it is and this makes them look like 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.010
 eyes so bigger because I'm like 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.570
 the eye socket above and now with 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.850
 that redondito brush and the same shadow 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.500
 What I'm going to do is give it more color and 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.960
 blur it with the golden shadows 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.030
 previous only by the end as 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.010
 you are watching there and that everything is integrated 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.010
 well so that it is degraded 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050
 I believe that this combination the truth 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.000
 is that I find it super pretty with a 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.290
 make-up remover wipe off all the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.600
 rest of shadows that I could 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.730
 fall into the eyecup and the rest of the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.530
 face why I first start with the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.330
 eyes and then I put on my face 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.980
 whole and now I'm still eyebrows 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.170
 just give me the maquillo with shadow 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.480
 following me in a natural way that as 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.700
 you see I do not have a lot of abundance so 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.920
 I try to cover the holes so that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.840
 everything is more even, the eyebrows are 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.240
 very important in makeup so 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.460
 make up you good and now with a 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.900
 white shadow and that brush what I'm going to 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.570
 do is enlighten me the bow of the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.060
 eyebrows simply by following the form of 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.620
 my eyebrow just below and integrating it with 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.620
 the shadows that I put on the eyelid 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.300
 and now we are going to delineate I'm going to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.980
 use that eyeliner that you see 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.990
 It looks super good and I will continue 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.210
 simply the angle with which I have made 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.180
 the bone shadows following the angle of 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.710
 my lower eyelid up so 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.800
 As you can see, I'm like a kind of 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.170
 triangulito and delineates me a little bit 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.870
 the upper lashes but not all the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.750
 eyelid but more or less like two 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.620
 thirds of the lash line without 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.620
 get to the lacrimal 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.790
 and now for the lower lashes 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.440
 below as a third and as I say shot 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.360
 up with the same angle and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.520
 fill all the holes so that it is 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.520
 well the intense black eyeliner 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.650
 I curl my eyelashes I made mascara 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.170
 especially at the end so that it is 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.090
 as an appearance of false eyelashes because 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.680
 I was not going to put on but you can also 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.870
 look great if you put lashes 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.760
 and as there is a shadow in the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.860
 eyelashes I also recommend that you 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.510
 put the mask over the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.630
 tabs and then below to 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.490
 upload them and also in the lower ones 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.710
 I apply mask simply at the end 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.259
 I outlined the entire water line with a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.120
 black pencil both above and by 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.120
 below but without reaching the tear 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.040
 now I'm going to start with the face I'm going 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.140
 to correct the dark circles the redness and 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.480
 everything you want to hide with corrector 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.180
 I'll blur it and I'll 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.340
 integrate well I use that brochita 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.380
 that is from sedona lazy all my makeup 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.390
 What I teach is sedona leis is worth 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.610
 if you are curious 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.040
 I lit up the lacrimal with that brush and 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.210
 a shadow clarita and integrated it well with 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.210
 the rest of the shadows 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.820
 I have not made a glass because I think I 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.860
 I do not need it so I just 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.260
 after the concealer I apply my 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.010
 compact powders that are doll and wings 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.010
 and I love it 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.919
 and I think that with that is enough 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.110
 true then he applied my blusher to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.540
 soft little touches so as not to overdo it 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.540
 if anything and then I'll be blurring 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.330
 and now I 'm going to outline the face 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.800
 with a brown shadow and with that brochita 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.800
 from there under the blues 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.319
 as did concern me all the 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.659
 I wanted to blur eyeshadows 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.340
 a little bit more so just with 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.139
 that brush what I'm blurring 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.139
 so you do not notice much the cut 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.009
 and that's how it was great, I'm going to do 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.620
 as smaller the nose simply 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.960
 casting shadow on the sides and by 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.939
 down right on the tip and also a 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.099
 little in the way to disguise the 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:30.309
 elongated nose I've done a little bit 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.930
 just below the lower lip to 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.839
 give the impression that I have lips 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.849
 as more bulky because that's the way 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.650
 shadow and it looks like you have the lips 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.629
 more stuffed finally I'm going to throw 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.229
 a little bit of illuminator above the 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.229
 rouge 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.330
 I'm just missing my lips and I'm going to 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.160
 use that orange that I think that 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.320
 combines perfection with the shadows of 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.540
 I'm going to take my eyes inside and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.310
 I'm going to blur it with my fingers and 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.110
 Finally I would lie down and only the 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.110
 gloss and it would be ready 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.300
 do not forget to tell me if you like this 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.300
 makeup and if you will use it 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.289
 and this has been all for today I hope that 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.789
 I liked you a lot I leave you for 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.169
 here my channel saint winter itself 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.240

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.250
