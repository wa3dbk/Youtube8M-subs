00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello everyone I'm the pure net and today I'm uploading my first video about 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.890
 the myths and urban legends of video games and how I could not upload it 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.769
 jalogüín then I started looking for myths about curses 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.329
 ghosts deaths 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.169
 or something paranormal the supernatural and here the good video so let's start with 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.579
 majora's mask the curse of ben the legend begins when a boy 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.980
 buy some second-hand n64 games and an old man sells him a cartridge 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.499
 somewhat worn with the name major has scored with marker 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.220
 when putting the game the young note that there is a file saved with the name of ben 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.290
 the saved file is quite advanced but not finished 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.920
 although the game runs well 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.640
 some flaws in the textures suggest to the child that it is a 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.600
 beta version of majora's cell mask 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.910
 everything runs well 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.380
 the young man names his character as a link 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.720
 nevertheless the game calls it indistinctly with this name as they see 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.270
 when you think that the saved game has a strange bug, it erases it 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.380
 however this action causes the screen to display rare dialogues 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.390
 that the music starts to play backwards and that macabre laughs appear 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.010
 the background repeating continuously 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.100
 suddenly the game restarts creating a file called the drowned uned 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.010
 onscreen 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.150
 sculpted seems to kill bemba ralink again and again of stormy forms 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.780
 not only that, but the character of the boy dies drowned 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.900
 impossible thing since the connoisseurs of the game know that an area can 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.770
 breathe underwater 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 scared 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.160
 the guy straps the old man's house to ask what happens 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.030
 arriving 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.970
 there is no one at home 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 the neighbors corroborate 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.960
 in fact, an old stranger lives in the place although it is rarely necessary 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.909
 the boy asks if they know of any prize to which the neighbors respond 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.990
 which is the name of a young man who died and eight years earlier in an accident 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
 terrible and who lived before in the old man's house 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.670
 i guessed come drowned 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 come on with a pokemon that goes round the game of the nintendo wii pokémon beat 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.549
 of revolution 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.100
 which has a curse that says if you play at four in the morning 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.720
 and you choose a team of only electric pokémons and in the team 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.799
 you put pikachu 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.450
 when you start a pikachu battle it will appear unchanging its legs will grow 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.650
 his fangs will enlarge and tune and after that he will leave the screen 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.849
 you rape her and after taking out the intestines and she will kill you 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.919
 let's continue with the curse kill until 99 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.749
 I did not kill did not fit the cover always 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 let's remember 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.389
 that he never played because of a pre-season injury with his first and only 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.099
 team 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.380
 the eagles that made him retreat 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.260
 auqnue after the area a super bowl as coach 1999 there were that year two 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.540

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.870
 the ball escaped and the ball was intercepted by the other team 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.789
 causing the defeat of the team and a year later suffered an injury 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:14.919
 2002 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.719
 this time it was the turn of the ute culpeper 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.479

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.270
 a classic one of the nfl game and a new version where you were a coach 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.309
 of a team 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.019

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.689

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.970
 steers that is the red hedgehog sonic mate this is said to be worse than 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.270
 call him and he is represented with the numbers 11 2 points 25 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.169
