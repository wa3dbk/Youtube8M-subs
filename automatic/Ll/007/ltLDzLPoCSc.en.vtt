00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 hello, we are preparing an oven chicken for us 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.099
 need of course potatoes 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.500
 the chicken itself is onion well out of the basics basically 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.330
 all so first of all let's 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.740
 do the chicken with you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:26.939
 so i took a cup of chicken in advance i 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:30.619
 pulled out now what you see is not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:36.960
 some kind of American crust 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.360
 this is no american breast this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 everything is okay chickens after i buy 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 I cut a whole hen and honors everyone 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.710
 chickens I also picked up such here I am 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.440
 was purchased 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.559
 and the tears of all these straps and matches and 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.050
 we got a snack 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 so the wings let's basically they are ready 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.570
 chicken we are going to cut you 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.570
 parts so i take away the pain here and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 separately in a bowl we are all this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 case for salt, add spices for kebabs 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:28.829
 and no mayonnaise circumstances caused me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 I do not put because the chicken itself 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.829
 bold mayonnaise is clearly not necessary here is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.439
 unequivocally, so far we remove here also 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 was 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:57.340
 we also cut into several pieces 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 about as well in three parts, and so 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.039
 As for the wings, we will decompose 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.939
 now it's all business 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.170
 salt and add spices so I went 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.959
 put it all there we will get a pack of spices 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:29.019
 and salt first we start with large 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:40.410
 hen we salted here asalim and remember 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:43.410
 and of course salt our 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.410
 wings 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.130
 so everything compared to they do not add 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.130
 spice 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.490
 as for the wings give him and in 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:33.150
 back side is also slightly salted 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:37.010
 just a little bit but the way until we 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.010
 salt let's turn on the oven 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:46.710
 warm up so well everybody turn on 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.340
 front side and also add here 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.340
 urged 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.020
 all this spread all this all here 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.000
 lowers us quietly salted 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:18.419
 insist it all then we remove everything 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.130
 we donâ€™t need it like this yet 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:31.730
 let 's do ad finem add that 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.730
 a little bit of oil and brush grease 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:49.810
 ready now we cut you 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:53.490
 potatoes can be cut into slices 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:06.610
 but I usually cut into cubes 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:09.639
 just so brazenly scofidio so on large 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.120
 cube everything i will cut into a large cube 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.760
 As for onions, tattoo is bad, not much 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.169
 Must cut into half and Tallinn 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.260
 do not need to cut a thin straw 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:27.460
 roughly blue axes thin she cut 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.740
 can continue continue potatoes i 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:38.310
 let's cut it right along the way 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.310
 salted somewhere a pinch of salt mix 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:54.189
 Now, neatly, how do we lay out with 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:06:08.520
 soft registration so that we crumble out 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:08.520
 all and all his to sprinkle sudochek and 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:34.360
 now we will lay out the meat so 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:36.669
 proceed laying wings so well, all 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.499
 we remove the resulting beauty in 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:44.949
 bake the oven at 200 220 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:49.749
 Maximum degree but I think 200 is normal 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:54.149
 there will be details on 30-40, so we proceed 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:54.149
 Well, we check what we did 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:07.530
 tank here it is our chicken and a knife 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:10.680
 poke potatoes here if it is soft 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:14.569
 We know what is ready if the chicken is golden 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:18.080
 here, too, everything is ready that I turn off and 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:18.080
 we start the meal
