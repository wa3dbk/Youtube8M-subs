Lima yellow I kind of started without

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.379 
Lima yellow I kind of started without
talking<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.869> need<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.380> four<00:01:40.679> feet<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:42.359> a

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
talking you need to make four feet to a

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.510 
talking you need to make four feet to a
part<00:01:42.719> of<00:01:42.810> each<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.319> or<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:44.009> apart<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.429> you're

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
part of each one or one apart if you're

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.459 
part of each one or one apart if you're
going<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> bottom<00:01:45.179> two<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.929> then<00:01:46.109> to<00:01:46.289> up

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
going by the bottom two and then to up

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.219 
going by the bottom two and then to up
then<00:01:47.039> build<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.789> layer<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.240> top<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> two

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
then build a layer on top that's the two

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
then build a layer on top that's the two
extra<00:01:49.560> each<00:01:49.740> side<00:01:50.009> build<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.429> up<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.880> build<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
extra each side build it up to build a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.169 
extra each side build it up to build a
layer<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.039> then<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.880> build

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
layer and then we are going to build

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.669 
layer and then we are going to build
another<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.319> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> really

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
another one of these so this is a really

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.219 
another one of these so this is a really
simple<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.299> shouldn't<00:02:00.299> last<00:02:00.600> much<00:02:00.899> more

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
simple one shouldn't last much more

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.390 
simple one shouldn't last much more
couple<00:02:01.889> of<00:02:01.950> minutes

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:17.280 

like<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.720> then<00:02:07.990> there's<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.350> more<00:02:16.290> now

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
like that and then there's one more now

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.580 
like that and then there's one more now
I<00:02:17.350> won't<00:02:17.890> pre<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> later<00:02:18.910> date<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:19.210> I<00:02:19.590> learn

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
I won't pre a later date when I learn

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.360 
I won't pre a later date when I learn
when<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.910> design<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.620> how<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> add<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
when I like design it how to add the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.490 
when I like design it how to add the
jetpack<00:02:24.820> onto<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:25.600> that's<00:02:25.930> kind<00:02:26.410> of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
jetpack onto it but that's kind of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.130 
jetpack onto it but that's kind of
tricky<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:28.360> tricky<00:02:28.570> making<00:02:28.930> round

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
tricky because it's tricky making round

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
tricky because it's tricky making round
shapes<00:02:29.380> but<00:02:30.130> yeah<00:02:30.370> I'll<00:02:31.030> be<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.780> second<00:02:32.170> i'll

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
shapes but yeah I'll be one second i'll

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.940 
shapes but yeah I'll be one second i'll
pause<00:02:32.560> came<00:02:33.280> back<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.450> let's<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.230> Dagan

again and it was six so i got my design

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.370 
again and it was six so i got my design
I<00:02:51.550> prepped<00:02:52.060> screenshotted<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.050> my<00:02:53.140> test

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
I prepped screenshotted it for my test

I prepped screenshotted it for my test
world<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:54.580> anyone's<00:02:54.970> wondering<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:55.720> on

world if anyone's wondering what I'm on

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.580 
world if anyone's wondering what I'm on
about<00:02:55.900> four<00:02:56.740> five<00:02:57.610> six<00:02:58.000> that's<00:02:58.300> perfect<00:02:58.810> and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
about four five six that's perfect and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.160 
about four five six that's perfect and
we're<00:02:59.770> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> go<00:03:00.070> up<00:03:00.310> diagonal<00:03:01.170> up

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
we're going to go up diagonal up

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.850 
we're going to go up diagonal up
diagonal<00:03:02.709> again<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:04.390> diagonal<00:03:04.959> again<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
diagonal again up diagonal again and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.270 
diagonal again up diagonal again and
then<00:03:08.860> up<00:03:09.250> diagonal<00:03:09.790> again<00:03:10.800> we're<00:03:11.800> now<00:03:11.950> going

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
then up diagonal again we're now going

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
then up diagonal again we're now going
to<00:03:12.340> come<00:03:12.519> back<00:03:12.640> down<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.330> can't<00:03:13.630> turn

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
to come back down to here I can't turn

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.460 
to come back down to here I can't turn
let's<00:03:14.350> do<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:16.630> are<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.200> build

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
let's do that and we are going to build

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.150 
let's do that and we are going to build
one<00:03:17.860> out<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> side<00:03:20.489> build<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:22.180> up<00:03:23.160> take

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
one out to the side build it to up take

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.870 
one out to the side build it to up take
that<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:27.640> diagonal<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> side<00:03:29.880> up

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
that out up diagonal and to the side up

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.210 
that out up diagonal and to the side up
diagonal<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.800> off-diagonal<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.950> link

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
diagonal and off-diagonal then just link

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.870 
diagonal and off-diagonal then just link
them

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.420 

so<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.330> count<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.620> place<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
so then count one in and place one and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.570 
so then count one in and place one and
again<00:03:47.880> one<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.270> again<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.750> place<00:03:49.440> one<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
again one in again and place one so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.630 
again one in again and place one so
that's<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.910> eyes<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.450> doodle<00:03:52.069> then<00:03:53.069> we

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
that's the eyes of the doodle then we

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.130 
that's the eyes of the doodle then we
are<00:03:53.849> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.209> bring<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:56.360> ok<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.420> I'm<00:03:57.660> back<00:03:57.840> ya

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
are going to bring it ok so I'm back ya

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.050 
are going to bring it ok so I'm back ya
know<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.380> pause<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.709> again<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.550> disruption

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
know to pause it again just a disruption

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.530 
know to pause it again just a disruption
in<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.840> background<00:04:01.349> so<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.160> total<00:04:02.849> 5<00:04:03.120> so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
in the background so this is total 5 so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.479 
in the background so this is total 5 so
5<00:04:03.569> like<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.880> then<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:06.180> diagonal<00:04:07.489> down

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
5 like that then up diagonal down

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:17.270 
5 like that then up diagonal down
diagonal<00:04:09.860> free<00:04:12.920> down<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.750> join<00:04:16.280> so

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
diagonal free down like that and join so

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.099 
diagonal free down like that and join so
