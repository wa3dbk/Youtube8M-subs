00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.160
 updated among other things 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 It's really cool so it fits well if you see 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:24.369

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.850
 to all games related to launch 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.869
 most are all country pages 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:41.619

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:45.720
 ju multimedia keyboard and more 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:51.280
 security stuff and felt that london's 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.830
 mold everything everything here challenge is the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.750
 list of those that will be updated tô 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.850
 needing updating 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.220
 here in my case these three are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.659
 Presenter, I'll be there later. 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 People here are the ones who will be 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.110
 updated later 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.310
 in my case I think I do not have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.690
 too young 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:20.400
 but this was the first one that is already here 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.349
 is all that's what pec are caught are 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.239
 all the apps you have 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.950
 downloaded at the circus 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.620
 in my case it seems much more in her 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 because things were already his, others are not 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 what releases you to use host chip 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.130
 any chip type is enough - it is 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.130
 enough to say it here 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.300
 It does not work there anymore. 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.110
 I also have the multitouch sun gesture 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.720
 twenty-two of them here, so do I 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 I wake up so much is better than 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.990
 has not done well in jaú surgas 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.990
 here you will add the pages 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:21.930
 here the traditional is very easy to link 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:26.580
 Inject is to type the url only this 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 85 I do it, everybody can do it 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.530
 and store is what memory you have 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:43.620
 still to download when you advertise and 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.620
 The memory of your device is 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.940
 being still has in my case with beam 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.320
 free and not private 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.840
 I have 16 of no excuse and in the system 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.769
 to download things do not get day 12 for one 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.390
 day and at the same private time as 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.549
 apps out of these things I have 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:15.340
 16.4 say but there is almost everything 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:18.640
 busy with games Apps things then it is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.370
 What this number does here is in the 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.550
 sorry then I liked it and if you will be 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.210
 a normal use a rock where the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:35.520
 developer is normal is that the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.520
 apps name rained 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.820
 the skoke board 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.710
 He washed it and up rope for you. 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.840
 install the application 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.810
 when you open you will see here 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.810
 side install you click to install 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.790
 something that went wrong but not you 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.210
 It will work out the best because I did not find 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.090
 load without patience 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.190
 Maybe here 's the one that's with 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.990
 the dirty name is original 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.670
 so that the tool alone 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:22.170
 right only problem of it is that you pay 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:25.440
 and well I have eyelashes not only things 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.870
 for piracy but I will not pay for 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.550
 a noxious thing 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.760
 so that's why I have the strength 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.860
 pirates then let her out on the 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.030
 description is this personal until the next 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.030
