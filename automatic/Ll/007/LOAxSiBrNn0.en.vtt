 Hello, friends from all over Bulgaria! 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 My name is Theodore Zhekov from Burgas. 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:30.000
 I watched in Facebook showcased clips about Cochlear implant Ci that complain of deaf people. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 I'm glad the deaf are against Cochlear Implant Ci, I'm also against. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 There is no point in surgery, I watched the photos uploaded to the facebook, I can not watch them put on so sweet babies, and it became pity and hard for them and it hurts me this is a human being !!! 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 Some time ago we saw Sylvia and talked about Ci. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:28.050
 I want to tell you this video. Years ago I was 17 years old in 2007. 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 I trained football with the audience and wore a hearing aid. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 One day I came home, someone called my mother and it was from a doctor, and my mother called me to talk about a cochlear implant. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 At first I did not understand what it means ??? 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:10.520
 And they explained to me that it was a new kind of apparatus - they said I could talk and talk to the normal people and work with them. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 And this Ci is an operation, and I do not agree with that, my mother insisted, the next day he was again praying, and I hesitated, and I decided to do it. 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.370
 They put me Ci and I felt strange and quite different, and it's not like before 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:55.080
 I went to a speech therapist to learn the different sounds, I'm not used to Ci-it's different, and the hearing aid is better than Ci. 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 I met friends to have coffee and asked me why I did Ci and said it was not supposed to have made sense to Ci. 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:35.550
 That's why I interrupted my favorite sport because I accidentally hurt myself or someone hit me and I had to keep a lot 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.070
 And I can not do sports, I really like to do sports. 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:59.070
 After a while I found out that there was a badminton sport and I decided to participate, the deaf people knew me and congratulated me, and they also said that it was not supposed to be better without that Ci. 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 Then we were entertained, and I could not do anything and remained speechless, and I could not find a topic of communication before Ci was cheerful and playful, and now I changed my brain and my body. 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 The badminton team taught me to talk with the mimic, culturally and well-educated. 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 After a while I went to make the settings of Ci and increased, but I did not hear anything, but I felt vibrations coming to my eyes and I felt something was wrong. 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:45.630
 Outside of the streets, cars, buses, all kinds of noises, and my eyes began to vibrate, I took it away, I started to worry. 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:06.660
 Two years passed and an ear infection occurred, I went to a doctor and looked at me, and gave me a medicine, 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:25.140
 a few days passed and the pain came again, and I went to a doctor again and they told me I had to do surgery and it became bad and I did not know what to do. 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:35.950
 Later I realized and I asked the doctor if he could remove this implant, 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.490
 then decided that I could remove Ci for free 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:50.050
 and then I felt fresh and better than before. 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:59.690
 There is a difference of Ci and without Ci. 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.300
 I want to tell you all, 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 this is completely damaging to the person himself, 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.940
 did you see what happened to me? 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.340
 Many thanks to the badminton team, 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.940
 that they taught me everything and saved my soul. 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.560
 Thank you for your attention !!! I love you!
