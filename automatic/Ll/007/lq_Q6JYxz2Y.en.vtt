any<00:01:50.920> camera<00:01:51.250> right<00:01:51.790> off<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> bat<00:01:52.240> see<00:01:52.720> the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
any camera right off the bat see the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.260 
any camera right off the bat see the
little<00:01:52.900> thing<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.620> says<00:01:53.830> shutter<00:01:54.700> speed<00:01:55.090> if

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
little thing that says shutter speed if

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.030 
little thing that says shutter speed if
you<00:01:55.570> raise<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.140> number<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.710> make<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.890> longer

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
you raise that number to make it longer

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.310 
you raise that number to make it longer
whenever<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.060> take<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.300> picture<00:01:58.600> now<00:01:58.900> your

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
whenever you take a picture now your

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.590 
whenever you take a picture now your
camera<00:01:59.830> will<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.670> several<00:02:01.000> seconds

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
camera will be on for several seconds

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.170 
camera will be on for several seconds
taking<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.530> picture<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.520> amount<00:02:03.940> of<00:02:04.120> time

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
taking a picture for that amount of time

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
now this is really cool because what you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100 
now this is really cool because what you
can<00:02:06.250> do<00:02:06.400> is<00:02:06.550> take<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.790> light<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.480> then<00:02:07.780> move<00:02:07.990> it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
can do is take a light and then move it

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.600 
can do is take a light and then move it
around<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.470> frame<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.489> actually

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
around the frame and you can actually

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.479 
around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:10.149> light<00:02:10.720> trails<00:02:11.019> with<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.409> and<00:02:11.680> people

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
record light trails with that and people
