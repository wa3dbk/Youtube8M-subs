00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so it just gets in the way just slice

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
so it just gets in the way just slice
that<00:00:54.059> through<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.719> sharp<00:00:54.989> knife<00:00:55.079> do

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
actually really very simple you don't

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually really very simple you don't
need<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> stuff<00:01:09.570> them<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.770> concept<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
