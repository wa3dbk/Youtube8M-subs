00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.209
 here's the problem here or the vector is 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.180
 corrosion is well known 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.210
 corrodes from inside and outside in and out 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.960
 My trunk is corroded 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.520
 because somewhere above is leaking 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.520
 Now I will look for exactly where 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.359
 where does water flow from 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.359
 look inside the trunk with a flashlight 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.830
 one drop went 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 Kirill Manat 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.410
 he 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.719
 Maxim is lucky from under the rear 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.390
 where the lantern jumps from above 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:29.430
 comfortable trunk so on top 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.430
 don't write last time i 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:45.180
 found a hole and so I understand no longer 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:47.750
 flows here leaked through the rear through 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.750
 taillights
