00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the framerate was so low that my

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.440 
the framerate was so low that my
recording<00:03:14.980> equipment<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.669> it<00:03:15.819> was<00:03:15.939> it

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
came up just horrible quality afterwards

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.319 
came up just horrible quality afterwards
I<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.079> retrospect<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.889> was<00:03:21.010> kind<00:03:21.159> of<00:03:21.299> huh

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
I in retrospect so it was kind of huh

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.300
