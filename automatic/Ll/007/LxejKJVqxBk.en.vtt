saying<00:01:23.950> new<00:01:24.250> world<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:24.990> Hoenn<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.259> not<00:01:27.190> really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
saying new world but Hoenn is not really

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.880 
saying new world but Hoenn is not really
new<00:01:28.000> because<00:01:28.420> we've<00:01:28.929> already<00:01:29.200> seen<00:01:29.530> how<00:01:29.740> and

there are so many possibilities memories
we<00:02:59.980> can't<00:03:00.190> really<00:03:00.400> speculate<00:03:00.700> at<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:00.970> time

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
we can't really speculate at this time

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120 
we can't really speculate at this time
with<00:03:01.420> with<00:03:01.630> such<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.140> evidence<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:02.680> not

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
with with such a little evidence but not

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.350 
with with such a little evidence but not
to<00:03:03.250> mention<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.610> fact<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.820> they<00:03:03.970> obviously

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
to mention the fact that they obviously

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.750 
to mention the fact that they obviously
be<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.050> battle<00:03:05.380> frontier<00:03:05.830> which<00:03:06.100> will<00:03:06.430> cover

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
be a battle frontier which will cover

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640 
be a battle frontier which will cover
all<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.480> move<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.080> AZ<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.350> aren't

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
all of the move to AZ that aren't

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.550 
all of the move to AZ that aren't
available<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:09.400> pokemon<00:03:10.300> X&amp;Y<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.989> finally<00:03:11.440> we

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
available in pokemon X&amp;Y so finally we

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560 
available in pokemon X&amp;Y so finally we
can<00:03:11.920> actually<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.370> teach<00:03:12.850> 6th<00:03:13.269> gen<00:03:13.420> pokemon

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
can actually like teach 6th gen pokemon

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.540 
can actually like teach 6th gen pokemon
some<00:03:13.930> decent<00:03:14.260> moves<00:03:14.440> with<00:03:14.890> move<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.400> us

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
some decent moves with move to us

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.370 
some decent moves with move to us
hopefully<00:03:16.180> these<00:03:16.630> are<00:03:16.780> all<00:03:16.840> little<00:03:16.959> theories

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
hopefully these are all little theories

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.900
