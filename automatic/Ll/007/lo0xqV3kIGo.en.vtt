real<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:33.739> what<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> did<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.610> lower<00:00:35.790> the

piece<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> fuel<00:00:46.230> line<00:00:46.500> cut<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> certain

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
piece of fuel line cut to a certain

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.520 
piece of fuel line cut to a certain
length<00:00:48.510> put<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> shop<00:00:50.250> shaft<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:52.140> limit

length put it on the shop shaft to limit

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.510 
length put it on the shop shaft to limit
its<00:00:52.710> outward<00:00:53.390> downward<00:00:54.390> travel<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> way

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
its outward downward travel so that way

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
its outward downward travel so that way
I<00:00:56.550> didn't<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> cut<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:57.480> coils<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I didn't have to cut any coils off the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.580 
I didn't have to cut any coils off the
spring<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.250> anything<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:01.350> works

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
spring or anything like that it works

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.679 
spring or anything like that it works
really<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:03.589> it's<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.769> pretty<00:01:05.040> low<00:01:05.360> in<00:01:06.360> hard

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
really good it's it's pretty low in hard

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.679 
really good it's it's pretty low in hard
turns<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.770> tends<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> scrape<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.510> bit

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
turns it tends to scrape a little bit

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.870 
turns it tends to scrape a little bit
but<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.820> guess<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.450> price<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.869> pay

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
but I guess that's the price you pay

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.660 
but I guess that's the price you pay
right<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.240> running<00:01:15.420> under<00:01:16.020> Trey<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
half or so above the chassis kind of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.780 
half or so above the chassis kind of
wraps<00:01:28.860> around<00:01:30.770> supposed<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> keep<00:01:31.979> dirt<00:01:32.310> rocks

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
wraps around supposed to keep dirt rocks

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
wraps around supposed to keep dirt rocks
and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> thing<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.680> does

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and that kind of thing out all it does

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
and that kind of thing out all it does
is<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.250> collect<00:01:36.000> everything<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.689> tires

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is just collect everything the tires

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.980 
is just collect everything the tires
throw<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> did<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.960> just

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
throw up there so what I did was just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.990 
throw up there so what I did was just
trim<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.409> just<00:01:43.409> basically<00:01:44.100> look<00:01:44.729> cool

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
trim it down to just basically look cool

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
trim it down to just basically look cool
you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:46.140> much<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.590> does

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you know it's pretty much all it does
