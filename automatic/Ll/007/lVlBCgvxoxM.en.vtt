 every 5 goals to 0 before the box 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.090
 bolivar that came as a pointer and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.090
 favorite to this encounter 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.860
 the beast was winning the people 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 brother 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.360
 with this first goal 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.530
 at 11 minutes it was Pablo Salinas 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 first goal 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.739
 and then at 14 miguel angel rosemary 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.470

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.170
 aviator 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.170
 a message on the shirt to dedicate it 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.870
 and take everything in the attack 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 these plays arrive where the goalkeeper 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 Argüello rebounds at 35 minutes 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.340
 Gerardo Garcia all in the first half 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 decreed a new goal and the third 35 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 minutes and Stephen was already winning by three 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 goals to zero to the people of bolivar and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 week formed with Cartagena in tier 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.560
 rye rivera garcía rosemary peace and other 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.560
 They poured double in salinas and from francesco 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 Fourth goal for aviator people to Pablo 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 salinas again marks at 42 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 minutes of commitment four goals in 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.159
 the first stage they could not believe it if 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.340
 the technical body players much less 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.829
 the supporters of bolívar 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.489
 I expected that guy just depends on 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.500
 Lyon to be comfortable up there 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.510
 in the standings another goal 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.629
 remember of Pablo Salinas second in 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.650
 your personal account for this match 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.910
 we were already with images of the second 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.140
 weather 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.480

 fusila to argüello guardavallas of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 bolivar and in the bounce can define from 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.569
 good way 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 olive groves had with argüello and navarra 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.230
 working moral tape cardoso contained 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.769

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.769
 maple rabbit 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.560
 so the fifth goal then comes from the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 view people pay the 52 minutes 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 hundreds 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.010
 let's go to the notes after this 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.010
 commitment 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.870
 yes yes I think I was always told by a 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.230
 technical whenever you are prepared to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.109
 all 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.519
 I noticed less plans but well I think 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.530
 we train to the fullest always in 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.689
 all the workouts for every time 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.790
 what happens this kind of right that you 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.319
 happened to eris had to leave in the last 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.079
 practice but good I think we 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.819
 we focus with a very mentality 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.250
 positive I think it's nice place these 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.810
 classics we really wanted to play it and 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.170
 I've taken that revenge we had the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.909
 peace and the and also up to the previous 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.129
 match with blooming I'm good team 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.840
 as I told you in our week that is 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.189
 important that we have there is a 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.650
 reference man I do not think we've 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.359
 played collectively very well in attack 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.310
 the team is generous in all 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.689
 lines and there have been many 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.400
 players who have practically scratched 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.590
 perception and I believe that there is 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.639
 congratulate the goalkeeper what he has done 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.639
 two spectacular stops
