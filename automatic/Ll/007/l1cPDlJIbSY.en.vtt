00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.880
 in short, all the boys need to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.020
 welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.990
 today let's see how we can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.939
 insert subtitles in a video like 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.410
 you are already wind beneath me are 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 subtitles appear 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.520
 this because because lately in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.370
 these last few days we have worked 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 to the realization of the subtitles for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 some of our videos the most viewed ones 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.809
 or those sought in such a way as to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.579
 open the blogger not just to a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 national public but not an audience 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 international so let's go straight to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 see how to insert in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 subtitle individuals then 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 first of all what we need 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.210
 we need to download a simple program 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 called millet millet is a program 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 free we can find 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 simply faith and allows us to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.909
 create your own subtitles for gods 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.450
 video once loaded millet we go 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.049
 to open here here is the screen 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.030
 main 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.240
 and here we should go to select the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 our video and so I go to live on 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 change and select my video in which 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.290
 video as we can see comes now 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.770
 open in the preview here crazy 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 resolution information 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 to frames per second 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.680
 in the overlays window I go to 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.450
 replace this information with 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 mine we put in canvas aids 1920 x 1080 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.740
 that would be for resolution while 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.649
 we are born framerate we put 30 or 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 if our video at a framerate why 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.920
 is not present in the list we click 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.729
 on the insert our key ring 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 rail 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:09.660
 so I enter 31.5 179 and do 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.400
 click ok 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.319
 and here is our preview 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.920
 updated with the dimensions we have 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.230
 promised 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.510
 now we have three windows we already have 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.360
 seen the window for view that there 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.890
 will show the preview of our video 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.370
 because obviously we have to see it for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.560
 to be able to write subtitles we have the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.870
 subtitles window that allows us 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
 precisely to create subtitles to set 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.910
 the time is there from the will yield and we then have the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 mini player that will allow us to run 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 forward back into the video put in 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.430
 pause go to a frame forward one frame 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.530
 back 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.349
 etcetera etc. let's start right away 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.060
 then to create our video ad 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.920
 example I go to any part of the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.920
 video I click on the play button 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.569
 we then click ok and how 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.360
 we can see will appear in this 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.060
 window an object this object is not 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.620
 other than our subtitle in 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.810
 this case is called text 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.610
 because as default 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 every time we return to the kuwait button 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.360
 the subtitle text here on the left 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.670
 we see the information regarding the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.879
 time we have therefore inbound since 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.849
 subtitle that happens at 26.09 seconds 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.799
 in the end that always comes at 26.0 9 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.470
 seconds then these all from 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.530
 set let's say that I want to do 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.079
 start the video from my subtitle 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.140
 from clint of 26 09 seconds then I go 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.140
 forward 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.510
 take viterbo for example here where 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.120
 I want my our title 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.319
 they disappear and I click out 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.250
 obviously selecting mine 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.040
 subtitle now as you can see the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 length has changed part always from 26 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.780
 09 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.340
 but this time ends 29 and 28 ok for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.380
 change our subtitle 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.260
 obviously double click here 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.870
 tex and as you can see now we can 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.609
 edit our text now i have 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.019
 entered my subtitle for you me 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.739
 creating another is simply enough for me 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.209
 click on which we make sure we have 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 correctly set times then 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.880
 at the end of the previous subtitle 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.820
 part the next one 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.370
 I'm going to change that too 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.979
 subtitle ok let's move on 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.060
 official photo and I want it to end here 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.919
 now let's select the first one 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.530
 subtitle because you love the meal god 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.340
 selection in this case will go to the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.710
 then selection at the beginning of the first 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.000
 subtitle 0 26 seconds as we can 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.090
 see also here from the player 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.930
 let's play them 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.680
 we explain the application and appear 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.720

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.240
