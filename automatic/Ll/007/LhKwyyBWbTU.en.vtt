00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.870 
cutlery or something I'm always testing
it<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.210> piece<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> metal<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.710> magnetic<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it if a piece of metal is magnetic you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.899 
it if a piece of metal is magnetic you
know<00:01:39.150> 100%<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.520> precious

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
know 100% that it is not a precious

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
know 100% that it is not a precious
metal<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.350> magnetic<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
metal now if it's not magnetic it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
metal now if it's not magnetic it
doesn't<00:01:44.310> prove<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.420> precious

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
doesn't prove that it is a precious

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
doesn't prove that it is a precious
metal<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.220> start

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
metal but it's a good start

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.560 
metal but it's a good start
so<00:01:48.240> let's<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.009> tap<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.280> tap<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.149> cut

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so let's look here tap this tap this cut

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.980 
so let's look here tap this tap this cut
this<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.130> seem<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.520> silver

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
this all of these seem to be silver

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.880 
this all of these seem to be silver
however<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.939> example<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.619> put

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
however this one for example if you put

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.910 
however this one for example if you put
down<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.610> magnet<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.079> real<00:02:01.259> close<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
down the magnet you get real close to it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780 
down the magnet you get real close to it
you<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> adheres<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.490> not

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you see how it adheres this is not

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.359 
you see how it adheres this is not
silver<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.740> got<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.160> careful

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
silver so you got to be really careful

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.800 
silver so you got to be really careful
this<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> best<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this is the best way you put it on the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
this is the best way you put it on the
flat<00:02:09.989> surface<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.190> touch<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.430> lightly

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
flat surface and just touch it lightly

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.589 
flat surface and just touch it lightly
and<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> drags

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
and if it drags

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.630 
and if it drags
it's<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:13.930> silver<00:02:14.319> so<00:02:15.010> that's<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.280> first<00:02:15.489> line

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
it's not silver so that's the first line

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.869 
it's not silver so that's the first line

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
something is silver or not on this spoon

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.949 
something is silver or not on this spoon
for<00:02:34.030> example<00:02:35.219> you<00:02:36.219> see<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.730> word<00:02:37.269> sterling

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
for example you see the word sterling

for example you see the word sterling
sterling<00:02:38.950> silver<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.669> ninety<00:02:40.030> two<00:02:40.209> percent

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
sterling silver is ninety two percent

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.149 
sterling silver is ninety two percent
ninety<00:02:40.959> two<00:02:41.079> point<00:02:41.260> five<00:02:41.469> percent<00:02:41.530> silver

ninety two point five percent silver

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.399 
ninety two point five percent silver
that<00:02:42.370> means<00:02:42.519> 925<00:02:43.510> particles<00:02:44.109> out<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
that means 925 particles out of a

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.610 
that means 925 particles out of a
thousand<00:02:44.859> particles<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.400> metal<00:02:45.700> are<00:02:46.060> silver

thousand particles of metal are silver

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.949 
thousand particles of metal are silver
so<00:02:47.620> that's<00:02:48.340> one<00:02:48.639> example<00:02:48.939> of<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.209> hallmark<00:02:49.599> but

is that eight hundred is fifty percent
whatever<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.760> but<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.270> really<00:04:35.420> confusing

like<00:05:54.590> that<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.070> start<00:05:55.220> seeing<00:05:55.580> smoke<00:05:56.060> you

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
like that and you start seeing smoke you

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.810 
like that and you start seeing smoke you
know<00:05:56.630> for<00:05:56.840> sure<00:05:56.870> that<00:05:57.230> it's<00:05:57.380> not<00:05:57.500> so<00:05:57.710> good<00:05:57.919> but

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
know for sure that it's not so good but

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.790 
know for sure that it's not so good but
look<00:05:59.000> here<00:05:59.240> when<00:06:00.140> I<00:06:00.169> put<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:02.270> spoon

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
look here when I put it on the spoon

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.510 
look here when I put it on the spoon
look<00:06:03.800> what<00:06:03.950> happens<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:07.040> turns<00:06:07.250> this

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
look what happens it turns this

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.170 
look what happens it turns this
brilliant<00:06:08.419> blue<00:06:08.690> color<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.410> icy<00:06:10.040> blue<00:06:10.310> that

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
brilliant blue color this icy blue that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.120 
brilliant blue color this icy blue that
is<00:06:11.390> what<00:06:11.510> you're<00:06:11.630> looking<00:06:11.870> for<00:06:12.110> that<00:06:12.710> blue

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
is what you're looking for that blue

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.380 
is what you're looking for that blue
color<00:06:13.430> is<00:06:13.730> without<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.600> doubt<00:06:15.190> silver<00:06:16.330> now<00:06:17.330> you

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
color is without a doubt silver now you

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.610 
color is without a doubt silver now you
want<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:17.690> make<00:06:17.780> sure<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.110> scratch<00:06:18.410> it

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
want to make sure that you scratch it

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.750 
want to make sure that you scratch it
deep<00:06:18.800> enough<00:06:18.919> because<00:06:19.250> sometimes<00:06:19.580> things

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
deep enough because sometimes things

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.250 
deep enough because sometimes things
that<00:06:19.850> are<00:06:19.970> silver-plated<00:06:20.450> will<00:06:20.840> still<00:06:21.050> just

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
that are silver-plated will still just

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.810 
that are silver-plated will still just
show<00:06:21.380> you<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.590> silver<00:06:21.830> plating<00:06:22.130> so<00:06:22.400> sometimes

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
show you the silver plating so sometimes

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.610 
show you the silver plating so sometimes
you<00:06:22.970> gotta<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:23.600> know<00:06:23.630> cut<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:23.990> item<00:06:24.320> in<00:06:24.440> half

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
you gotta you know cut the item in half

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.159 
you gotta you know cut the item in half
or<00:06:25.010> break<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.550> or<00:06:25.669> file<00:06:26.330> it<00:06:26.540> down<00:06:26.570> a<00:06:26.720> little<00:06:26.930> bit

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
or break it or file it down a little bit

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.150 
or break it or file it down a little bit
but<00:06:27.919> like<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.790> without<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:29.720> doubt<00:06:30.080> you<00:06:30.980> can

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
but like this without a doubt you can

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.190 
but like this without a doubt you can
tell<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:32.120> difference<00:06:32.540> and<00:06:32.840> you<00:06:32.930> can<00:06:32.960> tell

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
tell the difference and you can tell

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.320 
tell the difference and you can tell
what<00:06:33.350> silver<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:33.890> what's<00:06:34.039> not<00:06:34.220> so<00:06:35.210> that's

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
what silver and what's not so that's

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.749 
what silver and what's not so that's
basically<00:06:35.810> it

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
basically it

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.059 
basically it
the<00:06:37.059> easiest<00:06:37.479> three<00:06:37.990> simple<00:06:38.379> steps<00:06:38.439> to

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
the easiest three simple steps to

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.579 
the easiest three simple steps to
determining<00:06:39.490> authenticity<00:06:40.139> now<00:06:41.139> you<00:06:41.199> notice

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:41.589 
determining authenticity now you notice

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.279 
determining authenticity now you notice
that<00:06:41.620> we<00:06:41.830> didn't<00:06:42.039> get<00:06:42.129> to<00:06:42.189> coins<00:06:42.550> and<00:06:43.289> that's

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
that we didn't get to coins and that's

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.290 
that we didn't get to coins and that's
because<00:06:44.860> it's<00:06:45.009> a<00:06:45.129> totally<00:06:45.580> different<00:06:45.610> method

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
because it's a totally different method

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.929 
because it's a totally different method
of<00:06:46.419> determining<00:06:46.900> authenticity<00:06:47.400> but<00:06:48.400> these

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
of determining authenticity but these

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.290 
of determining authenticity but these
coins<00:06:49.360> are<00:06:49.599> indeed<00:06:49.990> silver<00:06:50.849> so<00:06:51.849> I<00:06:51.879> just<00:06:52.089> wanted

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
coins are indeed silver so I just wanted

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.149 
coins are indeed silver so I just wanted
to<00:06:52.419> get<00:06:52.599> you<00:06:53.080> know<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.529> ball<00:06:53.740> started<00:06:54.129> rolling

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
to get you know the ball started rolling

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.519 
to get you know the ball started rolling
on<00:06:54.669> you<00:06:55.059> know<00:06:55.150> get<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.360> ball<00:06:55.509> rolling<00:06:55.900> on<00:06:56.110> on

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
on you know get the ball rolling on on

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:58.709 
on you know get the ball rolling on on
how<00:06:57.099> to<00:06:57.129> determine<00:06:57.370> authenticity<00:06:57.819> so<00:06:58.509> in<00:06:58.599> this

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
how to determine authenticity so in this

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.390 
how to determine authenticity so in this
first<00:06:58.930> video<00:06:59.050> we<00:06:59.259> did<00:06:59.800> silver

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
first video we did silver
