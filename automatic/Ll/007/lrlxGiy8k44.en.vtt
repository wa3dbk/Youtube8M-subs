00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
way to think of it is that the recording

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
way to think of it is that the recording
medium<00:00:26.519> looks<00:00:27.090> through<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> lens<00:00:28.220> what's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
tricky about camera design is that if

this problem since the beginning of
photography<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> they've<00:00:41.820> come<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
photography and they've come up with

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690 
photography and they've come up with
lots<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> solutions<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:44.040> example<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.670> a

view camera you actually take the
recording<00:00:47.250> medium<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> can

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
recording medium off so that you can

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
medium look through that same lens so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
medium look through that same lens so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
can expose the image sensor and give me

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
can expose the image sensor and give me
a<00:01:41.490> viewfinder<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> lens<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a viewfinder you know where the lens is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
a viewfinder you know where the lens is
on<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.040> camera<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.610> course<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.299> the

my image sensor sits right back here
directly<00:01:48.780> behind<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.320> lens<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.890> light<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
directly behind the lens so light can

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.730 
directly behind the lens so light can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it can also get up here so that I can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530 
it's all done with mirrors light comes
into<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.560> lens<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.159> hits<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> mirror<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
into the lens and hits a mirror that's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.969 
into the lens and hits a mirror that's
sitting<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
sitting right here like this that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.280

now<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.139> just<00:03:50.769> have<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> learn<00:03:51.160> how<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.430> use<00:03:51.670> it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
now you just have to learn how to use it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.220 
now you just have to learn how to use it
but<00:03:52.060> you'll<00:03:52.299> learn<00:03:52.420> all<00:03:52.600> about<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.139> this

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
but you'll learn all about that in this

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.500
