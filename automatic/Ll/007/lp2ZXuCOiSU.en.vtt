00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.139
 no doubt the scientific method 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.139
 It has been the most powerful tool 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.679
 that scientists have had 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.010
 to explore 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.789
 about the truth 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.789
 reigning 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.749
 unknown 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.140
 that we try to solve 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 to every day 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.470
 clinical epidemiology 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 this the field of medicine 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 that has allowed to focus 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 the whole structure of knowledge 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.350
 to inform ordered 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.160
 evaluate 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.910
 assess 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.320
 research 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.450
 the prevailing uncertainty 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 we the clinical epidemiologists 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190
 We are in the capacity to offer 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.950
 to scientists 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.870
 a support for a farm 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.630
 from the conception of the research question 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 the ideal design for the realization 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.300
 of said investigation 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.100
 the support 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.470
 technical and pedagogical 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.870
 with regard 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 to close them while statistics 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.159
 and finally 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 The advice 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.880
 for the production of scientific articles 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.660
 solids 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 that have internal validity 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.800
 that have importance 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.390
 and finally 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.010
 that represents an advance that can fill 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 the doubt of existing knowledge 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.330
 and with this 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.800
 can be published 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.680
 in magazines 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 national or international aodi 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.999
 high international g strip 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.299
 clinical epidemiology 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.029
 It allows 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:24.749
 give the fundamental tools to conduct research 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.659
 with the other high standards 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 good advice from the beginning 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.499
 and in all the steps of the investigation 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.789
 they are the guarantee to obtain fruits 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.109
 who represents an advance 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.179
 both in the field 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.179
 World for the health of people 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.919
 as in the personal field 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.590
 for reputation 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.270
 of scientists
