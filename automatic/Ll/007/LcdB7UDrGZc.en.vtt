sure if there's a maxi guns or not but

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
sure if there's a maxi guns or not but
as<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> bottom<00:00:57.570> where

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
as you can see on the bottom where

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
as you can see on the bottom where
you're<00:00:57.870> always<00:00:58.079> gaining<00:00:58.379> 10<00:00:58.649> points<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.129> then

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you're always gaining 10 points and then

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
you're always gaining 10 points and then
you<00:00:59.399> gain<00:00:59.609> extra<00:01:00.030> points<00:01:00.480> due<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> double

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you gain extra points due to double

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.310 
you gain extra points due to double
points<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:03.239> killing<00:01:03.570> zombies<00:01:04.019> what

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
points and just killing zombies what

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.510 
points and just killing zombies what
nothing<00:01:04.619> um<00:01:05.510> basically<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.340> like

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
nothing um basically so what it's like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.160 
nothing um basically so what it's like
is<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> zombie<00:01:09.930> you're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
is that as your the zombie you're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.160 
is that as your the zombie you're
extremely<00:01:10.710> faster<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.240> um<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.020> guessing

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
extremely faster but um and I'm guessing

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
extremely faster but um and I'm guessing
the<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.830> kills<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> human

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the more kills you get is the human

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
the more kills you get is the human
you're<00:01:15.210> obviously<00:01:15.479> probably<00:01:16.049> getting<00:01:16.320> antsy

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you're obviously probably getting antsy

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.649 
you're obviously probably getting antsy
there<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.820> trying<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> could

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
also clogged the wall or I mean cover

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
also clogged the wall or I mean cover
someone<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> can't<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.119> through<00:01:21.330> carpet<00:01:21.659> okay

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
someone I can't go through carpet okay

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
someone I can't go through carpet okay
you<00:01:22.350> can't<00:01:22.619> act<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> zombie<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> fact

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you can't act like a zombie in the fact

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
you can't act like a zombie in the fact
of<00:01:24.299> being<00:01:24.360> able<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:25.619> things<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of being able to go through things and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
of being able to go through things and
whatnot<00:01:26.810> one<00:01:27.810> day<00:01:27.869> real<00:01:28.020> quick<00:01:28.170> switch<00:01:28.380> over

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
whatnot one day real quick switch over

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.569 
whatnot one day real quick switch over
to<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:28.650> character<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.250> got<00:01:29.400> pretty

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
to my character I think I got pretty

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
to my character I think I got pretty
farm<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> gutless<00:01:30.270> shirt<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> then

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
farm on the gutless shirt and then

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.460 
farm on the gutless shirt and then
basically<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.640> guys<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.900> weapons
