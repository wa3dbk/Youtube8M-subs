bandwidth when broadcasting their video

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.220 
bandwidth when broadcasting their video
there<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.790> four<00:01:00.180> channels<00:01:00.630> available<00:01:00.750> on

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there are four channels available on

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
there are four channels available on
those<00:01:01.410> cameras<00:01:01.860> however<00:01:02.310> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> try<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.060> put

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
those cameras however if you try to put

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
those cameras however if you try to put
cameras<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.840> four<00:01:04.079> of<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.009> video

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cameras and all four of them the video

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
cameras and all four of them the video
attempts<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> overlap<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> give<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.840> dirty

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
attempts to overlap and give you a dirty

attempts to overlap and give you a dirty
picture<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
picture so I'm going to do right now is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.510 
picture so I'm going to do right now is
I'm<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.440> take<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.800> heating<00:01:11.100> pad<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
I'm going to take our heating pad and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
I'm going to take our heating pad and
put<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> inside<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.300> microwave<00:01:12.479> oven<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
put it inside the microwave oven to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.649 
put it inside the microwave oven to
demonstrate<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> no<00:01:14.790> ill<00:01:15.000> effects<00:01:15.390> on

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
demonstrate that it is no ill effects on

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
demonstrate that it is no ill effects on
the<00:01:15.990> quality<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> video<00:01:16.680> from<00:01:17.280> our<00:01:17.400> digital

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the quality of video from our digital

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.430 

as<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.000> can<00:01:26.120> see<00:01:26.360> our<00:01:26.540> microwave<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.140> coming

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
as you can see our microwave is coming

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.320 
as you can see our microwave is coming
along<00:01:27.680> not<00:01:28.070> creating<00:01:28.490> any<00:01:28.700> problems<00:01:29.150> at<00:01:29.300> all

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
along not creating any problems at all

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.840

for<00:01:29.630> our<00:01:29.660> video<00:01:30.110> streaming<00:01:31.040> perfectly<00:01:31.640> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
for our video streaming perfectly I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.700 
for our video streaming perfectly I
actually<00:01:32.240> have<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.690> computer<00:01:32.960> setup<00:01:33.410> over

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
actually have the computer setup over

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.320 
actually have the computer setup over
here<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.070> I'm<00:01:34.220> watching<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.700> video<00:01:34.940> as<00:01:35.150> I

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
here so I'm watching the video as I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.900 
here so I'm watching the video as I
recorded<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.070> have<00:01:37.190> no<00:01:37.340> problems<00:01:37.790> with

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
recorded and we have no problems with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.470 
recorded and we have no problems with
microwave<00:01:38.360> ovens<00:01:39.880> now<00:01:40.880> what<00:01:41.030> I'm<00:01:41.150> going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.330> do

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
microwave ovens now what I'm going to do

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.200 
microwave ovens now what I'm going to do
is<00:01:41.630> switch<00:01:41.810> over<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.140> an<00:01:42.620> analog<00:01:43.280> 2.4

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
is switch over to an analog 2.4

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.630 
is switch over to an analog 2.4
gigahertz<00:01:44.240> Wireless<00:01:44.960> camera<00:01:45.830> yes<00:01:46.400> they<00:01:46.610> are

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
gigahertz Wireless camera yes they are

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.480 
gigahertz Wireless camera yes they are
considerably<00:01:47.330> smaller<00:01:47.630> however<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:49.070> is

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
considerably smaller however there is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.920 
considerably smaller however there is
considerably<00:01:50.000> simpler<00:01:50.510> in<00:01:50.630> their<00:01:50.750> design

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
considerably simpler in their design

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.750 
considerably simpler in their design
they<00:01:51.380> don't<00:01:51.590> have<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.950> contain<00:01:52.310> any

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
they don't have to contain any

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.420 
they don't have to contain any
digitizing<00:01:53.600> circuitry<00:01:54.020> whatsoever<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.250> let's

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
digitizing circuitry whatsoever so let's

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.830 
digitizing circuitry whatsoever so let's
get<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.700> hooked<00:01:55.910> up<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.360> I'll<00:01:56.540> see<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
get this hooked up and I'll see you in a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.320 
get this hooked up and I'll see you in a
minute<00:02:02.950> ok<00:02:03.950> ladies<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.340> gentlemen<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.270> is
