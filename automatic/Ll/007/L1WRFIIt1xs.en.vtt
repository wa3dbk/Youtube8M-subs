00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi girls then in this tutorial 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.389
 I want to show you an alternative method 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 to close the shirts when work 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's over 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.519
 normally we make one overlap 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.970
 on the other while we are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.760
 working and instead in this method that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 I will show you we will close them with needle e 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.240
 wire 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.960
 it's not like burial a lot 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 simple instead and remains very nice 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.670
 then I leave you then to the video 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.219
 but before leaving you I ask you how 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.899
 I always like to click or not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.930
 like on the video you liked it there is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.559
 liked to comment on it then to get me 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 whether precisely downward or in 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.399
 positive what you think of this by 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.309
 this tutorial and if you have any 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 requests that I can fulfill is 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.510
 surely I will make it perfect at this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.570
 point I greet you and thank you again 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.860
 to all of you who follow me and leave you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.860
 tutorial hi girls 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.540
 ok then now let's go to see the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.270
 alternative method I was talking about for you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.229
 close the job this time with needle 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 and thread and not crossing the stitches like 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.420
 I had already shown in another video 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.970
 then we start with taking the thread 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.680
 at least four times the length of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.829
 our work so that we are safe 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.689
 we talk a lot and cut in a way 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.930
 that we are sure that the thread is there 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.170
 it is used for sewing to close the job 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.479
 is sufficient after that we go to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 take a magician whom I have not prepared 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.409
 of course and so now let's go to 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 look for it together in this in this beautiful 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.140
 so that today we take it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.890
 one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:19.360
 ok i would say this is great 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:22.960
 ok taken this in I put in the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.520
 thread that I cut and kept for 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.620
 run away 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.240
 what i really do is really 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:37.420
 really simple then we enter 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:42.010
 backwards in the first two points and go out 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.580
 with the thread we pull the thread ok now what 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.230
 let's make 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.120
 we enter right into the first point 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.620
 we go out with the thread and we do that 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.090
 we drop the first point and pull 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.790
 now we do them all over again 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 we have done now so it is always 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.940
 this the movement must be done 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.760
 we enter in reverse in the first two points 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.840
 in the two yes in the first 2 points 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 we go out with the thread and pull the thread well 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.780
 then we enter it has right only in the first one 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.440
 that in the first point that we find on the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.040
 iron 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.760
 we pull the thread and do it and we do 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.100
 drop the point from the iron now 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.810
 we enter backwards 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:39.130
 in the other two and we go out with all the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.459
 wire 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.459
 we enter right into the first point 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.790
 we pull the whole thread and let it fall 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 the first point now we still enter 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.590
 backhand in the next two we go out with 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 all the wire 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.700
 then we enter right into the next 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:17.790
 point and we go out with the thread and we do 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:20.730
 drop the first point maybe give it to you 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.100
 a little bit is if it doesn't stay too much 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.690
 soft closing 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.960
 ok now let's go backwards in the first 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.960
 next two then we enter right into the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 first point we go out with the thread e 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 let's drop the first point 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.500
 let's pull a little bit and go to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.980
 take erode the next two we go out 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.980
 with needle and thread 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.900
 pulling you enter right into the first 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.720
 we pull the thread and let fall a 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:06.090
 point we return to the reverse in the next 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:10.320
 2 with lake and we go out with needle and thread 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.710
 from the points we enter right into the lodging 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.750
 at the point in the first point and we go out with 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.570
 needle and thread 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.580
 we pull and throw down the point e 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.580
 let's pull a little bit more then 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.840
 we enter backwards 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.840
 in the next two points 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:37.440
 we go out with a needle and thread, pulling the thread well 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.169
 we enter right into the first thread e 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.980
 we pull we succeed with needle and thread doing 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.900
 falling like this with the help of a finger 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:52.010
 first point and we pull one more 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.010
 little bit ok 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.760
 we enter again in the next two we go out 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.690
 with needle and thread we pull we enter into the 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:08.010
 first right we pull and we do 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.270
 drop the point yet we enter the 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.870
 next 2 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.830
 backwards we go out with needle and thread 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.990
 let's get straight into the first point 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:23.970
 that there is on the iron we go out with needle and thread 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.780
 and let's drop the first point you see 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.610
 this is a somewhat particular closure 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:34.470
 which, however, I also remember a little at the end 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:40.050
 the one we put on the points 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:42.600
 see then it goes on like this you enter 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.740
 in the next two upside down you go out with 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.350
 needle and thread 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.720
 you enter the first point you are entitled yes 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.350
 succeeds with needle and thread and drops the 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.210
 point so it goes on throughout the 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:58.560
 perfect iron girls I would say that 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.310
 this can pay for what it is 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:09.510
 all very repetitive and I hope that too 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:12.300
 you liked this idea and commented on it 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.280
 if you liked the video and click me 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.590
 like it if you liked the video 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.590
 hello girls and the next tutorial
