studio<00:00:07.639> I'm<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:10.070> trying<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> show

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
studio I'm going to be trying to show

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
studio I'm going to be trying to show
how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> draw<00:00:11.759> kind<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> shaded<00:00:13.080> objects

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
how to draw kind of shaded objects

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.799 
how to draw kind of shaded objects
really<00:00:13.860> easily<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.880> program<00:00:15.269> as

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
really easily with this program as

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.150 
really easily with this program as
opposed<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> drawing<00:00:16.619> them<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.039> other

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
opposed to drawing them with some other

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.939 
opposed to drawing them with some other
program<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.320> importing<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.470> because

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
program and then importing them because

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.910 
program and then importing them because
I<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.689> this<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.590> program

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I like to use this you know one program

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
I like to use this you know one program
if<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> great<00:00:24.510> drawing

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
if I can and it's a great drawing

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.060 
if I can and it's a great drawing
program<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.260> there's<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.740> shouldn't<00:00:25.980> be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
program so there's really shouldn't be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.529 
program so there's really shouldn't be
any<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:27.769> yeah<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.699> what

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
any need yeah so on with the show what

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.430 
any need yeah so on with the show what
we're<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.260> doing<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:33.290> here's<00:00:34.290> our

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
we're going to be doing is here's our

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
we're going to be doing is here's our
tool<00:00:34.590> options<00:00:34.980> window<00:00:35.540> if<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.630> go<00:00:36.750> over<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
tool options window if we go over and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
tool options window if we go over and
we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> select<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> circle<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.340> we

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we're going to select a circle and if we

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
we're going to select a circle and if we
look<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> region<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.350> curve

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
look we have a region and a curve

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
look we have a region and a curve
gradient<00:00:41.160> B<00:00:41.399> line<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.600> our<00:00:43.050> tool

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
gradient B line those are our tool

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.660 
gradient B line those are our tool
options<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.920> selected<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.520> that's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
options that are selected and that's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.950 
options that are selected and that's
what<00:00:44.879> we're<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.059> lay<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.750> draw

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
what we're gonna lay down when we draw

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
what we're gonna lay down when we draw
our<00:00:46.739> circle<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.210> here's<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> circle<00:00:48.870> plop<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
our circle so here's the circle plop and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.040 
our circle so here's the circle plop and
look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.670> ads<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> gradient<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.719> just

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
look at ads of that gradient it's just

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
look at ads of that gradient it's just
all<00:00:52.170> over<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.440> place<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.129> select

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
all over the place but if we select

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.740 
all over the place but if we select
those<00:00:54.210> two<00:00:54.270> items<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.870> encapsulate<00:00:55.530> them

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
those two items and encapsulate them

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.610 
those two items and encapsulate them
over<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.109> hand<00:00:58.289> side<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
over on the right hand side of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.060 
over on the right hand side of the
screen<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.250> I<00:01:00.620> don't<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.800> why<00:01:01.920> was

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
screen you can see I don't know why was

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
screen you can see I don't know why was
scrolled<00:01:02.550> over<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:02.969> whatever<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:04.019> take<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
scrolled over well whatever you take the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.960 
scrolled over well whatever you take the
gradient<00:01:04.439> move<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.549> above<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> region<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
gradient move it up above the region of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
gradient move it up above the region of
whatever<00:01:08.970> shape<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.360> doing<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> then

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
whatever shape you're doing and then

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
whatever shape you're doing and then
change<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.400> blend<00:01:11.760> method<00:01:13.220> into<00:01:14.570> straight

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
change the blend method into straight

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
change the blend method into straight
onto<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:18.799> don't<00:01:19.799> believe<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.130> if

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
onto and that's it don't believe me if

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
onto and that's it don't believe me if
you<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> selection<00:01:21.689> tool<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.799> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you take a selection tool and you just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.820 
you take a selection tool and you just
move<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.090> duct<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.110> gradient<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
move the with duct of the gradient and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
move the with duct of the gradient and
they<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:27.869> won't<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.140> anything<00:01:28.409> there's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
they are you won't make anything there's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
they are you won't make anything there's
a<00:01:28.920> sphere<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.610> light<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.630> way<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
a sphere you can light it in any way you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.840 
a sphere you can light it in any way you
want<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> gradient<00:01:32.759> editor

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
want you can go with the gradient editor

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.310 
want you can go with the gradient editor
and<00:01:33.299> change<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.840> course<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.170> whatever

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and change it of course to whatever

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
and change it of course to whatever
color<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.640> gradual<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
color or how gradual you want it and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.060 
color or how gradual you want it and
even<00:01:37.079> move<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> independent<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> shape

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
even move it independent of the shape

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.450 
even move it independent of the shape
and<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> move<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> outside<00:01:39.960> around<00:01:40.460> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and when you move the outside around you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.749 
and when you move the outside around you
yeah<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
yeah so there you go you can make it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.389 
yeah so there you go you can make it
this<00:01:45.240> sort<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> blobby<00:01:45.930> shape<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.399> suppose

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this sort of blobby shape and I suppose

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.620 
this sort of blobby shape and I suppose
that's<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.600> easy<00:01:51.720> enough<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> mix<00:01:52.369> with

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that's it it's easy enough to mix with

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
that's it it's easy enough to mix with
you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.899> layering<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:56.100> top

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you know with layering put them on top

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.980 
you know with layering put them on top
of<00:01:56.549> each<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> make<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.509> complicated

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of each other and make very complicated

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.670 
of each other and make very complicated
shapes<00:01:59.360> that's<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.979> sort<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> it
