00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
here's the escort she was gonna buy but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
here's the escort she was gonna buy but
you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.560> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> tricky<00:01:59.310> stick<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you know it's kind of a tricky stick to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.359 
you know it's kind of a tricky stick to
drive<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> particular<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
drive in this particular one because the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.539 
drive in this particular one because the
bushing<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.060> worn<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.369> six<00:02:05.369> in

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
bushing it was a little worn and six in

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.510 
bushing it was a little worn and six in
fifth

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
fifth

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.669 
fifth
six<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.329> fifth<00:02:07.479> gear<00:02:07.630> because<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.140> fluid<00:02:08.470> is

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
six and fifth gear because the fluid is

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.760 
six and fifth gear because the fluid is
leaking<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.399> low<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:11.319> least<00:02:11.440> that's<00:02:11.680> my

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
leaking it's low so at least that's my

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.600 
leaking it's low so at least that's my
guess<00:02:12.550> I'm<00:02:12.819> not<00:02:12.940> gonna<00:02:13.120> try<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.300> fix<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.720> but

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
guess I'm not gonna try to fix it but

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.250 
guess I'm not gonna try to fix it but
well<00:02:15.610> she's<00:02:15.970> got<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.239> white<00:02:16.420> Buick<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.959> I'm

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
but right there where you see I've got a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.009 
but right there where you see I've got a
little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.209> water<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.510> brie<00:03:01.660> cleaner

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
little bit of water in brie cleaner

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.150 
little bit of water in brie cleaner
because<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.680> doing<00:03:02.799> some<00:03:02.980> other<00:03:03.040> stuff

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
because I was doing some other stuff

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.650 
because I was doing some other stuff
that's<00:03:04.150> where<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.480> saw<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.900> oil<00:03:05.200> leaking<00:03:05.709> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
that's where I saw the oil leaking and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.900 
that's where I saw the oil leaking and
at<00:03:07.660> first<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.049> thought<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.290> oil<00:03:08.500> because<00:03:09.400> I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
at first I thought it was oil because I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.509 
at first I thought it was oil because I
thought<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.540> remembered<00:03:10.660> seeing<00:03:11.109> more<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.739> it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
thought I remembered seeing more in it

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.060 
thought I remembered seeing more in it
when<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:13.030> first<00:03:13.299> started<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:13.930> or<00:03:14.530> before<00:03:14.799> we

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
when we first started it up or before we

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.020 
when we first started it up or before we
first<00:03:15.280> started<00:03:15.609> up<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:18.190> now<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.579> look<00:03:18.820> at

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
first started up but now that I look at

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.160 
first started up but now that I look at
it<00:03:19.180> I'm<00:03:19.359> thinking<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.690> might<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.840> power

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
it I'm thinking it might be power

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.910 
it I'm thinking it might be power
steering<00:03:20.530> fluid<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:23.079> I'm<00:03:23.380> gonna<00:03:23.500> go<00:03:23.680> ahead<00:03:23.709> and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
ground level it out and fire it up and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.900 
her completely forgot to take any more
video<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.200> did<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.829> coolant<00:04:03.160> flush<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.670> I

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
video but I did the coolant flush and I

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.340 
video but I did the coolant flush and I
found<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.239> leak<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.780> turned<00:04:05.019> out<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.260> be

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
found that leak it turned out to be

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.550 
found that leak it turned out to be
power<00:04:05.590> steering<00:04:05.950> fluid<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.959> ended<00:04:08.230> up<00:04:08.319> looking

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
power steering fluid it ended up looking

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.259 
power steering fluid it ended up looking
like<00:04:08.769> oil<00:04:09.160> because<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.700> power<00:04:09.880> steering

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
like oil because the power steering

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.319 
like oil because the power steering
fluid<00:04:10.359> was<00:04:10.660> kind<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.959> falling<00:04:11.590> into<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> trough

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
fluid was kind of falling into a trough

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.000 
fluid was kind of falling into a trough
under<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.450> car<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.959> looked<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.380> her<00:04:14.799> that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
under the car that looked like her that

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.689 
under the car that looked like her that
had<00:04:16.470> basically<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.799> bunch<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.070> dirt<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.489> grime

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
had basically a bunch of dirt and grime

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:19.680 
had basically a bunch of dirt and grime
in<00:04:18.940> it

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
in it

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.100 
in it
and<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:21.190> oil<00:04:21.400> pan<00:04:21.760> was<00:04:22.270> seeping<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.750> little<00:04:22.990> bit

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and the oil pan was seeping a little bit

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.560 
and the oil pan was seeping a little bit
and<00:04:23.290> filled<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.300> course<00:04:25.480> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
and filled that up and of course the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.360 
and filled that up and of course the
power<00:04:25.720> steering<00:04:26.020> with<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.470> fluid<00:04:27.250> was

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
power steering with the fluid was

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.610 
power steering with the fluid was
leaking<00:04:27.640> right<00:04:27.760> above<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.360> hose<00:04:28.540> was<00:04:28.810> so

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
leaking right above that the hose was so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.220 
leaking right above that the hose was so
drip<00:04:30.100> down<00:04:30.280> through<00:04:30.580> all<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.910> crap<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.450> at

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
drip down through all that crap and at

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.680 
drip down through all that crap and at
the<00:04:32.350> bottom<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> power<00:04:32.980> steering<00:04:33.280> fluid

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
the bottom the power steering fluid

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.500 
the bottom the power steering fluid
ended<00:04:34.690> up<00:04:34.810> looking<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.140> oil<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.180> wasn't

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
ended up looking like oil but it wasn't

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.240 
ended up looking like oil but it wasn't
that<00:04:37.570> just<00:04:37.780> power<00:04:37.990> steering<00:04:38.380> fluid<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:38.950> I

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
that just power steering fluid so I I

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.970 
that just power steering fluid so I I
talked<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:39.820> off<00:04:39.940> or<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.650> sent<00:04:41.650> her<00:04:41.710> on<00:04:41.740> her<00:04:41.860> way

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
talked it off or and sent her on her way

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.210 
talked it off or and sent her on her way
told<00:04:42.400> her<00:04:42.490> where<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.760> wasn't<00:04:42.910> how<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.210> fill<00:04:43.420> it

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
told her where it wasn't how to fill it

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.970 
told her where it wasn't how to fill it
and<00:04:45.220> she's<00:04:45.430> gonna<00:04:45.550> come<00:04:45.790> back<00:04:46.710> whenever<00:04:47.710> she

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
gets the money and we're gonna replace

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.330 
gets the money and we're gonna replace
that<00:04:49.150> hose<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:49.900> you'll<00:04:50.620> see<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.950> car<00:04:51.130> again

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
that hose so you'll see the car again

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.020 
that hose so you'll see the car again
needs<00:04:51.610> oil<00:04:51.850> changed<00:04:52.210> too<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:54.130> I've<00:04:54.640> got<00:04:54.850> this

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
needs oil changed too but I've got this

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.890 
needs oil changed too but I've got this
thing<00:04:55.210> in<00:04:55.390> here<00:04:55.540> now<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:58.180> sort<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.480> mocking

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
thing in here now just sort of mocking

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.770 
thing in here now just sort of mocking
up<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.050> exhaust<00:05:00.060> I've<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.240> kind<00:05:01.480> of<00:05:01.510> got<00:05:01.660> it

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
up the exhaust I've just kind of got it

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.930 
up the exhaust I've just kind of got it
hanging<00:05:01.960> there<00:05:02.230> with<00:05:02.350> wire<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.550> can<00:05:03.730> get<00:05:03.850> an

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
hanging there with wire so I can get an

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.490 
hanging there with wire so I can get an
idea<00:05:04.360> how<00:05:05.290> much<00:05:05.440> length<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:06.070> need<00:05:07.080> off<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.380> those

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
idea how much length I need off of those

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.880 
idea how much length I need off of those
end<00:05:08.740> pipes<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:10.690> get<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.900> back<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.650> flange

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
end pipes to get it back to the flange

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.890 
end pipes to get it back to the flange
because<00:05:12.220> they<00:05:12.340> took<00:05:12.490> looks<00:05:13.450> like<00:05:13.600> you<00:05:13.690> took<00:05:13.840> a

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
because they took looks like you took a

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.450 
because they took looks like you took a
torch<00:05:14.200> or<00:05:14.380> plasma<00:05:14.740> cutter<00:05:14.920> or<00:05:15.040> something<00:05:15.310> and

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
torch or plasma cutter or something and

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.800 
torch or plasma cutter or something and
cut<00:05:15.640> those<00:05:15.960> cut<00:05:16.960> those<00:05:17.110> ends<00:05:17.380> off<00:05:18.390> so<00:05:19.390> I'm

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
cut those cut those ends off so I'm

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.900 
cut those cut those ends off so I'm
gonna<00:05:19.930> have<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.170> get<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.320> few<00:05:20.920> adapters<00:05:21.490> and

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
gonna have to get a few adapters and

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.409 
gonna have to get a few adapters and
chunk<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.900> pipe<00:05:23.080> on<00:05:23.290> each<00:05:23.440> side<00:05:24.150> see<00:05:25.150> if<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.300> can

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
chunk a pipe on each side see if I can

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.510 
chunk a pipe on each side see if I can
figure<00:05:25.540> out<00:05:25.660> figure<00:05:26.169> out<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.380> way<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.530> mock<00:05:27.310> it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
figure out figure out a way to mock it

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.640 
figure out figure out a way to mock it
up<00:05:27.990> probably<00:05:28.990> not<00:05:29.110> going<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.350> do<00:05:29.440> any<00:05:29.620> more

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
up probably not going to do any more

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.830 
up probably not going to do any more
filming<00:05:30.100> on<00:05:30.190> this<00:05:30.370> one<00:05:30.630> because<00:05:31.630> we're<00:05:31.750> not

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
filming on this one because we're not

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.540 
filming on this one because we're not
going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.050> put<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.260> together<00:05:32.380> today

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
going to put it together today

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.370 
going to put it together today
I<00:05:33.610> also<00:05:34.150> need<00:05:34.450> hangers<00:05:34.840> because<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.200> looks

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
I also need hangers because it looks

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.470 
I also need hangers because it looks
like<00:05:35.530> they<00:05:35.650> took<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:36.070> knife<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.090> just<00:05:37.180> cut

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
like they took a knife and just cut

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.890 
like they took a knife and just cut
their<00:05:37.690> rubber<00:05:37.900> hangers<00:05:38.320> off<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.730> I'll<00:05:40.540> have<00:05:40.780> to

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
their rubber hangers off so I'll have to

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.960 
their rubber hangers off so I'll have to
figure<00:05:41.110> something<00:05:41.140> out<00:05:41.410> for<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.820> I'm<00:05:42.820> not
