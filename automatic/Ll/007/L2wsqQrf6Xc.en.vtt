00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.430 
out like crazy which is a shame but what
can<00:06:11.790> I<00:06:11.910> do<00:06:11.970> about<00:06:12.060> it<00:06:12.480> so<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:12.930> was<00:06:13.260> really

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
can I do about it so I was really

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.860 
can I do about it so I was really
skeptical<00:06:13.890> about<00:06:14.670> trying<00:06:15.060> this<00:06:15.300> but<00:06:15.840> I

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
skeptical about trying this but I

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.390 
skeptical about trying this but I
actually<00:06:16.110> really<00:06:16.740> really<00:06:16.890> really<00:06:17.220> really

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
actually really really really really

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.930 
actually really really really really
like<00:06:17.760> it<00:06:17.970> even<00:06:18.300> though<00:06:18.420> I<00:06:18.450> have<00:06:18.660> oily<00:06:19.050> skin<00:06:19.080> and

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
like it even though I have oily skin and

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
like it even though I have oily skin and
this<00:06:20.940> can<00:06:21.890> get<00:06:22.890> me<00:06:23.190> looking<00:06:23.790> kind<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.450> oily<00:06:24.930> I

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
this can get me looking kind of oily I

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.870 
this can get me looking kind of oily I
do<00:06:25.200> still<00:06:25.740> really<00:06:25.980> enjoy<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.460> because<00:06:26.580> it

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
do still really enjoy it because it

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.600 
do still really enjoy it because it
feels<00:06:27.120> so<00:06:27.570> lightly<00:06:27.930> on<00:06:28.290> the<00:06:28.410> skin<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:28.710> if<00:06:29.460> I

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
feels so lightly on the skin and if I

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.940 
feels so lightly on the skin and if I
just<00:06:29.820> use<00:06:30.060> like<00:06:30.210> a<00:06:30.420> mattifying<00:06:30.720> primer<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.620> a
