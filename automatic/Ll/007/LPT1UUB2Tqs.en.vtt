that<00:01:59.360> it's<00:01:59.540> sort<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.900> mystery<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.620> that

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
that it's sort of a mystery and that

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.890 
that it's sort of a mystery and that
people<00:02:01.610> when<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.880> guess<00:02:02.150> are<00:02:02.330> usually<00:02:02.659> wrong

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.140 

but<00:02:05.900> on<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> other<00:02:06.140> hand<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:07.330> do<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.170> I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
but on the other hand I do think that I

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.640 
but on the other hand I do think that I
it's<00:02:11.150> great<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.630> appear<00:02:12.020> younger<00:02:12.230> than<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's great to appear younger than you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.060 
it's great to appear younger than you
are<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.450> think<00:02:14.600> there's<00:02:15.470> something<00:02:15.709> about

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.449 

not<00:02:19.070> just<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.489> physical<00:02:19.670> appearance<00:02:20.480> but

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
not just a physical appearance but

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.130 
not just a physical appearance but
another<00:02:22.459> kind<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.390> youthfulness<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.080> I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
another kind of youthfulness that I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.860 
another kind of youthfulness that I
can't<00:02:24.380> really<00:02:24.500> put<00:02:24.709> my<00:02:24.739> finger<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.840> when<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
can't really put my finger on but when I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.110 
can't really put my finger on but when I
think<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.130> pertains<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.730> me<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> think

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
think of it as it pertains to me I think

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.479 
think of it as it pertains to me I think
that<00:02:29.480> I'm<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.170> state<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.709> Arrested

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
that I'm like in a state of Arrested

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.670 
that I'm like in a state of Arrested
Development<00:02:32.420> because<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:35.200> am<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> mature<00:02:36.530> person

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
Development because I am a mature person

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.140 
Development because I am a mature person
and<00:02:38.980> I've<00:02:39.980> been<00:02:40.220> through<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> lot<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.030> I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and I've been through a lot and I know I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.100 
and I've been through a lot and I know I
can<00:02:41.269> handle<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.930> lot<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:43.340> smart<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.239> yet<00:02:45.080> I

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
can handle a lot and I'm smart and yet I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.410 
can handle a lot and I'm smart and yet I
still<00:02:46.959> retain<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.410> very<00:02:49.160> childlike<00:02:49.760> quality

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
still retain this very childlike quality

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.390 
still retain this very childlike quality
which<00:02:50.600> i<00:02:50.870> think<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.140> great<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.650> many<00:02:51.860> ways<00:02:52.130> but

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
which i think is great in many ways but

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.640 
which i think is great in many ways but
sometimes<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.940> bothers<00:02:53.060> me<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.570> people<00:02:53.989> will

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
sometimes it bothers me that people will

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.290 
sometimes it bothers me that people will
know<00:02:54.800> me<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.310> while<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.820> think<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.150> I'm

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
know me for a while and think that I'm

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.080 
know me for a while and think that I'm
really<00:02:56.480> young<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.400> guess<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.790> think<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
really young when I I guess I think of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.520 
really young when I I guess I think of
myself<00:02:59.269> as<00:02:59.570> just<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.110> more<00:03:00.200> mature<00:03:00.410> than

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
myself as just a little more mature than

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.400 
myself as just a little more mature than
that<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.890> don't<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.690> think<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.170> comes

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
that I don't know and I think that comes

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.460 
that I don't know and I think that comes
from<00:03:04.000> sort<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> not<00:03:05.269> knowing<00:03:05.600> where<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.019> fit<00:03:06.290> in

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
from sort of not knowing where I fit in

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.000 
from sort of not knowing where I fit in
and<00:03:06.769> not<00:03:06.950> learning<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:10.070> myself<00:03:10.450> much<00:03:11.450> less

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
and not learning to be myself much less

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.740 
and not learning to be myself much less
assert<00:03:13.010> myself<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.880> know<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.239> in<00:03:17.360> everyday

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
assert myself you know just in everyday

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.330 
assert myself you know just in everyday
interactions<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.560> people<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:19.010> don't<00:03:19.040> know<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
interactions with people I don't know I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.740 
interactions with people I don't know I
just<00:03:19.459> feel<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.850> I'm<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> little<00:03:20.360> far<00:03:20.570> behind

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
just feel like I'm a little far behind

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.509 
just feel like I'm a little far behind
or<00:03:21.260> something<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.890> think<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.340> has

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
or something and I think that has

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.130 
or something and I think that has
something<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:23.030> do<00:03:23.299> with<00:03:23.510> being<00:03:23.720> biracial<00:03:23.959> and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
something to do with being biracial and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.240 
something to do with being biracial and
haven't<00:03:27.140> really<00:03:27.380> fully<00:03:27.530> explored<00:03:28.100> that

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
haven't really fully explored that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.650 
haven't really fully explored that
thought<00:03:28.519> yet<00:03:28.790> because<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.120> don't<00:03:29.299> really<00:03:29.450> know

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
thought yet because I don't really know

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.220 
thought yet because I don't really know
what<00:03:29.810> else<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.200> say<00:03:30.380> about<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:31.900> but<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.079> was

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
what else to say about it but that was

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.690 
what else to say about it but that was
something<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.620> I've<00:03:33.860> been<00:03:33.890> thinking<00:03:34.459> about

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
something that I've been thinking about

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.319 
something that I've been thinking about
has<00:03:36.010> because<00:03:37.010> i<00:03:37.100> was<00:03:37.220> playing<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.579> 15<00:03:37.910> year<00:03:38.150> old

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
has because i was playing a 15 year old

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.819 
has because i was playing a 15 year old
in<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.049> play<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:42.110> i<00:03:42.230> guess<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.560> was<00:03:42.590> almost

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
in this play and i guess it was almost

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.789 
in this play and i guess it was almost
believable<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:43.840> anyway<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:47.470> think<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.650> is

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
believable so anyway I think this is

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.460 
believable so anyway I think this is
going<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.980> be<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.100> really<00:03:49.280> short<00:03:49.579> one<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.989> just

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
going to be a really short one I just

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.789 
going to be a really short one I just
had<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.190> read<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.489> quote<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:54.200> book<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.650> I'm

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
had I read a quote this book that I'm

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.099 
had I read a quote this book that I'm

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
reading it's called new people

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
kind of bothers me that when I get asked

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.280 
kind of bothers me that when I get asked
what<00:05:05.990> are<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:09.190> usually<00:05:10.190> say<00:05:10.690> my<00:05:11.690> mom<00:05:11.930> is

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
what are you I usually say my mom is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.370 
what are you I usually say my mom is
black<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:12.860> my<00:05:12.919> dad<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.250> white<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:14.919> i<00:05:17.380> don't

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
black and my dad is white and i don't

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.710 
black and my dad is white and i don't
know<00:05:18.500> like<00:05:18.740> not<00:05:19.460> everybody<00:05:19.940> has<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.240> carry

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
know like not everybody has to carry

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.010 
know like not everybody has to carry
their<00:05:20.990> parents<00:05:21.440> around<00:05:21.650> with<00:05:21.950> them<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:23.660> sort

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
their parents around with them to sort

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.530 
their parents around with them to sort
of<00:05:24.110> explain<00:05:24.530> themselves<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:26.180> guess<00:05:26.360> that's

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
of explain themselves and I guess that's

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.030 
of explain themselves and I guess that's
a<00:05:26.630> choice<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:27.020> make<00:05:27.200> and<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.440> certainly<00:05:27.650> don't

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
a choice I make and I certainly don't

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.760 
a choice I make and I certainly don't
have<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.030> do<00:05:29.330> that<00:05:29.410> could<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.440> say<00:05:30.710> I'm

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
have to do that could you say I'm

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.650 
have to do that could you say I'm
biracial<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.430> could<00:05:31.640> say<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.850> mix<00:05:32.180> i<00:05:32.300> could<00:05:32.480> say

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
biracial I could say I mix i could say

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.140 
biracial I could say I mix i could say
i'm<00:05:32.750> black<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:32.990> white<00:05:33.260> but<00:05:33.530> i<00:05:34.000> guess<00:05:35.000> the

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
i'm black and white but i guess the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.460 
i'm black and white but i guess the
reason<00:05:35.270> i<00:05:35.480> don't<00:05:35.540> say<00:05:35.900> any<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.169> those<00:05:36.410> things

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
reason i don't say any of those things

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.320 
reason i don't say any of those things
is<00:05:36.980> because<00:05:37.130> i<00:05:37.250> don't<00:05:37.490> think<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.760> matters<00:05:37.940> i

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
is because i don't think it matters i

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.210 
is because i don't think it matters i
think<00:05:38.600> pretty<00:05:38.780> much<00:05:38.900> once<00:05:39.260> i<00:05:39.410> say<00:05:39.650> black<00:05:40.010> and

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
think pretty much once i say black and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.630 
think pretty much once i say black and
white<00:05:40.370> then<00:05:40.970> i<00:05:41.000> get<00:05:41.360> put<00:05:42.260> into<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:43.430> black

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
white then i get put into the black

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.540 
white then i get put into the black
category<00:05:44.560> because<00:05:45.560> as<00:05:45.950> you<00:05:46.070> know<00:05:46.100> i<00:05:46.220> believe

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
category because as you know i believe

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.430 
category because as you know i believe
the<00:05:46.700> one-drop<00:05:46.970> rule<00:05:47.060> is<00:05:47.840> alive<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.140> well<00:05:48.320> in

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
the one-drop rule is alive and well in

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.600
