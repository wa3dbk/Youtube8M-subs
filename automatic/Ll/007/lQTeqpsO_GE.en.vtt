00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.010 
skip past this boring starting bitch
however<00:00:30.849> I<00:00:30.939> will<00:00:31.000> show<00:00:31.329> a<00:00:31.360> bit<00:00:31.509> of<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:31.720> simply

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
however I will show a bit of it simply

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.060 
however I will show a bit of it simply
because<00:00:32.200> it<00:00:32.290> isn't<00:00:32.500> bond<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.410> we've<00:00:38.620> all<00:00:38.740> been

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
because it isn't bond so we've all been

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.860 
because it isn't bond so we've all been
edgy<00:00:39.250> falling<00:00:39.610> through<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.820> air<00:00:39.910> you've<00:00:40.660> got

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
edgy falling through the air you've got

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.750 
edgy falling through the air you've got
to<00:00:40.990> try<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.350> avoid<00:00:41.560> getting<00:00:41.890> killed<00:00:42.250> because

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
to try and avoid getting killed because

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.250 
to try and avoid getting killed because
if<00:00:43.120> you<00:00:43.210> get<00:00:43.360> killed<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:43.780> midair<00:00:43.930> then<00:00:44.200> it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
if you get killed in midair then it

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.450 
if you get killed in midair then it
means<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.470> can't<00:00:44.710> landing<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.250> can't

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
means you can't landing you can't

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.030 
means you can't landing you can't
actually<00:00:45.640> kick<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.000> little<00:00:46.060> ass<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:47.770> side

actually landed as you can see the
screen<00:01:06.100> size<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.369> actually<00:01:06.909> incredibly<00:01:07.540> small

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
screen size is actually incredibly small

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.809 
screen size is actually incredibly small
considering<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.950> size<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.159> your<00:01:09.340> monitor<00:01:09.609> or

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
TV or whatever so I'm actually just

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.649 
TV or whatever so I'm actually just
going<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.710> zoom<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.429> a<00:01:12.460> little<00:01:12.640> bit<00:01:12.759> oh<00:01:12.999> my<00:01:13.509> god

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
and the whole point is that as I see a

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.969 
and the whole point is that as I see a
third-person<00:01:16.179> shooter<00:01:16.780> action<00:01:17.049> should<00:01:17.799> be<00:01:17.859> a

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
third-person shooter action should be a

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.830 
third-person shooter action should be a
type<00:01:18.219> think<00:01:18.490> there's<00:01:18.759> tons<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.450> action

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840

it's<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.340> sections<00:01:33.759> we've<00:01:33.969> got<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.179> figure

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
it's the sections we've got to figure

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.359 
it's the sections we've got to figure
out<00:01:34.479> what<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.840> do<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.259> usually<00:01:36.009> it'd<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.219> fair

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
out what to do it usually it'd be fair

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.309 
out what to do it usually it'd be fair
involves<00:01:36.789> sniping<00:01:37.209> a<00:01:37.270> certain<00:01:37.600> thing<00:01:37.780> which

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
involves sniping a certain thing which

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.410 
involves sniping a certain thing which
yeah<00:01:38.560> it's<00:01:39.009> not<00:01:39.159> right<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.459> more<00:01:39.999> it's<00:01:40.119> pretty

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
yeah it's not right for more it's pretty

the<00:01:50.660> first<00:01:50.870> level<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.200> pretty<00:01:51.350> uneventful<00:01:51.650> for

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the first level is pretty uneventful for

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.230 
the first level is pretty uneventful for
a<00:01:52.160> little<00:01:52.280> bit<00:01:52.430> I'm<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.760> going<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:52.970> put<00:01:53.030> into

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
a little bit I'm just going to put into

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.320 
a little bit I'm just going to put into
one<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.510> little<00:01:53.660> ones<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:56.060> there<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.300> go

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
one of the little ones so there we go

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.700 
one of the little ones so there we go
then<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.720> one<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.050> lower<00:01:57.200> levels<00:01:57.590> this

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
then this one of the lower levels this

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.530 
then this one of the lower levels this
is<00:01:57.860> one<00:01:57.980> of<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.160> really<00:01:58.460> shiny<00:01:58.910> nice-looking

bit because you can tell the games and
all<00:02:02.180> game<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.840> still<00:02:03.080> does<00:02:03.230> actually<00:02:03.380> look

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
this is basically how you do the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.510 
this is basically how you do the
platforming<00:02:36.530> sections<00:02:36.740> you've<00:02:37.220> got<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
platforming sections you've got this

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.800 
platforming sections you've got this
little<00:02:37.670> parachute<00:02:38.150> type<00:02:38.390> thing<00:02:38.630> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
little parachute type thing that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.810 
little parachute type thing that
whenever<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.320> jump<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.310> push<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.610> jump

whenever you jump if you push the jump

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.860 
whenever you jump if you push the jump
button<00:02:40.910> again<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.210> haul<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.600> you'll<00:02:41.780> be

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
button again and haul that you'll be

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.570 
button again and haul that you'll be
able<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.800> comes<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:43.190> handy<00:02:43.340> in

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
able to do that it comes in handy in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.860 
able to do that it comes in handy in
wind<00:02:43.760> tunnels<00:02:43.880> because<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.450> basically<00:02:44.540> means

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
wind tunnels because it basically means

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.560 
wind tunnels because it basically means
you<00:02:45.020> can<00:02:45.170> zoom<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.709> up<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.700> one<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.450> them

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
you can zoom on up but it's one of them

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.910 
you can zoom on up but it's one of them
things<00:02:47.630> which<00:02:48.020> has<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.230> say<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.440> platforming

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
things which has to say the platforming

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.350 
things which has to say the platforming
parts<00:02:49.190> basically<00:02:49.400> after<00:02:49.760> our<00:02:50.000> precision

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
parts basically after our precision

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.460 
from platform to platform at the CM time
that<00:02:55.489> something's<00:02:55.880> coming<00:02:56.180> like<00:02:56.630> forming<00:02:57.350> on
