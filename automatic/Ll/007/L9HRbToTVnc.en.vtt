00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
says here in French so we have a French

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
says here in French so we have a French
in<00:01:44.130> English<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.670> everything<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> pretty<00:01:45.750> much

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
in English but everything is pretty much

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
in English but everything is pretty much
online<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> old<00:01:46.920> manual<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.579> guess<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
online so the old manual I guess is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
online so the old manual I guess is
going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.270> online<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.500> much

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
going to be online there's not that much

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
going to be online there's not that much
we<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.369> talking<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:50.909> four<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.420> pages

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
we are talking about four little pages

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.880 
we are talking about four little pages
and<00:01:53.149> that's<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> guess<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> rise

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and that's all for I guess for the rise

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
and that's all for I guess for the rise
of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> nightmares<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> let's<00:01:57.119> hope<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
of the nightmares and let's hope the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.859
