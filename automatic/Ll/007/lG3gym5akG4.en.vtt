00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.050
 this is going to generate 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 a stir-fry 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.580

 the drug trafficking for this efe quito efe 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.630
 so 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.510
 I will be 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 this base 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.290
 you can remove the onion 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.850
 good punch 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 to watch them fast document abound 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.590

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 so good then after the ball played 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.990

 all are all closed mother 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.350
 I just know that I have quite stable with bipolar disorders 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.520
 I send a greeting 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.550
 and I want to comment that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.140
 the recipe is adela tailor and everything has a lot of variety there are many projects that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.820
 take chile 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.170
 she has a job 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 another step back that they put 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.710
 sweet pepper anecdotes that was correct and also 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 another thing is a huge variety of forest sofrito 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.809
 only the east 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 everyone is like a big sofa 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.689
 a rice can sometimes change 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.079
 in as much the different ways of doing it 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.929
 also enzo pérez 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.149
 a person who adds as famous cakes take off other 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.759
 but the next day it was written 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.859
 Well, here is annoying 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.859
 I want to tell you that this one is called stressed 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.919
 elsewhere non-existent credit berbatov press release conrad

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.929
 popular chacarita

 if you do not find it, do not worry 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:58.469
 I have always said that when we are going to cook something we are missing some of 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.659
 teeth 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.659
 that's not why it's going to stop doing what they're going to do 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.879
 then for me 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.039
 and the general strike 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.039
 a little olive oil 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.349
 so that it shows very well nothing but that down 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.739
 perelmán de ayudante alejandro gómez m are climbing to the camera 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.779
 the oil slick 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.859
 a little of this oil 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.859
 why act 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.329
 but 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.319
 the oil in the park ballot according to the gestapo the right place in dry 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.659
 1004 to the citizens 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.889
 then to circumvent the fence he needs to defend badly he can 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.609
 it was the appiah weapon by asamoah gyan gha of the cgt 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.659
 and we will see it 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.779
 good and here we are 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.779
 biting everything mou a dog goes very well 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.029
 and you can stay 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.089
 Darnell a spatula 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:12.779
 but be very careful, they go down so much because if they can not have 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.389
 an accident 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.810
 after the blender can 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.389
 touch the spatula 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.370
 you could have passed something 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.120
 so be very careful if you use it did not talk or move forward 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.009
 to the bottom 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.729
 and we are going to continue grinding this 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.729
 everything very well we incorporate 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.640
 the weight returns inally here we have a lot of sofrito 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.219
 they can store it in the refrigerator 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.609
 up for a month and then a little more 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.610
 or they can put it in this genre 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.830
 in monkeys 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.020
 make an account in the separation device you 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:08.959
 in commerce they put a classic and that is how they will divide their portions 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.430
 because the tubes are very very small then so if they put it to him ss that 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.099
 in their portions 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.019
 i can not keep hiccup until about four months 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.129
 make an account on the gadget be there where you can impose your project 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.930
 but as I multiseat it quite 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.569
 I'm not going to put a well capped cap on San Gerardo 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:39.839
 so I hope you liked Tuesday zeta 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.439
