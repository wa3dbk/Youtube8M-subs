 true song to text that changes 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.720
 others it's not a love story 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.540
 but at the same time it's a story 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.430
 of love and then at the musical level listed 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.780

 Dummies is the Japanese are building

 also 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.360
 e 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.000
 day 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.590
 ban at the time landed but I want 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.210
 to really say what it is 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.189
 because it's in the past but with 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.800
 who I grew up for me in presale 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:35.629
 humor is where she is nil in 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.080
 number 1 who vote right who vote 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.939
 on the right already it rattles too much it rattles too much 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.439
 the french but we first 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.539
 rattle a lot but it rattles too much and for 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.620
 stuff not necessarily they do not 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.080
 not necessarily worth it when we 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.419
 is never happy it's boring but 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.669
 I put game as French well 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.529
 dark I'm really going into yours too 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.439
 oral too and we do not ask these 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.360
 compressions we are too sure about ourselves 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.490
 to say that we 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.919
 we do not accept criticism either and 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.180
 in short, it's more their age does not 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.520
 move things forward and often we stagnate 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.400
 on a lot of in the field 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.449
 artistic we stagnate a lot and then 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.060
 in others in other things too 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.280
 What sport eg except hand 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.870
 ball except bulu there for the blow there is 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.969
 really the mayor of montreuil er alps 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:24.099
 to what the chorus not founded bad 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:25.659
 bet but will go pack yeah but no 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.560
 I really bounce on what he said 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.879
 since you see we can still do 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.849
 a serious answer 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.650
 we have so many good artists 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.419
 I'm Italian we did so much 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.919
 finally we have so many artists 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.039
 incredible whether it's writers 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.349
 actors were directors 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.039
 musicians and singers 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:46.870
 could really really have exploded 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.330
 and tear everything everywhere and yet that 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.400
 we've been at the forefront at a time too 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.379
 institutions that normally should 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.699
 to be there to help all those people there but 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.889
 finally she's still the same 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.889
 people and that's when grained by 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:02.300
 a crappy lobby and suddenly it benefits 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.610
 it does not benefit new talent 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.590
 water and soap to the elders who have 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.240
 hence anybody their case when 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.009
 she noted sacem and that's cons 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.690
 did exactly it would have to go a little bit 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.020
 further in the experimentation and 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.740
 try new things 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:22.639
 internet is cool for that food 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.120
 is the food really mouth and 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.379
 zidane zidane the food 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.849
 ten thousand times the food but ten thousand 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.919
 times food a certain vision of 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.539
 cinema that no longer exists now but 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.430
 it was still something me 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:36.259
 when you go spielberg who thoroughly 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.370
 truffaut full of great 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.289
 filmmakers who claims to be the 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.780
 new wave and all that we can not we 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:42.790
 do not see him a little pale but at the same 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.950
 time me but 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.690
