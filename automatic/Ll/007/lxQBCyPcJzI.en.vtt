between this game and last game is the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.010 
between this game and last game is the
pega<00:00:03.840> still<00:00:04.259> has<00:00:04.500> both<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.640> his<00:00:06.150> sin<00:00:06.750> was<00:00:06.960> a

pega still has both of his sin was a
nice<00:00:07.259> tight<00:00:07.500> nice<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> little<00:00:08.189> bit<00:00:08.280> late<00:00:08.519> usage

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
nice tight nice a little bit late usage

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.540 
nice tight nice a little bit late usage
of<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.630> flare<00:00:09.840> there<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.679> nice<00:00:10.920> usage<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.429> it

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
of the flare there but nice usage of it

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.860 
of the flare there but nice usage of it
anyway<00:00:11.790> because<00:00:11.940> he<00:00:12.150> really<00:00:12.540> needs<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.809> keep

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
anyway because he really needs to keep

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.330 
anyway because he really needs to keep
those<00:00:13.019> sentinels<00:00:13.349> alive<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.799> game<00:00:13.980> he

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
those sentinels alive this game he

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
those sentinels alive this game he
recognized<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> big<00:00:15.089> issue<00:00:15.269> last<00:00:15.540> game<00:00:15.750> from

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
recognized as a big issue last game from

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.210 
recognized as a big issue last game from
that<00:00:16.080> he<00:00:16.139> didn't<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.500> those<00:00:16.619> sentinels<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that he didn't have those sentinels and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.680 
that he didn't have those sentinels and
tea<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.460> two<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.180> ahead<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.449> up<00:00:18.510> here

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
tea or two to go ahead and up here

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
tea or two to go ahead and up here
rockets<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> go<00:00:19.350> ahead<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> execute<00:00:20.580> his<00:00:20.789> game

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
rockets to go ahead and execute his game

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359 
rockets to go ahead and execute his game
plan<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.359> way<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.600> he<00:00:21.660> wanted<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> i

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
plan the way that he wanted to so i

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
plan the way that he wanted to so i
guess<00:00:23.970> i'd<00:00:24.119> use<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.390> flare<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:24.960> sure<00:00:25.109> that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
guess i'd use this flare make sure that

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
guess i'd use this flare make sure that
the<00:00:25.800> shooters<00:00:26.099> came<00:00:26.279> back<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.910> their<00:00:27.090> range

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the shooters came back that their range

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
the shooters came back that their range
would<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.510> been<00:00:27.599> reduced<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> would<00:00:28.170> not

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
would have been reduced it would not

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.990 
would have been reduced it would not
have<00:00:28.439> been<00:00:28.470> able<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.769> combat<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> sentinel

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
have been able to combat the sentinel

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.080 
have been able to combat the sentinel
successfully<00:00:30.710> yeah<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.550> Chimera

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
successfully yeah so we have the Chimera

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
successfully yeah so we have the Chimera
coming<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.510> right<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.840> looks<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> cat

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

a chin Devils were heading down south to

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.790 
a chin Devils were heading down south to
take<00:00:36.239> care<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.480> victory<00:00:36.899> point<00:00:37.140> once

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

and<00:00:43.260> forcing<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> moonwalking<00:00:44.520> sentinels<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and forcing the moonwalking sentinels to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.510 
and forcing the moonwalking sentinels to
get<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> middle<00:00:46.430> meantime<00:00:47.430> we

end on very well well actually if they
set<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:53.969> closer<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
set up there a little closer this can be

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.660 
set up there a little closer this can be
their<00:00:54.989> issue<00:00:55.140> he<00:00:55.649> doesn't<00:00:55.949> holy<00:00:56.190> hammers<00:00:56.489> not

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
little earlier there but he has killed

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
little earlier there but he has killed
two<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> three<00:01:03.660> models<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> can

two out of the three models if you can
do<00:01:05.070> anything<00:01:05.280> about<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.880> looks<00:01:06.030> like

much<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:12.780> once<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.409> being

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
much about that but once it does being

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
much about that but once it does being
in<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.369> building<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.540> where

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
in that building will be well not where

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
in that building will be well not where
he<00:01:15.750> wants<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> okay<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.950> may<00:01:17.100> be

he wants to be okay that's as may be
Reba<00:01:17.400> Trina<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.909> early<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.360> yeah<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
Reba Trina a little early there yeah I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
Reba Trina a little early there yeah I
think<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.200> saw<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> flanken<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.310> kind

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
think he saw the flanken was just kind

first<00:02:26.460> they<00:02:26.700> are<00:02:26.730> everybody<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.270> our<00:02:27.360> little

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
first they are everybody in our little

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.150 
first they are everybody in our little
fury<00:02:27.900> our<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.500> theory<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.860> about<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
fury our little theory that about the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.130 
fury our little theory that about the
colors<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.510> fact<00:02:30.540> correct<00:02:30.960> I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
colors is not is not in fact correct I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.810 
colors is not is not in fact correct I
guess<00:02:31.290> yeah<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> has<00:02:31.770> sometimes<00:02:32.100> our<00:02:32.520> little

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
guess yeah that has sometimes our little

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.610 
guess yeah that has sometimes our little
colors<00:02:33.210> has<00:02:33.480> something<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
colors has something to do with the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.340 
colors has something to do with the
bottom<00:02:35.160> part<00:02:35.520> yeah<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.960> function<00:02:37.320> of

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
bottom part yeah it's it's a function of

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.320 
bottom part yeah it's it's a function of
which<00:02:37.560> team<00:02:37.830> Iran<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.460> part<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.090> problem

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
which team Iran is part of that problem

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.670 
which team Iran is part of that problem
and<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.720> other<00:02:39.840> part<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.170> its<00:02:40.290> whether<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.620> not

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and the other part of its whether or not

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680 
and the other part of its whether or not
their<00:02:40.890> first<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.490> guess<00:02:41.700> multi<00:02:42.330> lazy<00:02:42.510> jerk

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
their first I guess multi lazy jerk

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.570 
their first I guess multi lazy jerk
going<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.050> middle<00:02:43.140> score<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.100> reversed

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
going up the middle score is reversed

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.180 
going up the middle score is reversed
right<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.150> pega<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.050> three<00:02:46.650> capping<00:02:47.040> right

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
right now so pega is three capping right

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.920 
right now so pega is three capping right
now<00:02:47.340> he<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.580> showing<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.030> his<00:02:48.150> blue<00:02:48.420> at<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> top

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
now he is showing up his blue at the top

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.080 
now he is showing up his blue at the top
yes<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.800> love<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.100> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> odd<00:02:50.580> because<00:02:50.850> i

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
yes I love it's kind of odd because i

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.280 
yes I love it's kind of odd because i
thought<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> peghead<00:02:51.840> been<00:02:52.080> doing<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> pretty

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.720 
thought the peghead been doing a pretty
good<00:02:52.500> job<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.860> victory<00:02:53.190> points<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.610> whole
