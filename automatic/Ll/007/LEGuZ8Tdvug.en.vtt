00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.220 
for 20k 30k sell them up 75 K because he
will<00:04:32.190> be<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.970> Mallis<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.630> FIFA<00:04:33.990> 12

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.590 
will be like the Mallis of FIFA 12
hopefully<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.100> think<00:04:35.490> he<00:04:35.610> will<00:04:35.820> be<00:04:36.300> around

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
hopefully I think he will be around

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.570 
hopefully I think he will be around
about<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.020> kind<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.260> player<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.830> then<00:04:38.370> I'll

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
about that kind of player and then I'll

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.370 
about that kind of player and then I'll
turn<00:04:38.850> five<00:04:39.120> Stas<00:04:39.360> goes<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.810> Saudi<00:04:40.050> League

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
I think it's only him and he a go Souza

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.000 
I think it's only him and he a go Souza
who<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.200> five-star<00:04:43.650> skills<00:04:43.860> themselves
