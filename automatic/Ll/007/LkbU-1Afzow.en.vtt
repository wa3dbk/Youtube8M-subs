00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.730
 let's prepare a delicious chili 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.350
 which we can accompany with potatoes 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:15.590
 we also eat it a lot with empanadas 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.430
 or even to accompany some beans 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.570
 or a sancocho is ingredients division 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.840
 scallions finely chopped fine 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.470
 chopped cilantro and grated tomato these 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.260
 three ingredients in the same proportion 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.100
 half lemon cap one teaspoon 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 chili and here I am using chili pulp 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.520
 but if you do not get it you can do it with 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.010
 the agent but crushes or chops it and 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 you can get the juice out of the we use 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.680
 little because it is very spicy salt at 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.440
 taste and a little water if required 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.310
 about lemon juice let's add 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.310
 the cilantro 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.090
 it is finally vital 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.810
 the long onion 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 tomato 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.549
 and the chili 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 we mix well 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.870
 let's add a little salt 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.609
 and it was somewhat unfair 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.869
 and here at this point if we want to 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.869
 add vinegar or a little water 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.450
 so that we do not have any transit 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.959
 if we want to prepare guacamole to this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.490
 you can add avocado same well 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.680
 crushed or we can do it let's say in 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.360
 the blender or in a processor with 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 all the same ingredients liquefied or 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.700
 macerated and we can also do it with 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.160
 long onion if we prefer this is the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.430
 texture of chili and here is ready to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.430
 eat
