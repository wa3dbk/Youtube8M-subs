that I have to switch here and so he

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330 
that I have to switch here and so he
switches<00:02:03.299> into<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.920> switch

for him I think he forgot so that your

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.990 
for him I think he forgot so that your
speed<00:04:10.440> doesn't<00:04:10.709> kick<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.549> tournament

he<00:04:14.860> megas<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.340> think<00:04:15.610> hoping<00:04:15.940> for<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.150> speed

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
he megas I think hoping for the speed

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.390 
he megas I think hoping for the speed
tie<00:04:16.600> or<00:04:16.900> maybe<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.560> outspeed<00:04:17.919> me<00:04:18.070> because<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.370> am

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
get the speed so he goes back into hairy

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.150 
get the speed so he goes back into hairy
armor<00:04:32.229> here<00:04:32.470> I'm<00:04:32.650> worried<00:04:32.949> about<00:04:32.979> the

armor here I'm worried about the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.860 
armor here I'm worried about the
fake-out<00:04:33.550> I'm<00:04:34.150> worried<00:04:34.419> about<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.630> bullet

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
fake-out I'm worried about the bullet

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.200 
fake-out I'm worried about the bullet
punch<00:04:35.020> cuz<00:04:35.350> both<00:04:35.500> would<00:04:35.560> finish<00:04:35.919> me<00:04:36.010> off<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
punch cuz both would finish me off I

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
actually end up staying in because I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.070 
actually end up staying in because I
would<00:04:39.699> I<00:04:39.729> realized<00:04:40.270> i<00:04:40.360> was<00:04:40.479> going<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.660> switch<00:04:40.900> i

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
would I realized i was going to switch i

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.510 
would I realized i was going to switch i
was<00:04:41.169> gonna<00:04:41.290> switch<00:04:41.500> into<00:04:41.710> schillinger<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.460> I

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
was gonna switch into schillinger and I

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.159 
was gonna switch into schillinger and I
was<00:04:42.699> like<00:04:42.790> oh<00:04:42.910> no<00:04:43.120> wait<00:04:43.330> he's<00:04:43.570> got<00:04:43.750> rocks<00:04:43.960> up

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
was like oh no wait he's got rocks up

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.219 
was like oh no wait he's got rocks up
he's<00:04:44.770> using<00:04:45.310> rocks<00:04:45.520> in<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:47.050> i

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
he's using rocks in and you you if i

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.900 
he's using rocks in and you you if i
switch<00:04:47.500> then<00:04:48.070> this<00:04:48.250> just<00:04:48.460> becomes<00:04:48.639> death

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
switch then this just becomes death

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.820 
switch then this just becomes death
father<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.780> go<00:04:49.990> into<00:04:50.110> Heisenberg<00:04:50.620> here

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
father so I go into Heisenberg here

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.260 
father so I go into Heisenberg here
because<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.100> know<00:04:51.190> Heisenberg<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.760> easily

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
because I know Heisenberg can easily

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.150 
because I know Heisenberg can easily
take<00:04:52.419> out<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.630> hairy<00:04:52.810> armor<00:04:53.139> with<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.620> brave<00:04:53.889> bird

damage to this rotten meat it's gonna do

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.980 
damage to this rotten meat it's gonna do
an<00:05:06.100> absolute<00:05:06.520> ton<00:05:06.639> of<00:05:06.789> damage<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.180> it's<00:05:07.870> gonna

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
an absolute ton of damage and it's gonna

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.600 
an absolute ton of damage and it's gonna
put<00:05:08.320> him<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.560> range<00:05:08.770> where<00:05:09.100> two<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.490> these

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
put him in a range where two of these

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.850 
put him in a range where two of these
would<00:05:09.880> kill<00:05:10.060> him<00:05:10.270> even<00:05:10.930> after<00:05:11.139> leftovers

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
would kill him even after leftovers

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.560 
would kill him even after leftovers
because<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.310> actually<00:05:12.460> rolled<00:05:12.850> min<00:05:13.120> there<00:05:13.360> and

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
because I actually rolled min there and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.409 
because I actually rolled min there and
I<00:05:14.289> only<00:05:14.470> needed<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.889> roll<00:05:15.070> mid<00:05:15.430> for<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.090> second

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
I only needed to roll mid for the second

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.810 
I only needed to roll mid for the second
hit<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:17.110> kill<00:05:17.710> this<00:05:17.860> even<00:05:18.250> off<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.370> leftovers

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
hit to kill this even off the leftovers

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.790 
hit to kill this even off the leftovers
recovery<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.630> he<00:05:19.780> goes<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.139> trick<00:05:20.440> which<00:05:20.650> is

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
recovery so he goes for trick which is

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.080 
recovery so he goes for trick which is
really<00:05:20.950> interesting<00:05:21.430> because<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.760> gives<00:05:21.849> me<00:05:22.060> a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
really interesting because it gives me a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.969 
really interesting because it gives me a
choice<00:05:22.330> scarf<00:05:22.720> now<00:05:23.229> one<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.500> Heisenberg's

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
choice scarf now one of Heisenberg's

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.190 
choice scarf now one of Heisenberg's
biggest<00:05:24.310> weaknesses<00:05:24.760> is<00:05:24.970> his<00:05:25.300> speed<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.870> one

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
biggest weaknesses is his speed and one

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.570 
biggest weaknesses is his speed and one
of<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:26.380> things<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.680> he<00:05:26.830> was<00:05:26.979> really<00:05:27.400> useless

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
of the things that he was really useless

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.330 
of the things that he was really useless
on<00:05:27.910> this<00:05:28.060> team<00:05:28.270> or<00:05:28.479> not<00:05:28.510> useless<00:05:29.260> but<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:30.190> as

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
on this team or not useless but not as

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.710 
on this team or not useless but not as
useful<00:05:30.520> as<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.849> could<00:05:31.000> have<00:05:31.030> been<00:05:31.240> it's

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
useful as it could have been it's

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.240 
useful as it could have been it's
because<00:05:31.960> of<00:05:31.990> his<00:05:32.139> long<00:05:32.320> speed<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.099> was

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
because of his long speed so I was

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.680 
because of his long speed so I was
really<00:05:33.430> happy<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.729> get<00:05:33.940> a<00:05:34.000> choice<00:05:34.150> scarf<00:05:34.510> on

moxie so I got the Moxie attack boost I
am<00:05:44.979> now<00:05:45.280> choice<00:05:45.639> carved<00:05:46.030> into<00:05:46.240> brave<00:05:46.690> bird<00:05:46.930> and
