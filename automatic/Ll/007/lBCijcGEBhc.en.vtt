00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.349 
gets off a little bit once I record
about<00:04:10.019> past<00:04:10.260> five<00:04:10.500> minutes<00:04:10.889> as<00:04:11.069> if<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.000> 60

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
about past five minutes as if it's a 60

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.020 
about past five minutes as if it's a 60
frames<00:04:12.600> per<00:04:12.660> second<00:04:13.139> game<00:04:13.410> then<00:04:14.280> my<00:04:14.670> audio

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
frames per second game then my audio

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.599 
frames per second game then my audio
gets<00:04:15.329> off<00:04:15.569> we're<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.530> 60<00:04:16.919> frames<00:04:17.130> per<00:04:17.220> second

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
gets off we're not 60 frames per second

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.969 
gets off we're not 60 frames per second
but<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.810> records<00:04:19.289> faster<00:04:19.709> than<00:04:19.859> my

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
but if it records faster than my

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.759 
but if it records faster than my
hypercam<00:04:20.580> does<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.180> my

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
hypercam does then my

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.070 
hypercam does then my
Audio<00:04:21.979> kind<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.370> gets<00:04:22.520> off<00:04:22.669> after<00:04:23.360> about<00:04:23.389> five

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
Audio kind of gets off after about five

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.170 
Audio kind of gets off after about five
or<00:04:24.259> six<00:04:24.530> minutes<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.520> I'm<00:04:25.699> probably<00:04:25.910> going<00:04:26.090> to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
or six minutes so I'm probably going to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.890 
or six minutes so I'm probably going to
have<00:04:26.300> like<00:04:26.479> six<00:04:27.259> minute<00:04:28.120> sessions<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.479> guess

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
have like six minute sessions I guess

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.480 
have like six minute sessions I guess
you<00:04:30.020> could<00:04:30.169> call<00:04:30.319> them<00:04:30.470> for<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.009> watch

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
you could call them for you to watch

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.270 
you could call them for you to watch
all<00:04:31.759> right<00:04:31.879> level<00:04:32.120> 22<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:32.539> good<00:04:32.750> enough

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280

I just won't probably want to see as
much<00:05:11.870> as<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.319> because<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.590> mean<00:05:12.800> stuff<00:05:13.250> like

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
much as it because I mean stuff like

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.399 
much as it because I mean stuff like
this<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:13.669> easier<00:05:14.060> for<00:05:14.210> me<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.360> do<00:05:14.599> and<00:05:15.199> I<00:05:15.259> can

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
this is easier for me to do and I can

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:16.990 
this is easier for me to do and I can
upload<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.770> more<00:05:15.889> consistently<00:05:16.490> for<00:05:16.759> you<00:05:16.819> guys

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
more fun doing this in sprite sprites

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.950 
more fun doing this in sprite sprites
aren't<00:05:31.130> as<00:05:31.490> fun<00:05:31.969> as<00:05:32.090> they<00:05:32.180> used<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.479> be<00:05:32.599> for<00:05:32.840> me

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
aren't as fun as they used to be for me

aren't as fun as they used to be for me
this<00:05:33.229> is<00:05:33.380> more<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:34.120> sprites<00:05:35.120> nowadays<00:05:35.539> are

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
this is more like sprites nowadays are

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.529 
this is more like sprites nowadays are
kind<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:36.020> like<00:05:36.199> I<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.699> get<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.029> sprite<00:05:38.330> done

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
kind of like I have to get a sprite done

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.360 
kind of like I have to get a sprite done
for<00:05:38.779> my<00:05:38.870> channel<00:05:39.199> or<00:05:39.740> either<00:05:40.300> I'm<00:05:42.039> gonna<00:05:43.039> maybe

don't don't no no no no all right after
I<00:05:53.840> finished<00:05:54.199> training<00:05:54.560> my<00:05:54.650> climbing<00:05:55.039> I<00:05:55.099> think

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
I finished training my climbing I think

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.469 
I finished training my climbing I think
I<00:05:55.340> might<00:05:55.490> in<00:05:55.639> this<00:05:55.759> video<00:05:56.060> because<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.300> don't

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
I might in this video because I don't

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.689 
I might in this video because I don't
know<00:05:56.539> how<00:05:56.630> long<00:05:56.810> I'm<00:05:56.990> going<00:05:57.289> for<00:05:57.529> I<00:05:57.770> think<00:05:58.580> I've

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
know how long I'm going for I think I've

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.129 
know how long I'm going for I think I've
probably<00:05:58.909> already<00:05:59.150> passed<00:05:59.449> a<00:05:59.599> six-minute

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
probably already passed a six-minute

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.309 
probably already passed a six-minute
