00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 what when on fire 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 it is raining it goes out he dies 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 disassemble with this 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.530
 by team 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.249
 called on these apples to the right set 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.249
 proud 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.320
 This is the place to write not to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.110
 this here we write no one whose 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.040
 head will 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.010
 here no yes this one where showed whose 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.390
 head will they show you somewhere 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 write and here this custom it already 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:46.150
 we write it is yours yours 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:52.890
 any shows armor reach to be 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:56.580
 look is still the same clear 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.540
 so here is the principle armor stand for 2 blocks 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:08.610
 above 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:11.070
 What does all of it as it is already clear 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.950
 the team of course leave the dog not later 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.380
 I would like to show what is very simple 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 teams were inglings new not saved 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.870
 in the chat, that's shorter , so sleep 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.920
 cool rabbit on chicken then 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.050
 sits at the port very stubbornly this one 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.019
 the team will also leave a kitty like that 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.800
 here for spam money so even carry eggs 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.860
 true of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:46.019
 I could not get that egg through the block 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:49.140
 semi-blocks they fail and they are not 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.540
 can run there and next tight 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.910
 zombies don't pay attention I 'll show you 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.170
 alone through the issue i'm just so so 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.260
 I did it here and in the next issue I 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.410
 I'll show you how to do such a thing well 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.480
 i.e. the security camera can do it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.049
 pillar make another but it can 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.260
 beat 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.500
 kick the city type maps or is there a little 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.220
 Jailbreak funny but it works 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.709
 that is, let's say we put the camera here roughly 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.850
 saying we are building a map let's say escape from 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.989
 prisons yes here there is a camera here here 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.360
 Well, the camera in the sense of the lattice Well, where 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.090
 these rivers are sitting here you need to escape and 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.040
 come here down below the block command 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.269
 player test and let's say it writes in chat 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.760
 teleports you back to run type 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.010
 shouting you raw mission failed 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.320
 what is possible in general very very 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.280
 many things come up here and I such 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.170
 a thing very much like fun 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.040
 well yes this will show you how this 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:03.319
 do the following no no why can you see 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.770
 burn and why did I do it and by the way 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.770
 gerycha 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.190
 fig I pressed the lever 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.900
 In short, okay, I'll show you how to do it. 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:28.490
 the next issue of hea voi terek set 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 didn't know ok 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.919
 the video will pick up here so be cured 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.910
 youtube show how to do camera here 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.020
 commands for 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.300
 a little of this little man and for 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.250
 rabbit will smoke in the description on 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.110
