00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:27.539
 we can observe a tree which 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:30.820
 completely composed of maple fingerboard glued 2 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.010
 Hertz Series Pickup mg 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.710
 they are one of a kind passive 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.420
 but while i'm twirling the guitar in my hands you 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.089
 probably already paid attention to this 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 cap and you now you will squeal 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.610
 why are you lying to us here something should 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.070
 be active otherwise what's under this 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 cap and here we pay attention 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.610
 on 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.989
 high frequencies if you mean 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.580
 frequencies and here it is active from 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.390
 him a battery under that mysterious 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.940
 the cap says it is vintage though 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.090
 look like they are vintage but 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.530
 actually vintage written 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.530
 vintage means interns 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.060
 corrugated maple decks and you can 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.720
 watch the waves who have wavy maple 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.190
 and the deck itself is of ordinary maple and wave 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.640
 there is no 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.030
 head here of three trees main 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 part 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 and ears 4 Kalka as possible to find out the spectrum 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.970
 how could you guess the bass from 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 Maple will be quite a lot of all 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.229
 so the spectrum 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.479
 This is a bass for those who damn 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.210
 physical exertion in Moscow therefore 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.539
 if you get yourself a wonderful 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.539
 tool 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.140
 down up and 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.920
 middle exclusively for you all all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 this information and now look 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.670
 but
