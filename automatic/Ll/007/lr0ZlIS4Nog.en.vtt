00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.660
 that I had, I did not find anything 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 do 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 we decided to approach the ministry 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.390
 of education because we started with some 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.489
 school mode contracts start 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 putting my workshop on top of what it was 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.950
 my house in what we were 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.500
 subcontracted we were learning then 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 we come to what is super 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.640
 hiring of the Dominican state and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.640

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.540
 another recently of 27 million 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.729
 pesos a debt fell turret and tables 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.130
 from a patio where he lived coming to me 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.500
 own house the only woman with a workshop 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 It's me who lead men because there's no 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 limitation for a woman she is a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 example for all women we have 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 we have fought now so good at the same time 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.920
 is where he had arrived with his 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.650
 work 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.119
 we have an association of 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.400
 small and medium entrepreneurs 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.320
 furniture is called sofa moments we have 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.350
 I traveled the entire country to integrate 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.530
 workshops so that wealth does not stay 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.340
 as before it stayed in hand 23 already 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.409
 not because management has made the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.390
 governments to give priority to 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.710
 small and medium enterprises and believe in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 small businessmen 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.170
 and the best mother that is the simple fact 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.869
 to get ahead with a family in a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.150
 rich nation but what the other does not 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.450
 has has been for work is a 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.239
 true example I as a welder never 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 that any man 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.660
 If you have a family friend or neighbor 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.150
