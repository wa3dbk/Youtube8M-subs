the actual figure itself Mechagodzilla
1974<00:01:05.240> now<00:01:06.380> like<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.740> other<00:01:08.130> tokyo<00:01:08.700> vinyl

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
hundred percent accurate in fact it's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020 
hundred percent accurate in fact it's
just<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> cartoony<00:01:19.220> caricature<00:01:20.220> childish

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
little guy just give you a 360 kind of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
little guy just give you a 360 kind of
give<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.369> idea<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:38.909> looks

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
give you a good idea of what he looks

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.679 
give you a good idea of what he looks
like<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:40.130> terms<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.430> articulation<00:01:42.210> he<00:01:42.509> has

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like in terms of articulation he has

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
like in terms of articulation he has
five<00:01:42.960> basic<00:01:43.470> points<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.549> arms<00:01:44.880> rotate<00:01:45.030> like

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
five basic points the arms rotate like

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
five basic points the arms rotate like
so<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> legs<00:01:48.570> getting<00:01:48.810> away<00:01:50.030> legs

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so just like that legs getting away legs

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.270 
so just like that legs getting away legs
can<00:01:51.270> rotate<00:01:51.570> 360<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:53.540> can<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.990> head<00:01:55.280> five

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
can rotate 360 as can the head five

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.200 
can rotate 360 as can the head five
basic<00:01:56.759> points<00:01:58.100> waist<00:01:59.100> doesn't<00:01:59.490> rotate<00:01:59.610> unlike

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
basic points waist doesn't rotate unlike

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.959 
basic points waist doesn't rotate unlike
the<00:02:00.450> 6.5<00:02:01.350> inch<00:02:01.590> band<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.430> creation

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the 6.5 inch band I creation

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.420 
the 6.5 inch band I creation
Mechagodzilla<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.979> tail<00:02:05.159> doesn't

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
Mechagodzilla and the tail doesn't

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300 
Mechagodzilla and the tail doesn't
rotate<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> not<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.860> would<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
rotate so not like you would want to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.540 
rotate so not like you would want to
tailor<00:02:08.489> rotate<00:02:08.879> anyway

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
tailor rotate anyway

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.790 
tailor rotate anyway
so<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.910> our<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.630> articulation<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.380> basic

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so in our for articulation it's basic

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.780 
so in our for articulation it's basic
but<00:02:14.070> still<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.660> child's<00:02:16.290> toy<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:17.670> not

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
but still it's a child's toy it's not

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.660 
but still it's a child's toy it's not
really<00:02:18.030> meant<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.660> extravagant<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.370> it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
really meant to be extravagant but it's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.160 
really meant to be extravagant but it's
on<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.860> yeah<00:02:23.630> now<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> paint<00:02:24.930> job

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
on right it is so yeah now the paint job

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.570 
on right it is so yeah now the paint job
is<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.990> well<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.320> guess<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.370> it's

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is really good well I guess it's it's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.260 
is really good well I guess it's it's
simplistic<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:31.200> whole<00:02:31.440> figure<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.270> moult

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
simplistic the whole figure is moult

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390 
simplistic the whole figure is moult
well<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.690> wouldn't<00:02:34.230> say<00:02:34.320> molded<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
well I wouldn't say molded out of the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.690 
well I wouldn't say molded out of the
silver<00:02:35.790> vinyl<00:02:36.120> its<00:02:36.720> most<00:02:36.990> likely<00:02:37.170> just

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
silver vinyl its most likely just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.380 
silver vinyl its most likely just
painted<00:02:38.700> silver<00:02:39.420> I'm<00:02:39.960> not<00:02:40.140> exactly<00:02:40.440> sure

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
painted silver I'm not exactly sure

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
painted silver I'm not exactly sure
knowing<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> entire<00:02:42.959> body<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:43.860> just

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
knowing the entire body really is just

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.430 
knowing the entire body really is just
silver<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.880> mean<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:46.110> aren't<00:02:46.320> any

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
silver I mean there there aren't any

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.890 
silver I mean there there aren't any
darker<00:02:47.220> highlights<00:02:47.700> anywhere<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.660> just

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
darker highlights anywhere it's just

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.870 
darker highlights anywhere it's just
silver<00:02:51.080> unlike<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> suit<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.830> buttons<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
silver unlike the suit the buttons the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.160 
silver unlike the suit the buttons the
knobs<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.330> whatnot<00:02:54.570> on<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.750> front<00:02:54.959> aren't

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
knobs and whatnot on the front aren't

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.250 
knobs and whatnot on the front aren't
colored<00:02:55.500> they're<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:55.920> silver<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:58.140> only

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
colored they're just silver so the only

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.960 
colored they're just silver so the only
other<00:02:58.380> colors<00:02:59.130> are<00:02:59.700> here<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> teeth

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
other colors are here in the teeth

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.199 
other colors are here in the teeth
shockingly<00:03:02.970> enough<00:03:03.150> they're<00:03:03.660> white<00:03:04.760> eyes<00:03:05.760> are

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
shockingly enough they're white eyes are

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.120 
shockingly enough they're white eyes are
metallic<00:03:07.280> gold<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.930> darker<00:03:09.930> gold<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
metallic gold a darker gold and the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.220 
metallic gold a darker gold and the
things<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.640> side<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.820> his<00:03:11.940> head<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.900> sides

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
things on the side of his head the sides

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.960 
things on the side of his head the sides
of<00:03:13.350> his<00:03:13.500> head<00:03:13.530> are<00:03:14.030> red<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.989> they<00:03:16.110> should<00:03:16.320> be

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
of his head are red like they should be

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.390 
of his head are red like they should be
so<00:03:17.970> yeah<00:03:18.120> simplistic<00:03:19.080> paint<00:03:19.739> job<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so yeah simplistic paint job but it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.810 
so yeah simplistic paint job but it
looks<00:03:20.580> good<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.300> accurate<00:03:22.459> not<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:23.700> hundred

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
looks good it's accurate not one hundred

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.550 
looks good it's accurate not one hundred
percent<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.870> enough<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.230> where<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.440> could

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
percent but enough to where you could

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.830 
percent but enough to where you could
say<00:03:25.769> this<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:27.320> 70s<00:03:28.459> Mechagodzilla<00:03:29.840> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
say this is the 70s Mechagodzilla so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.710 
say this is the 70s Mechagodzilla so
yeah<00:03:31.130> anyway<00:03:32.130> let's<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.610> move<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.360> detail

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
yeah anyway let's just move on to detail

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.350 
yeah anyway let's just move on to detail
really<00:03:34.050> quick<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.670> little<00:03:35.850> figure<00:03:36.150> does

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
really quick so this little figure does

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.350 
really quick so this little figure does
have<00:03:36.600> some<00:03:37.350> nice<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:38.489> points<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.030> detail

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
have some nice you know points of detail

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.690 
have some nice you know points of detail
you<00:03:39.630> know<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.080> show<00:03:40.320> like<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.489> whole

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
you know just to show like the whole

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.660 
you know just to show like the whole
body's<00:03:42.060> covered<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.600> bolts<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.230> whatnot<00:03:43.670> like

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
body's covered in bolts and whatnot like

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.490 
body's covered in bolts and whatnot like
a<00:03:44.880> robot<00:03:45.420> would<00:03:45.570> be<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:46.049> like<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
a robot would be in like the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.250 
a robot would be in like the
Mechagodzilla<00:03:47.340> was<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.700> film<00:03:48.170> toes

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.430 

everything's<00:03:52.260> done<00:03:53.180> intricately<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.750> guess

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
everything's done intricately I I guess

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.250 
everything's done intricately I I guess
you<00:03:55.739> could<00:03:55.769> say<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.459> figure<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.140> mean<00:03:58.140> it

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
you could say on this figure I mean it

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.040 
you could say on this figure I mean it
looks<00:03:58.440> good

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.010 

really<00:04:01.950> does<00:04:05.360> spines<00:04:06.360> these<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:06.810> tiny

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
really does spines these little tiny

really does spines these little tiny
spines<00:04:07.500> they're<00:04:07.860> much<00:04:08.220> smaller<00:04:08.400> than

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
spines they're much smaller than

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.760 
spines they're much smaller than
Godzilla's<00:04:09.300> which<00:04:09.660> actually<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.650> was

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
Godzilla's which actually that was

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.330 
Godzilla's which actually that was
accurate<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.280> film<00:04:11.490> anyway<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:13.340> yes

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
accurate in the film anyway so and yes

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.060 
accurate in the film anyway so and yes
Mechagodzilla<00:04:15.150> has<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> little<00:04:15.690> deviant<00:04:16.650> smile

what he looks like if you have the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.880 
what he looks like if you have the
Godzilla<00:05:11.000> Tokyo<00:05:12.000> final<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:12.900> just<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.290> look

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
Godzilla Tokyo final here is just a look

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:22.040 
Godzilla Tokyo final here is just a look
at<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.280> two<00:05:14.430> together<00:05:19.280> yeah<00:05:20.390> in<00:05:21.390> terms<00:05:21.840> of

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
at the two together yeah in terms of

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.010 
at the two together yeah in terms of
mass<00:05:22.380> Godzilla<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.190> huge<00:05:24.180> compared<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.870> mecha

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
mass Godzilla is huge compared to mecha

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.830 
mass Godzilla is huge compared to mecha
godzilla<00:05:25.970> but<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.150> way<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.450> makes<00:05:27.480> sense

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
godzilla but in a way that makes sense

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.700 
godzilla but in a way that makes sense
because<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.350> is<00:05:28.740> showa<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.540> know

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
because this is showa this is you know

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.480 
because this is showa this is you know
millennium<00:05:31.710> basically<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:33.840> makes<00:05:34.020> sense

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
millennium basically and it makes sense

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.790 
millennium basically and it makes sense
but<00:05:35.490> still<00:05:35.760> it's<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.450> nice<00:05:37.080> pair<00:05:37.380> other<00:05:37.680> than

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
but still it's a nice pair other than

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.620 
but still it's a nice pair other than
the<00:05:37.919> fact<00:05:38.070> that<00:05:38.220> Godzilla's<00:05:38.730> taller<00:05:39.330> than

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
the fact that Godzilla's taller than

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.560 
the fact that Godzilla's taller than
Mechagodzilla<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.820> longer<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:41.850> just<00:05:42.360> about

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
Mechagodzilla and longer and just about

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.390 
Mechagodzilla and longer and just about
everything<00:05:43.260> else<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.740> could<00:05:43.890> possibly<00:05:44.070> think

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
everything else you could possibly think

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.310 
everything else you could possibly think
of<00:05:44.900> but<00:05:45.900> still<00:05:46.590> who<00:05:47.070> cares<00:05:47.900> cute<00:05:48.900> little<00:05:48.930> toys

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.370 
to be the 1954 godzilla which I've seen
the<00:06:40.009> prototype<00:06:40.520> of<00:06:40.550> and<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:40.940> looks<00:06:41.090> kind<00:06:41.300> of

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
the prototype of and it looks kind of

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.640 
the prototype of and it looks kind of
dirt<00:06:42.380> bish<00:06:42.590> but<00:06:43.060> and<00:06:44.060> I'll<00:06:44.690> probably<00:06:45.320> get<00:06:45.530> it
