00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really solid metal chassis it doesn't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
really solid metal chassis it doesn't
have<00:01:36.180> braved<00:01:36.450> cable<00:01:36.840> etc<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> know<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
have braved cable etc but you know so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.600 
have braved cable etc but you know so
what<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:39.509> other<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> doesn't<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.610> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
what one other thing it doesn't have is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
what one other thing it doesn't have is
it's<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.360> height<00:01:42.570> height<00:01:43.079> adjustable<00:01:43.560> which

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it's not height height adjustable which

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
it's not height height adjustable which
I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> should<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.549> even<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:45.000> 60

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I think it should have had even at 60

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
I think it should have had even at 60
pounds<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:46.110> even<00:01:46.350> cheap<00:01:46.590> keyboards<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
pounds because even cheap keyboards to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
pounds because even cheap keyboards to
have<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.700> tabs<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> back<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
have the tabs on the back of them to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
have the tabs on the back of them to
adjust<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.470> height<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> point<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
adjust the height but the point of this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
adjust the height but the point of this
video<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.659> let<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> guys<00:01:52.500> hear<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
video really is to let you guys hear the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
video really is to let you guys hear the
difference<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.549> sound<00:01:53.790> between<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.689> carry<00:01:54.960> MX

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
difference in sound between the carry MX

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
difference in sound between the carry MX
blue<00:01:55.500> keys<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> Cherry<00:01:56.369> MX<00:01:56.460> black<00:01:56.909> keys

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
blue keys and the Cherry MX black keys

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.690 
blue keys and the Cherry MX black keys
so<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.719> way<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> mic<00:01:58.979> close<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so one way to do is put the mic close to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
so one way to do is put the mic close to
the<00:01:59.790> keys<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.060> click<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.619> can

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the keys and click them and then you can

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.130 
the keys and click them and then you can
have<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.390> I'll<00:02:03.509> talk<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
have you know and then I'll talk to you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
have you know and then I'll talk to you
about<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> moment<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> bear

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
about it in just a moment if you bear

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.490 
about it in just a moment if you bear
with<00:02:05.399> me

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.710 

so<00:02:14.500> that's<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.130> Razer<00:02:16.030> BlackWidow<00:02:16.300> Ultimate

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
so that's the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020 
so that's the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
you<00:02:17.140> could<00:02:17.260> clearly<00:02:17.560> hear<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:17.980> click<00:02:18.640> as<00:02:18.910> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
you could clearly hear the click as you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.630 
you could clearly hear the click as you
push<00:02:19.239> down<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:28.989> was<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.620> Alt<00:02:30.370> key

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
push down and that one was the Alt key

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.800 
push down and that one was the Alt key
of<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.330> steelseries<00:02:32.050> 6gv2<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:34.420> can't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
of the steelseries 6gv2 now you can't

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.860 
of the steelseries 6gv2 now you can't
feel<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.040> moment<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.239> key<00:02:37.599> switch

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
feel the moment that the key switch

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
feel the moment that the key switch
actually<00:02:38.560> activates<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.549> Cherry<00:02:39.940> MX

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
actually activates on the Cherry MX

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.449 
actually activates on the Cherry MX
black<00:02:40.450> which<00:02:40.780> doesn't<00:02:41.739> really<00:02:41.920> bother<00:02:42.130> me<00:02:42.340> I

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
black which doesn't really bother me I

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.699 
black which doesn't really bother me I
still<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.540> way<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.930> feels<00:02:44.200> when<00:02:44.410> you

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
still like the way it feels when you

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.030 
still like the way it feels when you
type<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.080> feel<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
type on it and the the the feel that the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.729 
type on it and the the the feel that the
buttons<00:02:48.340> give<00:02:48.580> however<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.410> Cherry<00:02:50.680> MX

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
buttons give however the the Cherry MX

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.979 
buttons give however the the Cherry MX
blue<00:02:51.220> keys<00:02:51.580> definitely<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.150> feel<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
blue keys definitely you can feel the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.440 
blue keys definitely you can feel the
point<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.440> which<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.920> switch<00:02:54.250> activates<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.420> I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
point at which the switch activates so I

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.530 
point at which the switch activates so I
hope<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.810> guys<00:02:56.519> gives<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.610> an<00:02:57.760> idea<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
hope that guys gives you an idea of the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.199 
hope that guys gives you an idea of the
difference<00:02:58.870> between<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.680> sound<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
difference between the sound that a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.270 
difference between the sound that a
cherry<00:03:01.569> MX<00:03:01.690> blue<00:03:01.930> keyboard<00:03:02.110> will<00:03:02.680> make<00:03:02.860> versus

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
cherry MX blue keyboard will make versus

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.190 
cherry MX blue keyboard will make versus
a<00:03:03.459> 2x<00:03:03.880> black<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.299> whether<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.840> would<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.019> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
a 2x black and whether that would be a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.380 
a 2x black and whether that would be a
big<00:03:05.470> deal<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:06.069> or<00:03:06.280> not<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.299> just
