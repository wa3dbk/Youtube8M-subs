make<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.539> instead<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.380> just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
make it the same so instead of just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.049 
make it the same so instead of just
making<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:32.040> Freddy's<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.520> thought<00:00:32.700> I'll<00:00:32.880> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
making two Freddy's I thought I'll just

make a golden Freddy was working mouth
now<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.610> added<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> few<00:00:36.120> wires<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> stuff

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
now I just added a few wires and stuff

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
now I just added a few wires and stuff
popping<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> him<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
popping out of him and a little bit of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
popping out of him and a little bit of
damage<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.329> turned<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.960> great<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
damage which turned out really great in

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
damage which turned out really great in
my<00:00:40.500> opinion<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:41.850> painted

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
my opinion this was actually painted

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.779 
said a few times and a few videos that I
wanted<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.469> some<00:00:46.649> new<00:00:46.680> paints<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> I

damage it's very dirty figure and I was
just<00:01:26.670> playing<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just playing around with it and I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
just playing around with it and I
decided<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> bonnie<00:01:29.220> head<00:01:29.430> rather

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
decided to use the bonnie head rather

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.069 
decided to use the bonnie head rather
than<00:01:29.759> make<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.180> Bonnie's<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.869> thing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
than make two Bonnie's the same thing

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
than make two Bonnie's the same thing
with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> golden<00:01:31.950> Freddy<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> made<00:01:32.700> these

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
with the golden Freddy when I made these

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.090 
with the golden Freddy when I made these
I<00:01:33.240> had<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:33.960> Freddy<00:01:34.290> heads<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> had<00:01:34.920> two

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I had two Freddy heads and I had two

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
I had two Freddy heads and I had two
bonnie<00:01:35.400> heads<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> thought<00:01:36.060> well<00:01:36.659> instead

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
bonnie heads and I thought well instead

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
bonnie heads and I thought well instead
of<00:01:37.320> instead<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.159> making<00:01:38.369> two<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> same

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
of instead of just making two the same

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.690 
of instead of just making two the same
figure<00:01:39.150> I'll<00:01:39.360> make<00:01:39.840> variations<00:01:40.369> now<00:01:41.369> one

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
figure I'll make variations now one

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
figure I'll make variations now one
thing<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.150> managed<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
thing I actually managed to do when I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
thing I actually managed to do when I
made<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.409> new<00:01:43.619> batch<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> figures<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
made this new batch of figures is I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.010 
made this new batch of figures is I
figured<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> better<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> ears

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
figured out a better way to do the ears

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020 
figured out a better way to do the ears
on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> bunny<00:01:46.590> rabbit<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.520> opinion<00:01:47.640> if

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
on the bunny rabbit see in my opinion if

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
on the bunny rabbit see in my opinion if
you<00:01:48.119> compare<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:48.630> together<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.259> ears<00:01:49.560> on

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you compare these together the ears on

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.200 
you compare these together the ears on
the<00:01:49.950> spring-trap<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> normal<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the spring-trap and the normal and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.490 
the spring-trap and the normal and
Bonnie<00:01:51.360> figure<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.290> better

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
Bonnie figure are actually much better

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
Bonnie figure are actually much better
than<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> first<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> did<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.909> just

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
than the first one I did but I just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
than the first one I did but I just
comes<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.570> practice<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.619> spring-trap<00:01:56.159> was

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
comes with practice now spring-trap was

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.560 
comes with practice now spring-trap was
the<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.640> figure<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.969> had<00:01:57.119> tried<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the first figure I had tried to do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
the first figure I had tried to do
damage<00:01:57.840> effects<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.649> stuff<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.369> gave

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
damage effects on and stuff so it gave

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
damage effects on and stuff so it gave
me<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.850> idea<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
me some idea what to do now if you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.109 
me some idea what to do now if you
actually<00:02:01.380> compare<00:02:01.890> him<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.219> foxy<00:02:02.759> over<00:02:03.000> here

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
actually compare him to a foxy over here

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.730 
actually compare him to a foxy over here
you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> fox's<00:02:04.079> damage<00:02:04.350> effects

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you can see the fox's damage effects

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.840 
you can see the fox's damage effects
actually<00:02:05.040> look<00:02:05.189> quite<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> bit<00:02:05.700> better

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
actually look quite a bit better

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
actually look quite a bit better
especially<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> torso<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> look

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
especially on the torso but if you look

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
especially on the torso but if you look
at<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> scar<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.849> top<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.149> his<00:02:09.239> torso<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
at the scar on the top of his torso and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
at the scar on the top of his torso and
especially<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.349> damage<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> middle<00:02:11.160> now

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
especially the damage in the middle now

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.220 
especially the damage in the middle now
that's<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> second<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.170> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's because it was the second time I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's because it was the second time I
did

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
did

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
did
damage<00:02:13.859> effects<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.489> obviously<00:02:15.090> I'd<00:02:15.239> gotten

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
damage effects and obviously I'd gotten

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.880 
damage effects and obviously I'd gotten
much<00:02:15.659> better<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> make<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> proper

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
much better so when I make a proper

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.349 
much better so when I make a proper
spring-trap<00:02:17.400> figure<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.849> know<00:02:17.969> with<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
spring-trap figure you know with the

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.809 
spring-trap figure you know with the
proper<00:02:18.900> face<00:02:19.109> and<00:02:19.379> everything<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.579> do<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
proper face and everything I can do the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.729 
proper face and everything I can do the
damage<00:02:21.000> effects<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.659> better<00:02:21.840> I'll<00:02:22.469> turn

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
damage effects a bit better I'll turn

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.789 
damage effects a bit better I'll turn
them<00:02:22.829> around<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.310> well<00:02:23.519> but<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.709> I'm

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
them around as well but I don't know I'm

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:26.839 
them around as well but I don't know I'm
still<00:02:25.950> pretty<00:02:26.250> happy<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.609> way<00:02:26.640> they

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
still pretty happy with the way they

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.270 
still pretty happy with the way they
both<00:02:27.000> turned<00:02:27.239> out<00:02:27.480> foxy<00:02:28.500> was<00:02:28.799> quite<00:02:29.040> fun<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
both turned out foxy was quite fun to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.699 
both turned out foxy was quite fun to
make<00:02:29.549> at<00:02:29.819> first<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.239> had<00:02:30.359> no<00:02:30.420> idea<00:02:30.959> all<00:02:31.469> how<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
make at first I had no idea all how I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.069 
make at first I had no idea all how I
was<00:02:31.950> gonna<00:02:32.099> scold<00:02:32.430> his<00:02:32.579> face<00:02:32.819> now<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.989> a

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
was gonna scold his face now it's a

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.479 
was gonna scold his face now it's a
little<00:02:34.319> squashed<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.859> you<00:02:34.980> look<00:02:35.099> at<00:02:35.219> the<00:02:35.280> side

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
little squashed if you look at the side

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.160 
little squashed if you look at the side
his<00:02:35.760> snout<00:02:36.000> should<00:02:36.299> be<00:02:36.420> sticking<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.870> quite<00:02:37.139> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
his snout should be sticking out quite a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
his snout should be sticking out quite a
bit<00:02:37.409> more<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.859> this<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.549> first<00:02:38.579> attempt

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
bit more but this was the first attempt

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.759 
bit more but this was the first attempt
so<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.420> pretty<00:02:39.540> happy<00:02:39.689> with<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.409> didn't

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
so I'm pretty happy with it I didn't

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.410 
so I'm pretty happy with it I didn't
actually<00:02:40.889> have<00:02:41.159> any<00:02:41.219> Lego<00:02:41.549> hook<00:02:41.849> hands<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.359> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
actually have any Lego hook hands so I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.849 
actually have any Lego hook hands so I
just<00:02:42.629> made<00:02:42.780> my<00:02:42.959> own<00:02:42.989> out<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.379> clay<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.769> it

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
just made my own out of clay and it

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.589 
just made my own out of clay and it
turned<00:02:44.069> out<00:02:44.219> pretty<00:02:44.430> well<00:02:44.579> it's<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.450> bit

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
turned out pretty well it's just a bit

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.809 
turned out pretty well it's just a bit
soft<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.079> all<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.010> pumps<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.549> really

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
soft is all now the pumps are really

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.369 
soft is all now the pumps are really
easy<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.359> just<00:02:48.450> sawed<00:02:48.810> off<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.139> bottom

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
easy to do I just sawed off the bottom

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.770 
easy to do I just sawed off the bottom
half<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> little<00:02:49.950> legs<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.609> stuck<00:02:51.599> some

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
half a little legs and then stuck some

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.240 
half a little legs and then stuck some
skeleton<00:02:52.230> feet<00:02:52.439> in<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.859> painted<00:02:53.129> them

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
skeleton feet in there and painted them

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.280 
skeleton feet in there and painted them
up<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.639> didn't<00:02:54.389> actually<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.109> figure

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
up I didn't actually like this figure

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.649 
up I didn't actually like this figure
until<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.680> finished<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.450> Fox<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.599> a

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
until I finished it because Fox is a

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.000 
until I finished it because Fox is a
different<00:02:58.049> shape<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.530> rest<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.859> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
different shape to the rest of the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.530 
different shape to the rest of the
characters<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.639> game<00:02:59.669> they're<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.239> quite

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
characters in the game they're all quite

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.149 
characters in the game they're all quite
they're<00:03:01.109> all<00:03:01.200> quite<00:03:01.409> chubby<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:01.950> know

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
they're all quite chubby you know

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.490 
they're all quite chubby you know
they're<00:03:02.340> all<00:03:02.430> big<00:03:02.849> big<00:03:03.689> characters<00:03:04.260> big

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
they're all big big characters big

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.170 
they're all big big characters big
cuddly<00:03:05.129> characters<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.669> then<00:03:05.760> he's<00:03:05.909> quite

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
cuddly characters and then he's quite

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.420 
cuddly characters and then he's quite
skinny<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.439> I<00:03:07.469> was<00:03:07.650> making<00:03:07.859> him<00:03:08.159> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
skinny so when I was making him and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.129 
skinny so when I was making him and
especially<00:03:08.909> with<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> Lego<00:03:09.480> bodies<00:03:09.900> he

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
especially with the Lego bodies he

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.270 
especially with the Lego bodies he
looked<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:10.469> he<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.919> be<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.099> same

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
looked like he was going to be the same

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.979 
looked like he was going to be the same
size<00:03:11.579> which<00:03:11.939> is<00:03:12.090> why<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.269> actually<00:03:12.510> did<00:03:12.870> his

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
size which is why I actually did his

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.140 
size which is why I actually did his
arms<00:03:13.319> different<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:13.919> all<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.579> live<00:03:14.730> ones<00:03:15.000> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
arms different on all of live ones I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.089 
arms different on all of live ones I
sculpted<00:03:15.569> up<00:03:15.719> the<00:03:15.840> arm<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.469> on<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.709> one

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
sculpted up the arm so I was on this one

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.800 
sculpted up the arm so I was on this one
they<00:03:17.370> were<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:17.699> standard<00:03:18.060> Lego<00:03:18.269> arms<00:03:18.690> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
they were just standard Lego arms and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.289 
they were just standard Lego arms and
then<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.989> filed<00:03:19.290> them<00:03:19.530> down<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.120> used<00:03:21.120> my

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
then I filed them down I used my

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.180 
then I filed them down I used my
electric<00:03:21.659> file<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.109> filed<00:03:22.379> two<00:03:22.680> crevasses

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
electric file just filed two crevasses

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.250 
electric file just filed two crevasses
out<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.790> was<00:03:23.879> like<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.449> was<00:03:24.479> bits<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.959> his

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
out so it was like there was bits of his

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.899 
out so it was like there was bits of his
fur<00:03:25.769> missing<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.489> could<00:03:26.639> see<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
fur missing so you could see the

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.849 
fur missing so you could see the
underneath<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.449> skeleton<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.169> overall

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
underneath of the skeleton but overall

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.229 
underneath of the skeleton but overall
I'm<00:03:29.069> pretty<00:03:29.189> happy<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.639> how<00:03:29.729> it<00:03:29.879> turned<00:03:29.909> out

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.179 
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out
I'll<00:03:30.449> just<00:03:30.659> change<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.379> snout<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.919> next

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.800 
I'll just change the snout on the next
one<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:33.180> should<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:33.419> pretty<00:03:33.629> much<00:03:33.720> perfect

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
one and it should be pretty much perfect

head<00:04:09.780> where<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.019> mouth<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.530> hanging<00:04:10.709> down

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
head where the mouth is hanging down

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.249 
head where the mouth is hanging down
like<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.430> supposed<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.849> be<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.079> was

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
like it's supposed to be but I was

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.839 
like it's supposed to be but I was
really<00:04:13.500> happy<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.799> whaler<00:04:14.159> new<00:04:14.370> paint<00:04:14.639> turned

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
really happy to whaler new paint turned

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.699 
really happy to whaler new paint turned
out<00:04:15.030> on<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.269> one<00:04:15.419> that<00:04:15.540> was<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:16.019> think<00:04:16.590> that

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
out on that one that was I think that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.039 
out on that one that was I think that
was<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:16.829> two<00:04:17.190> layers<00:04:17.430> one<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> little

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
was just two layers one with a little

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.360 
was just two layers one with a little
bit<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.259> black<00:04:19.409> in<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.190> make<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
bit of black in it just to make it

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.039 
bit of black in it just to make it
darker<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:20.909> then<00:04:21.120> i<00:04:21.180> drybrush<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.719> lighter

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
darker and then i drybrush the lighter

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.659 
darker and then i drybrush the lighter
one<00:04:22.260> over<00:04:22.469> the<00:04:22.529> top<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.919> was<00:04:23.099> really<00:04:23.370> happy<00:04:23.520> with

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
one over the top I was really happy with

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.219 
one over the top I was really happy with
the<00:04:23.760> way<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:24.029> golden<00:04:24.599> Freddy<00:04:24.840> turned<00:04:25.050> out

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
the way the golden Freddy turned out

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.110 
the way the golden Freddy turned out
look<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.529> that<00:04:25.620> was<00:04:25.740> using<00:04:26.070> my<00:04:26.159> new<00:04:26.279> paint<00:04:26.580> like

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
look so that was using my new paint like

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.930 
look so that was using my new paint like
the<00:04:27.360> yellow<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.810> had<00:04:28.110> before<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.830> was<00:04:28.940> rubbish

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
the yellow I had before it was rubbish

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.580 
the yellow I had before it was rubbish
it<00:04:30.060> just<00:04:30.240> didn't<00:04:30.480> cover<00:04:30.660> anything<00:04:30.990> at<00:04:31.260> all<00:04:31.290> it

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
it just didn't cover anything at all it

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.770 
it just didn't cover anything at all it
was<00:04:31.680> really<00:04:31.949> translucent<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:32.940> if<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.510> made<00:04:33.720> a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
was really translucent but if I made a

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.540 
was really translucent but if I made a
proper<00:04:34.080> golden<00:04:34.380> bunny<00:04:34.560> I'd<00:04:34.740> probably<00:04:34.949> sculpt

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
proper golden bunny I'd probably sculpt

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.700 
proper golden bunny I'd probably sculpt
up<00:04:35.669> her<00:04:35.910> middle<00:04:36.600> because<00:04:36.810> she<00:04:37.080> has<00:04:37.199> like<00:04:37.229> AG

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
up her middle because she has like AG

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.870 
up her middle because she has like AG
she<00:04:37.949> compared<00:04:38.280> them<00:04:38.460> both

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
she compared them both

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.000 
she compared them both
I<00:04:38.910> left<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.750> front<00:04:40.110> piece<00:04:40.320> completely<00:04:40.680> off

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
I left the front piece completely off

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.909 
I left the front piece completely off
but<00:04:41.280> if<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.490> sculpt<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.910> up<00:04:42.080> got<00:04:43.080> custom<00:04:43.530> golden

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
but if I sculpt it up got custom golden

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.650 
but if I sculpt it up got custom golden
Bonnie<00:04:44.100> figure<00:04:44.550> I'd<00:04:44.699> probably<00:04:45.000> give<00:04:45.479> her<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
Bonnie figure I'd probably give her the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.960 
Bonnie figure I'd probably give her the
bowtie<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.260> stuff<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.740> then<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:47.100> might<00:04:47.760> make

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
bowtie and stuff and then I might make

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.520 
bowtie and stuff and then I might make
them<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.449> put<00:04:48.870> them<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.110> another<00:04:49.229> video

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
them and I put them in another video

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.080 
them and I put them in another video
I'll<00:04:49.770> make<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.010> golden<00:04:50.580> Bonnie<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.000> a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
I'll make a golden Bonnie and a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.939 
I'll make a golden Bonnie and a
spring-trap<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:51.960> compare<00:04:52.620> them<00:04:52.770> both

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
spring-trap so you can compare them both

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.310 
spring-trap so you can compare them both
together<00:04:53.130> see<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.060> differences<00:04:54.600> but<00:04:54.870> but

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
together see the differences but but

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.469 
together see the differences but but
we'll<00:04:55.620> see<00:04:55.889> we'll<00:04:56.340> see<00:04:56.370> I've<00:04:56.820> got<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> lot<00:04:57.449> of
