some<00:00:21.510> resin<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> trunk<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> white

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
some resin from the trunk of a white

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.360 
some resin from the trunk of a white
pine<00:00:23.279> tree

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.940 

next<00:00:31.120> he<00:00:31.210> takes<00:00:31.450> hardware<00:00:31.870> -<00:00:31.990> from<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.320> fire<00:00:32.619> and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
next he takes hardware - from a fire and

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.460 
next he takes hardware - from a fire and
grinds<00:00:33.340> it<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.580> powder<00:00:36.960> taking<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.080> resin

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
grinds it to a powder taking the resin

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.010 
grinds it to a powder taking the resin
he<00:00:38.830> put<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.160> into<00:00:39.400> a<00:00:39.430> can<00:00:39.790> that<00:00:40.330> he<00:00:40.480> uses<00:00:40.840> for

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
he put it into a can that he uses for

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.590 
he put it into a can that he uses for
carrying<00:00:41.440> dry<00:00:41.710> tinder<00:00:44.790> any<00:00:45.790> heat<00:00:46.120> source<00:00:46.360> will

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
carrying dry tinder any heat source will

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.430 
carrying dry tinder any heat source will
do<00:00:46.840> in<00:00:47.080> this<00:00:47.800> case<00:00:48.040> he<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.309> using<00:00:48.610> matches<00:00:49.440> yeah

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
do in this case he is using matches yeah

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.600 
do in this case he is using matches yeah
you<00:00:50.770> get<00:00:50.920> getting<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.430> melting<00:00:51.930> yeah<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
you get getting it melting yeah it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.790 
you get getting it melting yeah it
continues<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.360> heat<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.690> resin<00:00:56.140> until<00:00:56.680> it

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
continues to heat the resin until it

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.070 
continues to heat the resin until it
begins<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.309> melt<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.760> Bobble<00:00:59.100> awesome<00:01:01.080> there

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
begins to melt and Bobble awesome there

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.950 
begins to melt and Bobble awesome there
we<00:01:02.230> go<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.860> get<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:05.350> good

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we go you get that that's good

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010 
we go you get that that's good
once<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.259> soft<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:09.850> stirs<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.360> around<00:01:10.690> and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
once it is soft he stirs it around and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.230 
once it is soft he stirs it around and
then<00:01:11.530> adds<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.920> powdered<00:01:12.430> ash

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.330 

he<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.450> uses<00:01:21.659> his<00:01:21.960> glue<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.440> secure<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> Flint

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
he then uses his glue to secure a Flint

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.210 
he then uses his glue to secure a Flint
Arrowhead<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.240> shaft<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.810> his<00:01:24.900> arrow

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.460 

it's<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.580> clue

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.380 

once<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.620> spread<00:01:40.890> evenly<00:01:41.220> he<00:01:41.790> holds<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> over<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
once it spread evenly he holds it over a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.360 
once it spread evenly he holds it over a
flame<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.960> even<00:01:43.230> out<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> finish<00:01:49.310> after<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
flame to even out the finish after a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.370 
flame to even out the finish after a
little<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.670> spreading<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.720> job<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> done

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
little more spreading the job is done

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.290 
little more spreading the job is done
and<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:53.280> arrowhead<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> complete<00:01:55.970> after<00:01:56.970> a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
and the arrowhead is complete after a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900 
and the arrowhead is complete after a
while<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.080> glue<00:01:58.290> hardens<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.040> finish<00:01:59.400> very

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
while the glue hardens to a finish very

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.870 
while the glue hardens to a finish very
similar<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.570> epoxy
