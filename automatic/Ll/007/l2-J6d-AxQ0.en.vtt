some<00:00:16.920> things<00:00:17.100> Edgar<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> basically<00:00:18.600> agreed

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
some things Edgar and I basically agreed

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.540 
some things Edgar and I basically agreed
upon<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.770> most<00:00:19.920> important<00:00:20.310> thing<00:00:20.460> during

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
upon the most important thing during

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.179 
upon the most important thing during
this<00:00:20.760> stroke<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:23.039> you're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
this stroke I think it's like if you're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.950 
this stroke I think it's like if you're
able<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> punch<00:00:23.910> sort<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:25.789> or<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.750> body

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
able to punch sort of up or your body

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
able to punch sort of up or your body
mechanics<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.500> fall<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:28.890> place<00:00:29.160> because

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
mechanics would fall into place because

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
mechanics would fall into place because
the<00:00:29.910> only<00:00:30.269> comment<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.689> had<00:00:30.869> about<00:00:31.050> watching

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
you do it was oh do you like you look
like<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.190> punching<00:00:35.730> straight<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
like you're punching straight but you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420 
like you're punching straight but you
were<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.930> bit<00:00:37.170> lean<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.340> I'd

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
were a little bit lean back so I'd

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
were a little bit lean back so I'd
rather<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> punched<00:00:39.300> littler<00:00:39.780> but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
rather have you punched littler but

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
rather have you punched littler but
sneakier<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.640> through<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.940> eyebrows

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
sneakier right through your eyebrows

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.740 
sneakier right through your eyebrows

that's<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> quintessence

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that's because this is the quintessence

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
that's because this is the quintessence
