it's<00:00:02.419> been<00:00:02.540> a<00:00:02.570> little<00:00:02.719> bit<00:00:02.899> of<00:00:02.959> a<00:00:03.050> while<00:00:03.229> since

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:03.469 
it's been a little bit of a while since

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.920 
it's been a little bit of a while since
I've<00:00:03.739> done<00:00:04.250> an<00:00:04.339> update<00:00:04.640> for<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:04.850> car<00:00:05.120> today

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
I've done an update for this car today

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.059 
I've done an update for this car today
I'm<00:00:06.080> going<00:00:06.200> to<00:00:06.290> be<00:00:06.379> trying<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:06.770> get<00:00:06.890> the

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
I'm going to be trying to get the

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.360 
I'm going to be trying to get the
integral<00:00:07.700> of<00:00:07.850> set<00:00:08.029> up<00:00:08.240> one<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.130> then<00:00:10.130> you<00:00:10.219> use

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
integral of set up one so then you use

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.629 
integral of set up one so then you use
the<00:00:10.580> existing<00:00:11.259> intercooler<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.160> custom-made

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
the existing intercooler the custom-made

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.929 
the existing intercooler the custom-made
one<00:00:13.790> up<00:00:13.910> maybe<00:00:14.360> two<00:00:14.719> three<00:00:14.929> I've<00:00:15.379> got<00:00:15.530> the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:15.939 
one up maybe two three I've got the

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.500 
one up maybe two three I've got the
intercooler<00:00:16.939> here

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
intercooler here

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.570 
intercooler here
it's<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.590> thick<00:00:18.830> core<00:00:19.100> one<00:00:19.279> no<00:00:19.460> so<00:00:19.730> looking<00:00:20.480> at

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
it's the thick core one no so looking at

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.550 
it's the thick core one no so looking at
this<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.800> space<00:00:24.800> I've<00:00:25.279> got<00:00:25.460> in<00:00:25.640> there

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
this and the space I've got in there

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.630 
this and the space I've got in there
I've<00:00:27.560> taken<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:27.980> front<00:00:28.189> section<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
I've taken of a front section of the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.750 
I've taken of a front section of the
bumper<00:00:31.060> I've<00:00:32.060> got<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.540> thick<00:00:32.870> or

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
bumper I've got this thick or

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.570 
bumper I've got this thick or
intercooler<00:00:34.760> which<00:00:34.910> is<00:00:36.250> pretty<00:00:37.250> much<00:00:37.370> the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
intercooler which is pretty much the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.930 
intercooler which is pretty much the
width<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:39.170> sleeves<00:00:39.470> will<00:00:39.740> hang<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.610> effect

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
width of the sleeves will hang in effect

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.370 
width of the sleeves will hang in effect
they<00:00:41.120> might<00:00:41.360> restrict<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.780> radio<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.110> little

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
they might restrict the radio a little

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.510 
they might restrict the radio a little
bit<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.090> I'm<00:00:44.090> having<00:00:44.240> an<00:00:44.450> art<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:45.040> putting<00:00:46.040> up<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
bit so I'm having an art on putting up a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.840 
bit so I'm having an art on putting up a
thin<00:00:47.120> running<00:00:47.480> from<00:00:48.220> nothing<00:00:49.220> post<00:00:49.610> falls

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
thin running from nothing post falls

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.550 
thin running from nothing post falls
within<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.240> 1<00:00:50.390> for<00:00:50.600> about<00:00:50.780> 50<00:00:51.020> quids<00:00:51.290> it's<00:00:51.440> not

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
within a 1 for about 50 quids it's not

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.360 
within a 1 for about 50 quids it's not
too<00:00:51.680> expensive

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
too expensive

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.870 
too expensive
I've<00:00:53.330> got<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> hot<00:00:53.690> plate<00:00:56.080> which<00:00:57.550> we<00:00:58.550> fit<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
I've got a hot plate which we fit the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.430 
I've got a hot plate which we fit the
same<00:00:59.890> watch<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.070> connects<00:01:01.310> there<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:03.140> can<00:01:03.290> get

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
same watch it connects there you can get

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.610 
same watch it connects there you can get
in<00:01:03.590> down<00:01:03.830> there<00:01:07.840> rejigger<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.110> carbon

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
in down there rejigger the carbon

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:52.420 
in down there rejigger the carbon
obviously<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.250> my<00:01:16.370> soul<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:30.460> I'm<00:01:31.460> just<00:01:51.430> now

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
the there's a lot more space of work on

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.180 
the there's a lot more space of work on
the<00:01:57.080> engine<00:01:57.350> surprised<00:01:57.770> me<00:01:57.890> because<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.100> have

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
the engine surprised me because you have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.000 
the engine surprised me because you have
another<00:01:58.370> power<00:01:58.580> steering<00:01:58.909> pump<00:01:59.180> so<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.890> guys

kind<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.520> fun<00:02:04.670> somewhere<00:02:06.190> but<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:07.430> space<00:02:08.060> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
kind of fun somewhere but this space of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.180 
kind of fun somewhere but this space of
a<00:02:08.300> plate<00:02:08.569> with<00:02:08.750> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.020 

hopefully<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.280> get<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.670> there

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
hopefully I can get in there

Amala matter over finish the filled tank
as<00:02:23.770> well<00:02:23.800> now<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.620> main<00:02:26.800> effect<00:02:27.040> filler

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
as well now so the main effect filler

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:42.770 
as well now so the main effect filler
caps<00:02:27.490> are<00:02:27.790> right<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:40.740> put<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.770> more<00:02:41.980> cowl

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
caps are right for it put a more cowl

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.320 
caps are right for it put a more cowl
aluminium<00:02:43.780> filler<00:02:43.960> on<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:44.800> cool<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.510 

that<00:02:49.330> job<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.210> solid<00:02:52.210> 50<00:02:52.450> mil<00:02:52.630> pipe

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
that job is a solid 50 mil pipe

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:08.730 
that job is a solid 50 mil pipe
connecting<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> connect<00:02:55.630> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.050> tank<00:03:07.740> so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
connecting to the connect on the tank so

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.210 
connecting to the connect on the tank so
I<00:03:08.770> broke<00:03:09.070> did<00:03:09.310> one<00:03:09.520> of<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.960> ellipticity

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
I broke did one of the ellipticity

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.380 
I broke did one of the ellipticity
 breathe<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.040> go<00:03:15.190> grab<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.370> fin<00:03:15.610> up

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
 breathe that so go grab a fin up

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.180 
 breathe that so go grab a fin up
and<00:03:17.140> I've<00:03:17.860> never<00:03:17.980> bought<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.490> one<00:03:18.670> off<00:03:18.820> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and I've never bought this one off I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.470 
and I've never bought this one off I
plug<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> minute<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
plug in there a minute that so that

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.740 
plug in there a minute that so that
