and stuff we can skip that and then

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.900 
and stuff we can skip that and then
you've<00:00:23.470> got<00:00:23.619> pretty<00:00:23.769> basic<00:00:24.189> options<00:00:24.789> you've

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910

so<00:00:28.060> kind<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.539> like<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.689> tornado<00:00:28.990> attack<00:00:29.199> match

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590

you've got one business a computer and

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.219 
you've got one business a computer and
one<00:00:32.500> versus<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.250> other<00:00:33.280> flip<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:34.420> six<00:00:34.930> months

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.229 
one versus the other flip so six months

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:36.840 
one versus the other flip so six months
to<00:00:35.320> choose<00:00:35.620> from<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:36.190> there's<00:00:36.430> also<00:00:36.549> six

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
to choose from and there's also six

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.640 
to choose from and there's also six
stages<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.570> there's<00:00:37.780> not<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.960> huge<00:00:38.320> amount<00:00:38.440> of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
stages so there's not a huge amount of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.250 
stages so there's not a huge amount of
things<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.070> do<00:00:39.220> but<00:00:39.580> it's<00:00:40.510> still<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.870> it's

there you get electrocuted

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.030 
there you get electrocuted
you've<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.320> button<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> run<00:01:40.890> as

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you've actually got a button to run as

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 
you've actually got a button to run as
well<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> keep<00:01:41.850> trying<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.120> show<00:01:42.300> off<00:01:42.330> but

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
well which I keep trying to show off but

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
well which I keep trying to show off but
panda<00:01:42.900> keeps<00:01:43.110> beating<00:01:43.320> York<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:43.950> gonna

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
panda keeps beating York so I'm gonna

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.790 
panda keeps beating York so I'm gonna
run<00:01:44.280> away<00:01:44.400> over<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.150> boom

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
run away over here to boom

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.140 
run away over here to boom
sounds<00:01:46.800> bit<00:01:46.950> stupid<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.550> but<00:01:47.729> still<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
sounds bit stupid and all but still and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.790 
sounds bit stupid and all but still and
basically<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.110> running<00:01:49.440> attacks

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
basically you can do running attacks

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.710 
basically you can do running attacks
like<00:01:50.010> slides<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.330> stuff<00:01:51.540> like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
like slides like that and stuff like

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
like slides like that and stuff like
that<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:53.280> basically<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:54.119> much

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that so I'm that's basically pretty much

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
that so I'm that's basically pretty much
everything<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> I'll<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.100> shut<00:01:56.250> up

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
everything there is I'll just shut up

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.500 
everything there is I'll just shut up
for<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.520> few<00:01:56.670> seconds<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.119> listen<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
for a few seconds and listen to the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.359 
for a few seconds and listen to the
music<00:01:57.630> while<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.290> trying<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.770> fight<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
music while we trying to fight to the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
music while we trying to fight to the
point<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.910> we<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.479> pin<00:02:01.080> each

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
point so that we can actually pin each

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
point so that we can actually pin each
other<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.710> show<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> pin<00:02:02.400> because<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
other so I can show you a pin because it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
other so I can show you a pin because it
is<00:02:02.940> just<00:02:03.150> basically<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.960> simple<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.380> going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is just basically as simple as going

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
is just basically as simple as going
over<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.160> then<00:02:05.940> you've<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
over them and then you've got to get a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:27.590 
over them and then you've got to get a
three-count

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.970 

cervical<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.900> was<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.050> bit<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.290> music<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
was me attempting to pin a computer just

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.380 
me I've noticed those peoples going
around<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.160> place<00:02:39.370> basically<00:02:39.730> collecting

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
around the place basically collecting

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.910 
around the place basically collecting
ten<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.750> them<00:02:40.930> allows<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.500> call<00:02:41.710> for

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
ten of them allows you to call for

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.100 
ten of them allows you to call for
create<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> power<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.660> definitely<00:02:43.750> want

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
create in power so you definitely want

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.420 
create in power so you definitely want
to<00:02:44.140> collect<00:02:44.350> them<00:02:44.560> something<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.130> help<00:02:45.310> you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to collect them something to help you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.430 
to collect them something to help you
out<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.180> pretty<00:02:46.540> much<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.840> only<00:02:46.900> thing<00:02:47.050> left

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
out and pretty much the only thing left

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.230 
out and pretty much the only thing left
to<00:02:47.560> say<00:02:47.800> everything<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.000> can

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
to say everything is that you can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.940 
to say everything is that you can
continue<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.410> middle<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.770> fight

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
continue on in the middle of a fight

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920 
continue on in the middle of a fight
basically<00:02:51.850> what<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.030> mean<00:02:52.210> by<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:52.870> you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
basically what I mean by that is if you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.200 
basically what I mean by that is if you
lose<00:02:53.440> if<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:53.830> pinned<00:02:54.160> even<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.700> verses<00:02:55.090> or

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
lose if you get pinned even in verses or

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.390 
lose if you get pinned even in verses or
Corp<00:02:55.480> or<00:02:55.660> anything<00:02:56.020> against<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.770> computer<00:02:56.950> or

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
Corp or anything against the computer or

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.550 
Corp or anything against the computer or
obviously<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> cm<00:02:58.240> versus<00:02:58.720> then<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.410> can

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
obviously as a cm versus then you can

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.650 
obviously as a cm versus then you can
just<00:02:59.710> punching<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.160> won<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.730> you've<00:03:01.240> got<00:03:01.420> full

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
just punching you won so you've got full

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.020 
just punching you won so you've got full
health<00:03:01.720> back<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.440> then<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.130> like

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
health back and then you can just like

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.400 
health back and then you can just like
you<00:03:04.240> don't<00:03:04.420> even<00:03:04.450> start<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.990> fight<00:03:05.170> over

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
you don't even start the fight over

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.440 
you don't even start the fight over
again<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.340> continue<00:03:06.850> fighting<00:03:07.240> until

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
again you just continue fighting until

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.810 
again you just continue fighting until
like<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.440> give<00:03:08.620> up<00:03:08.770> pretty<00:03:09.040> much<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.430> wonder

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
like you give up pretty much and wonder

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.110 
like you give up pretty much and wonder
well<00:03:10.810> want<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.140> stop<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.490> big<00:03:12.640> dodging
