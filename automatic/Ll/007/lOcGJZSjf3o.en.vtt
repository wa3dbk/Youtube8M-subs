four<00:01:45.990> pieces<00:01:46.590> cut<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.280> um<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.750> have

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
four pieces cut out um they don't have

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
four pieces cut out um they don't have
to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.110> exact<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.890> trim<00:01:50.250> them<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.460> later

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to be exact you can trim them up later

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
to be exact you can trim them up later
but<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> together

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but now you're going to put it together

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.069 
but now you're going to put it together
so<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> start<00:01:54.240> by<00:01:54.600> looking<00:01:54.869> at

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so you are going to start by looking at

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
so you are going to start by looking at
the<00:01:55.530> letters<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.759> sides<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the letters on the sides that you

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
the letters on the sides that you
shouldn't<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.079> cut<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.969> going<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
shouldn't have cut off it's going to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
shouldn't have cut off it's going to
start<00:02:00.240> by<00:02:00.390> saying<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:01.890> going

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
start by saying a and then you're going

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.749 
start by saying a and then you're going
to<00:02:02.100> light<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.790> top<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.520> on

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to light be on top of a and then see on

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.130 
to light be on top of a and then see on
top<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.329> B<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.280> top<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.360> C<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
top of B and then be on top of C so it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.250 
top of B and then be on top of C so it
should<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.370> dcba<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.970> ABC

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
should be dcba or ABC

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.979 
should be dcba or ABC
just<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:14.010> slide<00:02:14.519> them<00:02:14.700> together<00:02:14.989> so

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
just going to slide them together so

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.740 
just going to slide them together so
that<00:02:16.019> they<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.590> online<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.540> going

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
that they are online and you are going

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.600 
that they are online and you are going
to<00:02:18.959> fold<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:22.500> line<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.370> shouldn't

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to fold on that line that you shouldn't

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.309 
to fold on that line that you shouldn't
have<00:02:23.790> cut<00:02:24.090> off<00:02:24.299> if<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.689> did<00:02:24.870> cut<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.260> off

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
have cut off if you did cut that off

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.319 
have cut off if you did cut that off
just<00:02:25.680> tape<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.129> pages<00:02:26.459> back<00:02:26.579> together<00:02:26.970> it's

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
just tape the pages back together it's

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.600 
just tape the pages back together it's
okay<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.170> won't<00:02:28.290> look<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.709> great<00:02:29.129> but<00:02:29.430> umm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
okay it won't look as great but umm

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.940 
okay it won't look as great but umm
it'll<00:02:29.720> still<00:02:30.720> work<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.200> tape<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it'll still work if you just tape on and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.860 
it'll still work if you just tape on and
it's<00:02:32.519> sort<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.849> hard<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.329> one<00:02:33.480> hand

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's sort of hard to do with one hand

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's sort of hard to do with one hand
but<00:02:35.659> you're<00:02:36.659> just<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.989> fold<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.680> that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
but you're just going to fold down that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550 
but you're just going to fold down that
black<00:02:38.190> line<00:02:38.569> if<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.659> weren't<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.019> great<00:02:40.319> at

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
black line if you weren't so great at

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.589 
black line if you weren't so great at
cutting<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.340> am<00:02:41.609> then<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> might<00:02:42.329> look<00:02:42.480> a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
cutting like I am then it might look a

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.630 
cutting like I am then it might look a
little<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.230> where<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.159> pages<00:02:44.519> are

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
little like this where the pages are

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.030 
little like this where the pages are
sort<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:44.939> uneven<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.930> things<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.349> but

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
sort of uneven and things like that but

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
sort of uneven and things like that but
you<00:02:47.129> can<00:02:47.280> easily<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.790> trim<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.209> off<00:02:48.269> so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
you can easily just trim that off so

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.270 
you can easily just trim that off so
next<00:02:49.079> we're<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.409> go<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.829> stapler

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
next we're going to go to the stapler

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.539 
next we're going to go to the stapler
and<00:02:50.430> staple<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.720> sides<00:02:52.019> down<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:53.310> show<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
and staple the sides down to show you

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.629 
and staple the sides down to show you
what<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.359> do<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
what to do and what not to do when you

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.890 
what to do and what not to do when you
stapling<00:02:57.030> because<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.269> can<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.629> sort<00:02:57.840> of

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
stapling because I can get sort of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
stapling because I can get sort of
confusing<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.459> where<00:02:59.670> you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
confusing so this is the one where you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.879 
confusing so this is the one where you
don't<00:02:59.790> want<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.629> this<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.440> don't<00:03:01.650> want<00:03:01.829> to

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
don't want to do this you don't want to

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.680 
don't want to do this you don't want to
do<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.250> lay<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.549> flat<00:03:02.909> like<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.359> where<00:03:03.659> you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
do is lay it flat like this where you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.640 
do is lay it flat like this where you
have<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:04.349> fold<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:06.329> tabs<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.079> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
have your fold and your tabs here you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.319 
have your fold and your tabs here you
don't<00:03:07.920> want<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.190> take<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.400> stapler<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.180> go

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
don't want to take the stapler and go

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.979 
don't want to take the stapler and go
like<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.459> does<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.609> is<00:03:11.819> going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.569> give<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
like that does that is going to give you

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.069 
like that does that is going to give you
this<00:03:13.889> where<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.269> opens<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
this where it just opens like that

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.349 
this where it just opens like that
that's<00:03:16.379> good<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.159> like<00:03:17.340> want<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.090> keep<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
that's good if you like want to keep it

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.809 
that's good if you like want to keep it
open<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.930> video<00:03:19.430> that's<00:03:20.430> probably<00:03:20.699> what

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
open for a video that's probably what

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.460 
open for a video that's probably what
I'll<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.329> one<00:03:21.569> since<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.139> made<00:03:22.349> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
I'll do with this one since I made it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.610 
I'll do with this one since I made it
like<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.069> these<00:03:23.910> staples<00:03:24.599> shouldn't<00:03:25.230> be

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
like this but these staples shouldn't be

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.650 
like this but these staples shouldn't be
going<00:03:25.919> horizontal<00:03:26.910> they<00:03:27.269> should<00:03:27.449> be<00:03:27.540> going

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
going horizontal they should be going

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.270 
going horizontal they should be going
vertical<00:03:28.349> like<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.879> one<00:03:30.379> this<00:03:31.379> one<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.829> kept

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
vertical like this one this one I kept

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.520 
vertical like this one this one I kept
the<00:03:32.459> fold<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.930> stapled<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.379> like

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530
