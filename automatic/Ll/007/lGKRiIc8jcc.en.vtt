00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.250
 well I 've done my toe 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.639
 I already made the bulan point here already I arrived 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 here at the time where I'm going to do my 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:50.070
 he who does the work always 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 go pulling here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 the two sides to see if it did not hold 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 no point 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.670
 sometimes we make mistakes and get 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 back and it holds one side of the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.930
 other and you can not stick your foot after 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:17.850
 teaching how to do it and I'm going to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.970
 here a stitch on the front needle and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.970
 back 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 epa 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.680
 on the back needle 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.090
 is what would be a half up front without 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.090
 do it on the back needle 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.130
 right at the beginning you already have the opening 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.130
 that you can already see the opening 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.890
 always taking away here we go 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.000
 work on one side only to do the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.770
 heel side gets your like I 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.580
 I usually do here where I finish 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:40.800
 Career, I'm only going to work on this side. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:49.590
 here from the front and back because the filter 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.660
 here we were there as here I go 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.810
 do exactly the same thing as me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.070
 I tiptoed to do the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:06.750
 heel 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:09.830
 I start to do it because if you have 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:21.920
 difficulty working with needle 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:21.920
 on a hook to the end 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:48.690
 now yes i will come here 16 without doing it 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:52.830
 exactly the same work I did and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.880
 keep up the work 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:02.519
 Just the tip of my foot, I'll do it. 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.410
 until I take the three points I'll go 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.570
 leave the three points without doing 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.160
 I took it if I get the second point 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:14.890
 now on the right 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.970
 from the inside out, I want to say that now 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.970
 I'm going to do the knitting. 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.269
 I pass here until the second point 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:47.119
 I always took it without doing it when I go 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.959
 start a career when I come back to 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.959
