let's show another one so another route

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.570 
let's show another one so another route
is<00:06:35.960> starting<00:06:36.350> from<00:06:36.530> the<00:06:36.650> sanctuary<00:06:39.580> head

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
is starting from the sanctuary head

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.779 
is starting from the sanctuary head
south<00:06:40.940> and<00:06:41.330> then<00:06:42.140> left<00:06:42.440> and<00:06:42.770> basically<00:06:43.520> hook

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
south and then left and basically hook

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.940 
south and then left and basically hook
up<00:06:43.970> with<00:06:44.180> the<00:06:44.390> route<00:06:44.690> coming<00:06:45.050> from<00:06:45.320> Kakariko

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
up with the route coming from Kakariko

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.600 
up with the route coming from Kakariko
village

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
village

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.719 
village
this<00:06:48.389> will<00:06:48.569> eventually<00:06:48.750> hook<00:06:49.259> around<00:06:49.439> and<00:06:50.189> as

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
this will eventually hook around and as

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.700 
this will eventually hook around and as
you<00:06:51.180> might<00:06:51.330> expect<00:06:51.419> it'll<00:06:51.990> drop<00:06:52.289> you<00:06:52.349> in<00:06:52.620> the

you might expect it'll drop you in the
crystal<00:06:53.099> and<00:06:53.340> again<00:06:57.020> so<00:06:58.020> basically<00:06:58.530> do<00:06:58.800> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
crystal and again so basically do the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.679 
crystal and again so basically do the
same<00:06:58.979> route<00:07:01.550> try<00:07:02.550> not<00:07:02.759> to<00:07:02.909> make<00:07:03.030> any<00:07:03.090> mistakes

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:03.689 
same route try not to make any mistakes
