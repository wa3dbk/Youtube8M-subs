00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.410
 hello friends here we are with a new 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.990
 video and this time shared between the 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.550
 barcelona and real madrid as well as 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.980
 you know these two teams are 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.070
 face by the end of the cup of 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.590
 king where the real madrid of course 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.240
 it has more favoritism as it comes 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.150
 doing a very good campaign in this 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.250
 season and Barcelona although he has not 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.289
 had very good luck in the champions 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.740
 to be eliminated against the athletic 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.220
 from madrid and al qaeda the good I think 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.520
 he's only four points from the athletic 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.110
 from madrid in the spanish league because today 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.120
 you will have the opportunity to see yourself with 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.790
 empty hands and win the king's cup 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.740
 in Real Madrid have great casualties 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.480
 how are ronaldo Christian who will not be 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.370
 although here we have it on screen but 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 he will not be playing in the final 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 then this video I bring it so that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.260
 you here under your comments 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 Well, tell me what equipment they are going to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.380
 which team are supporting who wants 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.660
 who will keep the king's cup 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.930
 and well in my opinion I think they are going to 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.870
 to be tied there are not going to be goals 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.150
 they will go 0-0 and in the penalty shootout 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.940
 is going to define this the luck defined 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.310
 of the game and then I will bring you here 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.920
 the penalties between Barcelona and the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 real madrid to see who will take the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.250
 victory in today's game good here 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.630
 we had the few plays of the game 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.180
 medium distance shots both the real 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.070
 madrid as barcelona doormen 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.040
 they were very good and there were no goals 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.530
 there I was again ronaldo with the shot 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.440
 deviated and nothing the ball did not want 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.840
 enter the final matches was going to go to 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.400
 the penalties and let's see who is going to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.020
 take the victory 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.840
 There is Victor Vidal, of course 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.869
 will not play in the king's cup since it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.600
 find injured only the goalkeeper will be 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.210
 painted then injured ronaldo comes 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.909
 against injured 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.360
 it will be that he puts it and ronaldo pointing 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.840
 when we're nervous we're going to see that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.069
 not the public that dances in the gallery 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 he has choreography all 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.980
 bernaldo and take it 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.050
 goal of ronaldo valdés that was staying 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.650
 totally cheated and that now comes 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.150
 pedro diego lopez in the bow no no what 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.780
 guess neither 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 match 11 let's see comes from gareth 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.670
 bale 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.940
 in the millionaire contract and he votes for 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.930
 barcelona you can take your first 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.240
 title of the season that starts 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.810
 Fabregas and not 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.550
 it is not for the goalkeeper the match 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.330
 that now is in favor of Barcelona 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.230
 comes benzema both I thought that yes no 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.600
 for inside and in the middle does not fail 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 yes sir he is totally cheated victor 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.660
 valdés 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.080
 huy diego lopez that moves for the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.670
 left to the right and cover it and you 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.670
 put in the end shot 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.480
 shot get like with thread I do not know by 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.989
 what the goalkeeper supported them the vice 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.890
 got what's coming, I gave Maria the skinny 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.080
 take the one that does not take it out and inside it gets 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 difficult the goalie has to cover one and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.080
 the one that comes is iniesta and there's the frame 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.090
 I do not, I guess, last chance to 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.360
 Real Madrid to achieve a draw 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.750
 to see has been nervous in the real 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.480
 begging and hugging gareth bale 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.160
 he was the one who loaded them and we're going to see there 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.010
 is that he takes modric career 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.230

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.420
 there is madrid that takes race to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.770
