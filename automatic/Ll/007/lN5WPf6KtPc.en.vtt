00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.599
 in wool second generation of our forums what you forgot about the 90s 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.249
 percent in this case 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.880
 he left him today without the called meter he did on horseback 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.970
 lisbon 15 percent 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.970

 like the corkage 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.650
 and this and that cap are being made now 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.740
 the representation 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.539
 g with this new model 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.460
 d the plan employers 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 and it's a class of groups then see 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.380
 that's why my few the benefits that have come out 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.020
 here is what we have 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.420
 the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.049
 for him the instructive that comes 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.120
 or the promotional 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.580
 ii in are the only deluxe services that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 that will come out 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 until now 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.450
 I have not told you about another 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.800
 and a third wave 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.150
 i already have this my nextel this one and this one 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.150
 we have all gathered them 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.220
 this one I'm going to get to the bamboo vih 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 and this convent against a control 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.790
 25 and all because they are only repainted 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.560
 of the 701 control 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.350
 I'm not interested 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.090
 we lack 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.360
 you will have the complete collection 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 and I hope it's head issues 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 here on the way back we are very well 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.630
 antelmo buy this 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.440
 this demolition did not buy it 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.890
 and the only one of the flights that I'm interested in is extra 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.270
 the only this my body 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.750
 is the only one who may be the one that really interests me about these funds 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.159
 repainted put three in them 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.099
 to win it from the truth 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.089
 I'm not made to be 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.789
 a classic 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.169
 but because of what little we have this others believe that in their 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.739
 comfortable 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.819
 p 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.209
 the armored spee can be 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.439
 according to what he says and the instructive 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.599
 he fished east loor to the south 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.409
 strong with black that in the chest and the flames 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.569
 in red 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.239
 to alcohol you can see here they have stops 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.309
 connect your 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:42.579
 a fine even if they do not have it 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.779
 and obviously the double cries have to go 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.759
 on both sides reverte investigate 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.759
 8 and so many that the back 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.659
 percent on the roof where he has re-election joel television I think in 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.109
 its robots form as maybe you head 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.969
 he can no longer 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.529
 appreciates 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.749
 the weak of his son or the shield 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.279
 you also have to give it 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.279
 there is a little heat 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.839
 It took a lot of work and it came out 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.819
 but giving it a lot of heat 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.389
 it is like 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.259
 get out 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.009
 dove symbol 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.309
 I'm not going to the figures 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.439
 grab well 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.019
 and this is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.879
 the only points 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.779
 now classic no brakes 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.799
 aam to transform you have to know your legs 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.729
 perhaps in order that their people 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.409
 besides that the bread like the kilmarnock 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.909
 coral rose this 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.039
 will be 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.289
 the sword 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.779
 I see that look 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:06.099
 you have to get up this panel 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.099
 and swallowed others in this way 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.319
 The OMS 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.919
 then 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.759
 coyhaique- you can see that this arm 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.759
 yes this arm 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.849
 separate all this section of the chest 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.689
 panama down 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.330
 local way to make them 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.169
 shoulders 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.890
 still possibly to take out aquila 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.479
 head of other problems 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.879
 before 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.869
 of puel instead there is that text windows you have to push them in 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.979
 to stay there 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.680
 next to these windows 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 becana insolaciÃ³n metemos this 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.819
 let's try the pta this yes 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.199
 and we lower it 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.580
 down 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.939
 and there we have for her what is the 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.969
 the part of the chest after the geop look for a great serve like kilos 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.749
 panels 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.309
 stephane dumas you have to download it 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.309
 and as the heart said 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.389
 and it's having your arms already in place 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.269
 and the legs although it seems simple is not that simple 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.799
 that the vote is that the return if those panels are here you have to import them 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.909
 well the two 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.490
 the way that is made to be acknowledged or 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.979
 with the need to enter the suitable beaches 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.400
 see him 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.589
 one round 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.589
 and push her crying 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.860
 inward 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.860
 the same as me 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.270
 let's read a rotation like this 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.050
 we put there 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.439
 Hague 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.529
 let's repeat the operation to camps 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.119
 it is not an option 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:21.119
 let's imitate and rim 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.610
 others next 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.610
 well it gets hard 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.830
 to get down here what is going to be the ankle 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.339
 and take out the foot 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.439
 there we have it 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.439
 simple the transformation ballad 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.610
 good not so much but more or less 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.960
 we put 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.680
 his sword 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.659
 and there they have it 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.740
 warned ap tomos country 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.879
 in its way 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.960
 chorus 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.949
 and you can see what 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.949
 that's nothing better year in terms of g2 obviously 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.499
 the qe2 still had 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.460
 something similar to what there was in 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.389
 by not having this 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.659
 a lot of transformation there was a lot of speculation 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:18.659
 he does 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.610
 kirchner this course in which south elbows and move alves 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:27.889
 Well, really, it's worth it for the collection 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.719
 is not bad at figures 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.529
 It is not the best 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.219
 there is better that is 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.730
 the soldiers representation of 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.259
 of an era 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.029
 of the nineties when it came out 

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:41.539
 although more likely 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:44.210
 in the second second generation 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.439
 and there they have it 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:47.659
 aa revision 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:48.580
