00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.540

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.220
 what are we going to need 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220
 two 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.140
 two cups of traditional oatmeal or 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.760
 instantaneous although two teaspoons of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.980
 Baking powder four eggs and two 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:06.520
 bananas the essence of vanilla 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:10.220
 sweetener jazz and a cup of berries 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.620
 birdies red fruits or blueberries of all 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 the voice times for the muffins not 88 for 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.300
 8 muffins and you see all this - this and 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.490
 with the minipimer 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.030
 it is processed and she 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.030
 then let's do 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.390
 in the part of then we're going to take two 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 glovers and two with the pure clear 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.840
 two vanilla essence caps 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.880
 it is assumed that 15 a teaspoon of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.740
 sugar then I think that quantity 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.330
 necessary so that everything is not 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.330
 sweet would be like 15 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.900
 what's not rich 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.610
 now let's beat everything 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 we purposely put the oven to heat 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.750
 how much do you have to warm up before 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.100
 like the 20 minutes of preheating the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 oven 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.810
 i 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.320
 workers a piece of paper so that no 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.320
 stick 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.050
 now we are going to take the masitas 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.700
 d 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.530

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:18.450
 the recipes or am 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:46.470
 Bake for 20 minutes on low heat 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.470
 now let's wait 20 minutes 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.860
 i 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.840

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.950
