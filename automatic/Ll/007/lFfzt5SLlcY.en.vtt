00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
tune but I'm just going to kind of give

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.170 
tune but I'm just going to kind of give
my<00:00:29.090> rundown<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:29.960> explain<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:31.180> basically

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
my rundown on it explain it basically

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.530 
my rundown on it explain it basically
the<00:00:32.330> there's<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:33.309> there's<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.370> verse<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:35.000> chorus

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
the there's a there's a verse a chorus

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.270 
the there's a there's a verse a chorus
and<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.110> guess<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.530> would<00:00:36.650> call<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.860> bridge

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
and I guess what you would call a bridge

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.360 
and I guess what you would call a bridge
all<00:00:38.000> right<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:38.449> verse<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.260> C<00:00:39.739> chord<00:00:41.320> and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
all right the verse is a C chord and

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.040 
all right the verse is a C chord and
then<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.580> becomes<00:00:43.940> what's<00:00:44.360> called<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.629> C<00:00:44.840> major

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
then it becomes what's called a C major

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.170 
then it becomes what's called a C major
7<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.040> it's<00:00:46.340> actually<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:46.820> easy<00:00:46.940> you

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
7 and it's it's actually really easy you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
7 and it's it's actually really easy you
just<00:00:47.300> take<00:00:47.540> your<00:00:47.630> first<00:00:47.840> finger<00:00:48.020> off

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.500 

and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.329> an<00:00:51.449> F<00:00:51.690> chord

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:08.350 

and<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.949> little<00:00:57.339> lick

kind of emphasizing the bass note with
my<00:01:30.570> ring<00:01:30.750> finger<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> hit<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> first

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.390 

and<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.270> switched<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.660> an<00:01:51.810> F<00:01:52.020> chord<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.370> I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
and I switched to an F chord and when I

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.860 
and I switched to an F chord and when I
played<00:01:53.670> f<00:01:53.910> I<00:01:54.150> know<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.300> lot<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.480> people<00:01:54.600> have

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
played f I know a lot of people have

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.020 
played f I know a lot of people have
problems<00:01:55.110> covering<00:01:55.590> both<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.980> these<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
problems covering both of these I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.780 
problems covering both of these I
actually<00:01:57.620> don't<00:01:58.620> really<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.610> just

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
actually don't really do that I just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.010 
actually don't really do that I just
play<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.720> three<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.440> then<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.220> kind<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
play it these three and then I'm kind of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.390 
play it these three and then I'm kind of
just<00:02:04.020> letting<00:02:04.260> my<00:02:04.470> first<00:02:04.680> finger<00:02:04.890> touch<00:02:05.190> that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
just letting my first finger touch that

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.280 
just letting my first finger touch that
high<00:02:05.580> E<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.300> know<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.660> mutes<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.140> little

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
high E you know and it mutes it a little

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
high E you know and it mutes it a little
bit<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.220> sometimes<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.760> easier<00:02:08.880> for

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
bit so sometimes that's easier for

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.960 
bit so sometimes that's easier for
people<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.470> we've<00:02:10.619> got<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.460> then<00:02:11.850> I'm

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
people and then we've got and then I'm

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.680 
people and then we've got and then I'm
hitting<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.330> bass<00:02:12.510> note<00:02:13.790> right<00:02:14.790> there

the<00:02:28.980> lick<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.180> where<00:02:30.420> my<00:02:30.540> middle<00:02:30.840> finger<00:02:31.170> is

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
on the F chord I hit that one time and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.090 
on the F chord I hit that one time and
then<00:02:36.330> my<00:02:36.450> ring<00:02:36.630> finger<00:02:36.840> goes<00:02:37.170> up<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:38.010> half<00:02:38.820> step

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.600 
then my ring finger goes up a half step
from<00:02:41.100> where<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.000> was<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.750> g<00:02:42.990> string

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.850 
it okay now you could actually go up
another<00:03:06.630> half<00:03:06.930> step<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.470> that's<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
another half step because that's the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:17.199 
another half step because that's the
next<00:03:08.160> note

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.990 

like<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.659> what<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> tend<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.200> do<00:03:19.409> and<00:03:20.190> then

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
like that but what I tend to do and then

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000 
like that but what I tend to do and then
the<00:03:21.150> open<00:03:21.450> B<00:03:21.599> string<00:03:21.629> which<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.260> same<00:03:22.440> note

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.260 

and<00:03:28.010> when<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.340> do<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.849> can<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.150> take

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
and when you do that you can just take

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.110 
and when you do that you can just take
your<00:03:29.450> hand<00:03:29.660> off<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.050> B<00:03:30.290> string<00:03:30.910> back<00:03:31.910> to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
your hand off for that B string back to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760 
your hand off for that B string back to
the<00:03:32.209> C<00:03:32.390> chord<00:03:32.569> again<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.080> here's<00:03:33.260> what<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
the C chord again so here's what the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.790 
the C chord again so here's what the
whole<00:03:34.190> verse<00:03:34.430> looks<00:03:34.730> like

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.630 

you

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.020 
you
you

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.860 

ok<00:03:50.030> now<00:03:50.599> let's<00:03:50.780> talk<00:03:50.959> about<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.650> chorus

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
ok now let's talk about the chorus

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.420 
ok now let's talk about the chorus
Beatles<00:03:53.870> use<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.319> a<00:03:54.379> lot<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.709> little<00:03:55.190> walk

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
Beatles use this a lot a little walk

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.100 
Beatles use this a lot a little walk
down<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.239> kind<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.420> like<00:03:56.510> adding<00:03:57.019> a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
down so it's kind of like adding a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.290 
down so it's kind of like adding a
baseline<00:03:57.590> within<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.190> within<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.610> chords<00:03:59.030> ok

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
baseline within the within the chords ok

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.360 
baseline within the within the chords ok
so<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.810> take<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.019> F<00:04:00.230> chord<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.099> keep

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
so I take the F chord and I keep

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.460 
so I take the F chord and I keep
emphasizing<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.599> first<00:04:06.049> note<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.440> chord

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
emphasizing the first note of the chord

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.289 
emphasizing the first note of the chord
like<00:04:08.860> like<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.069> we're<00:04:10.879> going<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.060> do<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
like like that we're going to do that

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.039 
like like that we're going to do that
again<00:04:11.480> but<00:04:12.379> my<00:04:12.640> ring<00:04:13.640> finger<00:04:13.819> comes<00:04:14.120> off<00:04:14.360> my

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
again but my ring finger comes off my

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.750 
again but my ring finger comes off my
middle<00:04:15.349> finger<00:04:15.650> goes<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> second<00:04:16.549> fret<00:04:16.699> on

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
middle finger goes to the second fret on

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.849 
middle finger goes to the second fret on
the<00:04:16.880> D<00:04:17.000> string<00:04:17.180> now<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.410> actually<00:04:18.560> looks

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
the D string now so it actually looks

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.979 
the D string now so it actually looks
like<00:04:18.979> an<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.190> minor<00:04:19.400> 7<00:04:19.880> but<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.630> could<00:04:20.840> also

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
like an a minor 7 but you could also

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:30.100 
like an a minor 7 but you could also
call<00:04:21.139> it<00:04:21.820> an<00:04:22.820> f<00:04:23.120> /<00:04:23.810> e<00:04:28.300> ok<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.360> here's<00:04:29.750> those<00:04:29.930> two

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
call it an f / e ok so here's those two

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.570 
call it an f / e ok so here's those two
again

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.550 

then<00:04:34.580> I'm<00:04:34.940> going<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.090> go<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.690> D<00:04:35.960> minor<00:04:36.200> chord

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
then I'm going to go to a D minor chord

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.550 
then I'm going to go to a D minor chord
so<00:04:37.550> my<00:04:37.760> middle<00:04:38.060> fingers<00:04:38.420> on<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.720> 2nd<00:04:39.170> fret<00:04:39.410> of

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
first finger on the first fret of the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.150 
first finger on the first fret of the
high<00:04:52.460> E<00:04:52.550> string<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.300> I'm<00:04:53.960> my<00:04:54.560> root<00:04:54.800> note<00:04:55.010> of

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
high E string and I'm my root note of

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.010 
high E string and I'm my root note of
that<00:04:55.250> court<00:04:55.520> is<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.730> D<00:04:56.180> string<00:04:56.450> right<00:04:56.600> here

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.629 

and<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.139> reason<00:05:00.320> i<00:05:00.710> played<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.130> way<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.370> my

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
and the reason i played this way so my

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.970 
and the reason i played this way so my
ring<00:05:01.850> finger<00:05:02.030> it's<00:05:02.690> going<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:02.990> then<00:05:03.290> go<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.770> the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
ring finger it's going to then go to the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.740 
ring finger it's going to then go to the
third<00:05:04.190> fret<00:05:04.490> on<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:05.000> string

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.990 

within<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.710> chord<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.490> here's<00:05:09.670> what<00:05:09.790> we<00:05:09.880> have

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
within that chord so here's what we have

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.310 
within that chord so here's what we have
so<00:05:10.210> far

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.540 

so<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.350> just<00:05:18.500> kind<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.710> emphasize<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.280> note

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
so I just kind of emphasize that note

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.500 
so I just kind of emphasize that note
and<00:05:19.760> then<00:05:19.820> strum<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.120> cord

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.970 

then<00:05:23.050> it<00:05:23.140> goes<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.320> G<00:05:23.770> chord<00:05:24.100> or<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.430> g7<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.890> if

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
then it goes to G chord or a g7 so if

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.260 
then it goes to G chord or a g7 so if
you're<00:05:27.100> playing<00:05:27.250> as<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.490> g7<00:05:27.850> you're<00:05:28.090> going<00:05:28.210> to

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
you're playing as a g7 you're going to

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.730 
you're playing as a g7 you're going to
use<00:05:28.360> your<00:05:28.450> ring<00:05:28.750> finger<00:05:28.960> on<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.320> 3rd<00:05:29.470> fret<00:05:29.650> of

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
use your ring finger on the 3rd fret of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.680 
use your ring finger on the 3rd fret of
the<00:05:29.890> low<00:05:29.950> E<00:05:30.070> middle<00:05:31.030> finger<00:05:31.270> right<00:05:31.390> here<00:05:31.420> and
