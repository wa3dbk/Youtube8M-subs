00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:39.250
 I think it feels pretty bad 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:43.330
 The fact that something is amplified is not particularly different from that 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:49.090

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:57.320
 It is a feeling that I can not expect it 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.030
 It was more than that 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.030
