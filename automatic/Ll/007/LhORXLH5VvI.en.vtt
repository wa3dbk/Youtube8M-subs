 back there in this way we can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 set the direction of his gaze 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 so that he began to dig 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 press the start button 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.180
 mining he go ahead and destroy everything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
 blocks under them and in front of the height 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.070
 block destructible is equal to two sides then 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.799
 there is if you put the front block here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.570
 so here the form will break put it your 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.560
 small comment 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 of course after all this you can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 invoke not this robot and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.080
 ask him to give everything 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 excavated things but for what wire 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 started to dig deeper need to click 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.700
 depo button 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 he be like that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 underground and tell by standing 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.350
 deep mines and of course in the mines 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.460
 you need to do is constantly sveschenie 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 therefore, a function is provided 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.079
 installation of torches such press here 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
 whether the playstore button chuong on ways 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.400
 torches the number of torches is not limited 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.500
 so you can bet as much as you want 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.939
 Well, of course if you’re sick of it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.579
 the robot is dripping without your knowledge then 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.990
 you need this handle stop moyen and he 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.619
 stop right here at the very end 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.479
 although the terrain light it stands and 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.740
 waiting for you, of course, to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.829
 call it to the surface is necessary 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.000
 press the spambot button again and he 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.940
 immediately move closer to you 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.230
 well, of course he can also jump 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.380
 in such a way and then jump 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.870
 on small surfaces and also he has 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.060
 There is a counter fill inventory that is 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.620
 inventory and status and when it comes to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.870
 100 percent robot will tell you 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.910
 that the wars are overflowing and you must 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.310
 pick up my lot to pick up 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.170
 his loot is necessary on the button and flood 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.640
 you are against contacting you and giving 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.100
 you all accumulated here that is here 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.130
 stone earth a little bit of blood and then 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.900
 I used to live in the summer to dig out if that's 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.030
 Well, of course it can break any 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.090
 moment if it interferes and again click on 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.860
 button slept main is about that is, 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.510
 Basically if you want to povyzhivat 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.850
 this card you can send u to drip 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.709
 over long distances even if rst he 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.680
 put you in the forerunner scary again 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.540
 call him to yourself here and get the whole 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.739
 excavation will find he began to mine 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.110
 absolutely any blocks including 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.739
 obsidian and bedrock that is absolutely 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.540
 any blocks are in principle capable of such 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.550
 here's the way to amuse with so to speak 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.220
 of course you can change direction 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.019
 straight driving time but here it comes 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.230
 there are small nuances like this 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.230
 leg starts to fail so stop mining 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.549
 North West, that is, he does not have a cash 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.590
 buggy drink a twist this happens because 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.930
 the fact that most cards simply do not allow 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.230
 him make rocks do it neatly 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 turn 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.930
 this side will not be scary here 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.380
 Of course this robot would not be so 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.790
 is interesting 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.209
 unless I have provided special 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.940
 resource pack that allows you to do 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.620
 some voice for this robot it will be in 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.890
 day to download video under video 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.690
 this resource pack is called man but if 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.049
 you add to be like this 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.700
 you change ikonochka your this thing 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.070
 he she looks like ipad that is 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.480
 ikonochka remote praline robot and here 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.220
 also kind of what posts with so white 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.049
 screen 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.989
 but the most interesting thing is that this pipe 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:04.260
 now able to speak louder 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:07.700
 so so i press the start button 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.709
 start yogurt start digging 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.890
 that is, click on the stop point he would 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.200
 talk stop digging without stopping 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.540
 dig well if you want to give him 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.950
 so I gave them my loss on a button 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.780
 rowing and he is taking his loot here these 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.470
 informs us that we can 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.310
 pick up your loot here and also 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.310
 small phrase 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 she is full the device will 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.290
 somehow she is systems 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.840
 not a robot here is a small 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.630
 clipboard so to speak chest type 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.580
 there put all of the coupons and resources if 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.400
 we will fill it in this way gradually 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:56.770
 then the robot teleports 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:00.130
 now so full press button 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.050
 give here you see he writes that amber 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:08.530
 one hundred percent and don't want to pick it up 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.540
 have there such a fun thing gulf yet 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.430
 I liked that thing 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.430
 initially she will look at a friend 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.590
 sackling he made an interesting video where 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.000
 comfort and little robot danced that is 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.500
 performed these movements but I wanted 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.080
 do not miner someone 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.540
 which will it help players 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.640
 dig up big caves and so on 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.080
 that’s basically how to explain it 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.660
 the device works u is not worth it because 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.810
 that gave the same difficult and by the way 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.840
 my if the token shared spambot hello 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.460
 I am your faithful servant, he will give 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:46.870
 random phrase depending on whether 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:51.360
 what appears so shocking what 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.740
 there will be orders lord lord 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.680
 if the beginner is not minecraft on the finger 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.730
 scary how does it work well how to say 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.030
 here we have a small clock 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.710
 generator that does this thing 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.540
 there will always be me a kingdom block on 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.240
 the air that is, it is constantly changing and 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.520
 constantly updated and the blocks are well here 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.440
 salt is very difficult the system is a lot of that 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.690
 responsible for spam block itself for turning 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.270
 this unfortunate robot is one in general 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.070
 I will not explain it anyway 10 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.950
 I liked the device and I hope you 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:24.640
 it will come in handy in your explorations of the world 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.800
 survival and push some people 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.840
 to create similar robots and on 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.770
 making something cooler in general 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.720
