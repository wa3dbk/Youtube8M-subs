dr. Dressler I'll throw this question
out<00:00:24.770> to<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.189> first<00:00:25.520> if<00:00:25.820> your<00:00:25.970> dog<00:00:26.180> has<00:00:26.349> cancer

out to you first if your dog has cancer

out to you first if your dog has cancer
of<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.619> nose<00:00:27.860> what<00:00:28.550> are<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.730> likely<00:00:28.939> signs

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
of the nose what are the likely signs

of the nose what are the likely signs
and<00:00:29.689> symptoms<00:00:30.079> that<00:00:30.169> you<00:00:30.320> might<00:00:30.439> be<00:00:30.590> looking

at<00:00:32.110> nasal<00:00:33.110> cancers<00:00:33.739> are<00:00:34.040> tricky<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.970> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
at nasal cancers are tricky and the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.049 
at nasal cancers are tricky and the
reason<00:00:35.480> why<00:00:35.630> they're<00:00:35.899> tricky<00:00:36.380> is<00:00:36.760> because<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
reason why they're tricky is because the

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.760 
reason why they're tricky is because the
fact<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.420> they<00:00:38.630> grow<00:00:39.020> within<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.590> nasal

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
fact that they grow within the nasal

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.819 
fact that they grow within the nasal
sinuses<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.940> we<00:00:41.600> can't<00:00:41.899> see<00:00:42.200> into<00:00:42.469> the<00:00:42.680> nasal

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
sinuses and we can't see into the nasal

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.450 
sinuses and we can't see into the nasal
sinuses<00:00:43.550> with<00:00:43.969> our<00:00:44.360> naked<00:00:45.020> eyes<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:45.920> guardians

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
sinuses with our naked eyes as guardians

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.760 
sinuses with our naked eyes as guardians
or<00:00:46.550> as<00:00:47.120> veterinarians<00:00:47.630> for<00:00:48.080> that<00:00:48.200> matter<00:00:48.440> and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
or as veterinarians for that matter and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.000 
or as veterinarians for that matter and
so<00:00:49.190> many<00:00:49.430> times<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.850> have<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.180> rely<00:00:50.540> on<00:00:51.010> things

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
so many times we have to rely on things

so many times we have to rely on things
progressing<00:00:52.520> to<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.850> extent<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:53.360> we<00:00:53.540> see

progressing to the extent that we see

your thoughts on this type of cancer

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.380 
your thoughts on this type of cancer
this<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.400> know<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.790> some<00:01:47.180> ways<00:01:47.360> similar

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
this is a you know in some ways similar

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.840 
this is a you know in some ways similar
to<00:01:47.810> bladder<00:01:48.290> cancer<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.890> dogs<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.549> lot

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
to bladder cancer in dogs and that a lot

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.539 
to bladder cancer in dogs and that a lot
of<00:01:49.880> patients<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> secondary<00:01:51.549> infection

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
of patients have a secondary infection

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.340 
of patients have a secondary infection
on<00:01:52.729> top<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.299> cancer<00:01:53.720> which<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.080> little

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
on top of the cancer which is a little

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.020 
on top of the cancer which is a little
bit<00:01:54.500> confusing<00:01:54.740> for<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.460> Guardian<00:01:55.850> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
bit confusing for the Guardian and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.520 
bit confusing for the Guardian and
sometimes<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.570> veterinarian<00:01:57.140> because<00:01:57.409> they

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
sometimes the veterinarian because they

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.410 
sometimes the veterinarian because they
start<00:01:57.830> them<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.070> antibiotics<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:58.909> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
start them on antibiotics and the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.380 
start them on antibiotics and the
symptoms<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.200> discharge<00:02:00.880> improves<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.240> so

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
symptoms the discharge improves and so

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.359 
symptoms the discharge improves and so
you<00:02:02.450> think<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:02.900> just<00:02:03.140> an<00:02:03.260> infection<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.100> in

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
you think it's just an infection but in

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.340 
you think it's just an infection but in
general<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.479> know<00:02:05.600> there's<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> possibility

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
general you know there's the possibility

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.199 
general you know there's the possibility
that<00:02:06.619> there's<00:02:06.950> an<00:02:07.100> underlying<00:02:07.490> cancer<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
that there's an underlying cancer in the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.779 
that there's an underlying cancer in the
nasal<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> sinus<00:02:09.349> cavity<00:02:09.799> so<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.159> can

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
nasal and the sinus cavity so that can

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.460 
nasal and the sinus cavity so that can
be<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:10.939> little<00:02:11.120> bit<00:02:11.360> confusing<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.349> think

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
be a little bit confusing and so I think

cancers<00:04:15.290> tend<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.829> stay<00:04:16.039> local<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.699> the<00:04:16.820> nasal

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
cancers tend to stay local in the nasal

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.699 
cancers tend to stay local in the nasal
and<00:04:17.329> sinus<00:04:17.389> cavity<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.199> they<00:04:18.320> have<00:04:18.409> a<00:04:18.440> low

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
and sinus cavity so they have a low

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.279 
and sinus cavity so they have a low
spread<00:04:19.070> rate<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.549> there's<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.329> two<00:04:20.840> main<00:04:21.049> types

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
spread rate and there's a two main types

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.839 
spread rate and there's a two main types
of<00:04:21.560> radiation<00:04:21.859> out<00:04:22.250> there<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.729> is

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
of radiation out there one is

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.909 
of radiation out there one is
conventional<00:04:23.510> radiation<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.320> then<00:04:24.770> there's

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
conventional radiation and then there's

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.620 
conventional radiation and then there's
a<00:04:25.010> few<00:04:25.250> places<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.699> the<00:04:25.820> country<00:04:25.909> including

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
a few places in the country including

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.570 
a few places in the country including
the<00:04:27.110> hospital<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> work<00:04:27.830> at<00:04:28.190> in<00:04:28.310> New<00:04:28.340> York

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the hospital that I work at in New York

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.040 
the hospital that I work at in New York
that<00:04:28.760> has<00:04:28.909> a<00:04:28.940> type<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.270> radiation<00:04:29.690> called

Radio<00:04:30.530> surgery<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.370> nasal<00:04:32.120> cancers<00:04:32.510> are<00:04:32.690> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
Radio surgery and nasal cancers are the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.899 
Radio surgery and nasal cancers are the
second<00:04:33.260> most<00:04:33.409> common<00:04:33.800> cancer<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.639> treat

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
second most common cancer that we treat

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.760 
second most common cancer that we treat
with<00:04:35.120> radio<00:04:35.450> surgery<00:04:35.930> with<00:04:36.110> our<00:04:36.260> cyber<00:04:36.500> 9th

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
with radio surgery with our cyber 9th

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.100 
with radio surgery with our cyber 9th
unit<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.700> allows<00:04:37.969> the<00:04:38.210> nasal<00:04:38.419> cancer<00:04:38.990> to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
unit and it allows the nasal cancer to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.220 
unit and it allows the nasal cancer to
be<00:04:39.139> treated<00:04:39.710> instead

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
be treated instead

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.960 
be treated instead
fifteen<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.770> twenty<00:04:41.040> treatments<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.640> three

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
fifteen to twenty treatments in three

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.180 
fifteen to twenty treatments in three
treatments<00:04:42.540> which<00:04:42.720> is<00:04:42.870> less<00:04:43.080> trips<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
treatments which is less trips to the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.310 
treatments which is less trips to the
hospital<00:04:44.430> less<00:04:45.390> anesthesia<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.200> your

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
hospital less anesthesia is for your

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.320 
hospital less anesthesia is for your
pets<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.830> actually<00:04:47.250> less<00:04:47.460> side<00:04:47.730> effects<00:04:48.090> with

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
pets and actually less side effects with

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.050 
pets and actually less side effects with
very<00:04:48.540> comparable<00:04:49.040> treatment<00:04:50.040> efficacy<00:04:50.250> so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
very comparable treatment efficacy so

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.030 
very comparable treatment efficacy so
again<00:04:51.540> this<00:04:51.720> is<00:04:51.930> an<00:04:52.050> evolving<00:04:52.530> field<00:04:52.740> there

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
again this is an evolving field there

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.500 
again this is an evolving field there
are<00:04:53.070> some<00:04:53.250> newer<00:04:53.430> treatment<00:04:53.940> options<00:04:54.270> out

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
are some newer treatment options out

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.810 
are some newer treatment options out
there<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.230> know<00:04:55.380> definitely<00:04:56.190> some<00:04:56.430> some
