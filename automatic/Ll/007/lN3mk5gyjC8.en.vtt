 our flight and landing in our 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.520
 arm and it is a unique adventure in the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.980
 world there is only the pioneer of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.830
 this is called scott mason in which 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.770
 it's an english camps are nepal and here in 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.200
 mexico with eric montesinos a biologist from 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 the unam we implement this new 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.830
 adventure and it has already cost us a 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.050
 little more than six months to train 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.510
 hawk to do it with all public 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.130
 thanks to eric and the wing team of 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.340
 man we have been able to implement this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.610
 new adventure that is now is already at 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.260
 reach of all public can come and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.920
 ask for him to hawking and fly 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.700
 with the birds and good is already 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.950
 you can come to do this this is a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.179
 adventure for all the public 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.180
 it is an experience without equal the truth 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.780
 that put practically nowhere 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.370
 the world is made this and now in the valley 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.040
 of bravo because it is within reach of all 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.079
 public come to those of man and 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.700
 ask for him to hawking or flying 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.579
 with the birds 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.260
 and they can fly with it or with some 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.260
 others that we will train in the future 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.500
 hello good afternoon friends my name is 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.000
 the and Montesinos I am the director of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.100
 project for hawking here in dallas del 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.260
 man we come to present you the 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.760
 project that is with a harris eagle that 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.580
 is a scientific name would be for 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.490
 botellón and cintos is a very common bird in 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.900
 mexico of its use to itself would create a bird 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.370
 low flight once you're 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.280
 used so much here would be in the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 earth as to fly great heights this 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.250
 time the one that we brought for the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 project since it is very versatile for its 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.760
 training is a bird that we can 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
 find many centers 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.230
 rehabilitation which provides us with 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.900
 opportunity to rehabilitate these 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.790
 species 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.560
 so to train this time we 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.930
 first we have to get used to 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.379
 the people used to working with 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.629
 a lot of movement in situations to 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.760
 the best of a little stress with the 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.310
 paragliding know the rope know the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.950
 flight know the public know 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 air currents 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
 and already after this once he was 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.500
 well trained she learned to enjoy 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.590
 this activity and currently is what 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.209
 More likes paragliding is very 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 versatile handling and can go 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.650
 following edwin always goes towards 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.200
 we 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.140
 once they are very noble and green is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.790
 a bird that does nothing does not have to 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.890
 fear them do not think we stretch our hands 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.640
 far so that she does not reach us if not 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.200
 it's because it 's the most 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.710
 the most comfortable part but it is a very bird 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.660
 noble you do not have to be afraid of them 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.020
 they are very well trained outside of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.020
 of man 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.500
 to tell you that this project to 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.540
 joaquin mexico also helps a little bit 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.010
 conservation we try to do 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.710
 agreements with customers he knew from 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.510
 what we Mexico 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 current agreement with two of the most 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.650
 large aviaries working in favor of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.529
 the raptors besides doing 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.599
 rehabilitation studies 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.879
 a little bit of studies as to what 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.889
 is breeding captivity a little bit of what it is 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.359
 reproduction that we started to work and 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.789
 managing rehabilitated species 

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:56.409
 mainly that they are giving you a 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.399
 opportunity for these birds to fly 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.399
 freely in the sky 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.120
 how 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.910
