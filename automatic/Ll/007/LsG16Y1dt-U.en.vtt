00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.509 

so<00:00:07.319> let's<00:00:07.500> talk<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.919> some<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> numbers

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
so let's talk about some of the numbers

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.250 
so let's talk about some of the numbers
let's<00:00:08.700> talk<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.120> how<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.389> determine<00:00:10.110> our

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
let's talk about how we determine our

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.820 
let's talk about how we determine our
own<00:00:10.559> life's<00:00:11.219> path<00:00:11.670> number<00:00:12.179> okay<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.290> let's<00:00:13.530> say

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
own life's path number okay so let's say

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.640 
own life's path number okay so let's say
let's<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.910> birthday<00:00:15.179> example<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.440> would<00:00:16.619> be

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
let's do a birthday example it would be

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.710 
let's do a birthday example it would be
5<00:00:17.520> 5<00:00:18.830> 1962<00:00:19.880> let<00:00:20.880> me<00:00:20.970> confirm<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.600> would

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
5 5 1962 let me confirm that that would

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
5 5 1962 let me confirm that that would
be<00:00:21.840> true<00:00:21.990> yes

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
be true yes

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.900 
be true yes
5<00:00:23.910> 5<00:00:24.180> 1962<00:00:25.170> someone<00:00:25.740> born<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> day<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
5 5 1962 someone born that day what you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
5 5 1962 someone born that day what you
would<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.480> add<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.840> straight<00:00:28.050> across

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
would do is just add it straight across

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.279 
would do is just add it straight across
so<00:00:28.619> let's<00:00:29.130> count<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.519> ready<00:00:29.880> 5<00:00:30.210> Plus<00:00:30.449> 5<00:00:30.480> 10

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
so let's count with me ready 5 Plus 5 10

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.130 
so let's count with me ready 5 Plus 5 10
plus<00:00:31.800> 1<00:00:31.980> xi<00:00:32.759> plus<00:00:33.059> 9<00:00:33.739> 20<00:00:34.770> ya<00:00:34.980> plus<00:00:35.370> 6<00:00:35.960> 26<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
plus 1 xi plus 9 20 ya plus 6 26 and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.459 
plus 1 xi plus 9 20 ya plus 6 26 and
plus<00:00:37.649> 2<00:00:37.860> plus<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.629> 28<00:00:39.930> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
plus 2 plus that's right so 28 in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
plus 2 plus that's right so 28 in
numerology<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> purpose<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
numerology for the purpose of the the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
numerology for the purpose of the the
simple<00:00:42.840> definition<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.350> 1<00:00:43.530> through<00:00:43.710> 9<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
simple definition of 1 through 9 and you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
simple definition of 1 through 9 and you
just<00:00:44.219> break<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.760> digit<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.570> 2<00:00:45.629> plus<00:00:45.960> 8

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just break it to one digit so 2 plus 8

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.760 
just break it to one digit so 2 plus 8
is<00:00:46.289> 10<00:00:46.530> 1<00:00:47.190> plus<00:00:47.370> 0<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> 1<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.289> life<00:00:49.500> path

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
is 10 1 plus 0 is 1 so a one life path

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.380 
is 10 1 plus 0 is 1 so a one life path
is<00:00:49.950> someone<00:00:50.190> who's<00:00:50.370> ambitious<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.180> driven

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
is someone who's ambitious and driven

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.689 
is someone who's ambitious and driven
they<00:00:52.079> strive<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.860> number<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.520> what

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
they strive to be number one of what

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
they strive to be number one of what
they<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> Life<00:00:55.110> Path<00:00:55.350> number<00:00:55.379> one

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
they do that is the Life Path number one

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
they do that is the Life Path number one
and<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.239> listening<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:57.809> some

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and for people listening right now some

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.330 
and for people listening right now some
of<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.320> will<00:00:58.469> say<00:00:58.620> well<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.219> I'm

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a master number you know master number

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880 
a master number you know master number
11<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.579> 22<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.930> say<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> purpose<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
11 or 22 I would say for the purpose of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 
11 or 22 I would say for the purpose of
what<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.400> doing<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.240> refer<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> 2<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
what we're doing to refer to the 2 and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
the 4 respectively I would add them
together<00:01:10.470> let<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> 2<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.240> simple

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
together let it be a 2 for this simple

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
together let it be a 2 for this simple
definition<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.380> let<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> 22<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> 4<00:01:14.790> for

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
definition and let the 22 be a 4 for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
definition and let the 22 be a 4 for
this<00:01:15.090> simple<00:01:15.509> definition<00:01:16.140> okay<00:01:16.920> alright<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this simple definition okay alright so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.679 
this simple definition okay alright so
we'll<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to do the numbers you add your whole

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
to do the numbers you add your whole
birthdate<00:01:24.750> together<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.530> we're<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.740> go

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
birthdate together and we're gonna go

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
birthdate together and we're gonna go
and<00:01:26.100> reduce<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.909> digit<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.450> when<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and reduce it to one digit so when I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.819 
and reduce it to one digit so when I
want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> where<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> end<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> still

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
want to where you end up if it's still

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
want to where you end up if it's still
