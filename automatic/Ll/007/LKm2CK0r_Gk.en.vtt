00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.840

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 when we see this kind of stuff we have 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 really scared to get cut 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.329

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.610
 reassured and I can not wait for them to leave 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.610
 trajectory and that links a tower somewhere else 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 the wind gradually forced l'orÃ©al 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.400
 pick up speed 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 I reduced the wings the sky is covered 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.250

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.070
 announces winds at 40 knots I am 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.510
 force to keep smiling 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.530
 sixty nine 10 meters hollow 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.290
 for more than 24 hours 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.770
 but that's it I've finally doubled 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.770
 the cape of good hope 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.980
 it's a first step behind me 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.000

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.630
 to give us a chance in 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 Atlantic 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.850

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.850
 stroke 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.720

 true that when I compare assured so I 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.850
 maximum sail but we get there 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.290
