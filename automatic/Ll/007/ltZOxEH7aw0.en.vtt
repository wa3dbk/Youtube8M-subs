better<00:04:48.380> than<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> 135<00:04:49.370> even<00:04:49.400> though<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.940> 135

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
better than the 135 even though the 135

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.480 
better than the 135 even though the 135
is<00:04:50.720> still<00:04:50.930> probably<00:04:51.380> my<00:04:51.710> second<00:04:52.190> favorite
