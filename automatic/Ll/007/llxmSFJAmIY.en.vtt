00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.679 

i'm<00:00:01.979> using<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.520> better<00:00:03.030> angel<00:00:03.300> spreadsheet

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
i'm using a better angel spreadsheet

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.249 
i'm using a better angel spreadsheet
here<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:05.120> we've<00:00:06.120> had<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> query<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.020> form

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
here and we've had a query in the form

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.810 
here and we've had a query in the form
that<00:00:07.470> says<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.220> i<00:00:08.400> achieve<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
that says how can i achieve the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.589 
that says how can i achieve the
following<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.290> see<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:11.599> we're

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
following and you can see what we're

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.940 
following and you can see what we're
trying<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.809> achieve<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> back<00:00:13.440> offset

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
trying to achieve here is back offset

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.400 
trying to achieve here is back offset
and<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.940> person's<00:00:15.269> put<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.540> equals<00:00:16.199> C

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and it's the person's put in equals C

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.550 
and it's the person's put in equals C
for<00:00:16.710> meaning<00:00:17.369> cell<00:00:17.580> c4<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.090> other<00:00:18.210> words

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
for meaning cell c4 in other words

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
for meaning cell c4 in other words
offset<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.770> value<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.279> c-4<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.779> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
offset by the value of c-4 which you can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.820 
offset by the value of c-4 which you can
see<00:00:21.960> over<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.430> but<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> problem<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> in

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
see over here but the problem is that in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
see over here but the problem is that in
this<00:00:25.830> area<00:00:26.310> within<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> spreadsheet<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.510> only

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
this area within the spreadsheet it only

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.740 
this area within the spreadsheet it only
accepts<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.820> string<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> accepts

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
accepts a string that in accepts

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
accepts a string that in accepts
characters<00:00:31.199> account<00:00:31.500> except<00:00:32.130> relative

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
characters account except relative

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
characters account except relative
commands<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.800> as<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> consequence<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
commands and as a consequence we have to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
commands and as a consequence we have to
construct<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.329> command<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> different<00:00:36.960> way

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
construct this command a different way

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.510 
construct this command a different way
and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.969> concatenate

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
and the way to do that is to concatenate

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
and the way to do that is to concatenate
variables<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.620> going

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
variables and so on so what we're going

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
variables and so on so what we're going
to<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.430> type<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> word

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to do here is if i type in the word

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.360 
to do here is if i type in the word
concatenate<00:00:46.280> con<00:00:48.590> con<00:00:49.590> eek<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.270> ten<00:00:51.270> needs

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
concatenate con con eek at ten needs

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
concatenate con con eek at ten needs
then<00:00:53.370> i<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.090> part<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> text

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then i can do the first part of the text

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.340 
then i can do the first part of the text
which<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:56.000> offset<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:58.940> then<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
which is back offset and then we need to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.250 
which is back offset and then we need to
put<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> variable<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.430> i<00:01:02.489> put<00:01:02.520> comma

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
put the variable in so if i put comma

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:15.760 
put the variable in so if i put comma
variable<00:01:05.060> comma<00:01:07.369> fill<00:01:08.600> underscore<00:01:09.600> kill<00:01:11.240> true

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:27.320 

and<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.220> goes<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> phone<00:01:21.259> kill<00:01:24.770> delay<00:01:26.330> two

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and there goes the phone kill delay two

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.429 
and there goes the phone kill delay two
and<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> half<00:01:27.509> stop<00:01:29.329> five<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.320> will

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and a half stop five then what this will

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.690 
and a half stop five then what this will
actually<00:01:31.560> achieve<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:34.530> nothing<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.670> i

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
actually achieve is nothing because i

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
actually achieve is nothing because i
haven't<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> closing<00:01:36.960> brackets<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
haven't put the closing brackets in so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.350 
haven't put the closing brackets in so
you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.909> achieve<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you can see what this can achieve is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.700 
you can see what this can achieve is
this<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.750> brought<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> variable

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this has actually brought the variable

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
this has actually brought the variable
in<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.770> string<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.600> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
in to that string and that can now be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.069 
in to that string and that can now be
displayed<00:01:46.850> now<00:01:47.850> i'm<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> check

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
displayed now i'm just going to check

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.069 
displayed now i'm just going to check
this<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.619> sure<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.420> correct<00:01:51.600> yeah

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
this to make sure this is correct yeah

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.289 
this to make sure this is correct yeah
now<00:01:52.320> I've<00:01:52.409> done<00:01:52.530> everything<00:01:52.740> correct<00:01:53.100> there

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
now I've done everything correct there

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.139 
now I've done everything correct there
so<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> we've<00:01:54.720> constructed<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:56.250> piece

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
so now that we've constructed that piece

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.050 
so now that we've constructed that piece
of<00:01:57.180> text<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.060> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
of text we can now put it in in that in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
of text we can now put it in in that in
the<00:02:00.210> main<00:02:00.360> spreadsheet<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:00.990> i<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.350> l<00:02:01.710> 9

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the main spreadsheet so if i do l 9

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.300 
the main spreadsheet so if i do l 9
equals<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.409> text<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:04.860> then

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
equals that would have text there then

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
equals that would have text there then
you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> transposes<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.930> across

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you can see it transposes that across

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
you can see it transposes that across
into<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.129> other<00:02:08.310> spreadsheet<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.270> even<00:02:09.810> if

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
into the other spreadsheet so even if

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.800 
into the other spreadsheet so even if
you<00:02:10.140> want<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.709> put<00:02:10.890> variables<00:02:11.370> inside<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you want to put variables inside the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.740 
you want to put variables inside the
scripting<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.530> do

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
scripting you can do

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.900 
scripting you can do
so<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.230> you'll<00:02:14.350> have<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> concatenate<00:02:15.040> text

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so but you'll have to concatenate text

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.850 
so but you'll have to concatenate text
the<00:02:16.480> variable<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.260> text<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.710> back

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
the variable and the text on the back

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.200 
the variable and the text on the back
end<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:18.370> link<00:02:18.580> back<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.060> main

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
end and then link back to the main

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.350 
end and then link back to the main
spreadsheet<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.780> that's<00:02:19.900> how<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.230> it
