new toys for us what you got can't do so

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
new toys for us what you got can't do so
i<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.780> two<00:00:10.080> new<00:00:10.380> cameras<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.040> three<00:00:11.250> new

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
i have two new cameras at three new

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.759 
i have two new cameras at three new
lenses<00:00:11.730> okay<00:00:12.090> today<00:00:12.509> I'm<00:00:13.200> gonna<00:00:13.320> start<00:00:13.590> off

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
lenses okay today I'm gonna start off

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.689 
lenses okay today I'm gonna start off
with<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.490> news<00:00:14.730> 3n<00:00:15.299> okay<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> NEX<00:00:16.379> 3n<00:00:16.699> it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
with the the news 3n okay the NEX 3n it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
with the the news 3n okay the NEX 3n it
replaces<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.510> NEX<00:00:18.869> f3<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.949> remember

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
replaces at NEX f3 and if you remember

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340 
replaces at NEX f3 and if you remember
you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.480> an<00:00:21.630> interchangeable<00:00:22.109> lens

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
you know it's an interchangeable lens

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
you know it's an interchangeable lens
camera<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.279> aps-c<00:00:23.760> size<00:00:24.180> sensor<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
camera it has an aps-c size sensor in it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
camera it has an aps-c size sensor in it
so<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> same<00:00:25.710> sensor<00:00:26.279> size<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.670> most

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so it's the same sensor size as most

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.570 
so it's the same sensor size as most
DSLRs<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.500> feels<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.550> it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
DSLRs this feels like it's like it's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.569 
DSLRs this feels like it's like it's
smaller<00:00:29.970> than<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:31.019> 7<00:00:31.349> month<00:00:31.439> old<00:00:31.769> yeah<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
smaller than my my 7 month old yeah so I

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
smaller than my my 7 month old yeah so I
did<00:00:33.390> bring<00:00:33.660> any<00:00:34.110> excess<00:00:34.500> three<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:35.010> today

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
did bring any excess three with me today

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.650 
did bring any excess three with me today
so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.600> some<00:00:36.780> size<00:00:37.020> comparisons<00:00:37.739> here

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
so we can do some size comparisons here

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.540 
so we can do some size comparisons here
inside<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.960> NEX<00:00:40.320> 3n<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.860> still<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> same

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
inside the NEX 3n we still have the same

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.840 
inside the NEX 3n we still have the same
16<00:00:42.030> megapixel<00:00:42.570> image<00:00:42.809> sensor<00:00:43.219> max<00:00:44.219> ISO

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
16 megapixel image sensor max ISO

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
16 megapixel image sensor max ISO
sensitivity<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.539> 16,000<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.350> those<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
sensitivity is 16,000 so those are the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190 
sensitivity is 16,000 so those are the
same<00:00:46.980> okay<00:00:47.430> what's<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:48.149> inside<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
same okay what's different inside is the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.930 
same okay what's different inside is the
brains<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> new<00:00:51.840> algorithm<00:00:52.230> on

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
brains so we have a new algorithm on

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.760 
brains so we have a new algorithm on
area-specific<00:00:53.940> noise<00:00:54.660> reduction<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.680> does

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
area-specific noise reduction what does

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.470 
area-specific noise reduction what does
that<00:00:55.829> mean<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.610> borrowed<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that mean so that's borrowed from the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.650 
that mean so that's borrowed from the
a99<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.410> very<00:00:58.829> intelligent<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.699> not<00:01:00.270> only<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a99 it's very intelligent so not only is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
a99 it's very intelligent so not only is
it<00:01:00.780> doing<00:01:01.140> those<00:01:01.289> reduction<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.370> entire

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it doing those reduction on the entire

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.369 
it doing those reduction on the entire
image<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> something<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.229> if

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
image so this is something we're like if

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
image so this is something we're like if
you<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> picture<00:01:05.939> that's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you see if you have a picture that's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
you see if you have a picture that's
like<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.510> sky<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> nice<00:01:07.590> sunset<00:01:07.920> gradient

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like a sky with a nice sunset gradient

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
like a sky with a nice sunset gradient
and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.060> something<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> texture

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and then like something with a texture

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then like something with a texture
yeah<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> bit<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> tree<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
yeah a bit so if you have a tree you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
yeah a bit so if you have a tree you
know<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.689> don't<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
know you don't want that to have the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
know you don't want that to have the
same<00:01:14.070> noise<00:01:14.460> reduction<00:01:14.760> algorithm<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
same noise reduction algorithm as the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
same noise reduction algorithm as the
sky<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.770> it'll<00:01:17.369> keep<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> tree<00:01:18.240> sharp<00:01:18.540> but

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
sky so it'll keep the tree sharp but

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
sky so it'll keep the tree sharp but
keep<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> myth<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> sky<00:01:20.490> nice<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
keep the myth the sky nice and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
keep the myth the sky nice and
continuous<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> color<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.320> cool<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
continuous in color very cool so that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
continuous in color very cool so that
improves<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:24.060> imagine<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.509> kinds<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
improves I would imagine all kinds of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
improves I would imagine all kinds of
like<00:01:25.020> edges<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> things<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.009> yeah

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
like edges and things like that yeah

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.670 
like edges and things like that yeah
nice<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.170> improvement

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
nice that's a really good improvement

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
nice that's a really good improvement
there<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.369> another<00:01:29.700> area<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.390> improve

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there so another area that we improve

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
there so another area that we improve
this<00:01:30.900> autoportrait<00:01:31.530> framing<00:01:31.979> before<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this autoportrait framing before on the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.539 
this autoportrait framing before on the
NEX<00:01:33.299> f3<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:34.049> only<00:01:34.200> were<00:01:34.680> able<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.340> one

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
NEX f3 we only were able to do it on one

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.510 
NEX f3 we only were able to do it on one
face<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.600> person<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> image<00:01:37.979> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
face so one person on in that image but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
face so one person on in that image but
now<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.840> happens<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> have

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
now just like what happens if you have

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
now just like what happens if you have
like<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.740> people<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.460> properly<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.450> we

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like two people just like properly so we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
like two people just like properly so we
act<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.110> heard<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.710> complained<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
act we heard that complained a lot and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.690 
act we heard that complained a lot and
we<00:01:44.909> improve<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.110> camera<00:01:46.530> can

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
we improve this so now this camera can

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
we improve this so now this camera can
intelligently<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:48.990> people<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
intelligently on see two people and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190 
intelligently on see two people and
often<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:51.000> cool<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.600> also

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
often that way very cool and then also

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
often that way very cool and then also
on<00:01:52.470> top<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.280> were<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.880> why

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
on top of that we were like you know why

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
on top of that we were like you know why
not<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.420> further<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.590> Auto<00:01:55.979> Mac

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
not go further so we have Auto Mac

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
not go further so we have Auto Mac
framing<00:01:57.090> okay<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.200> shooting<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
framing okay so if you're shooting a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310 
framing okay so if you're shooting a
macro<00:01:58.920> image<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> flower<00:01:59.939> it'll<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
macro image like a flower it'll use that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.800 
macro image like a flower it'll use that
same<00:02:01.560> sort<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.130> rule<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.490> third<00:02:02.729> rule<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.600> make

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
same sort on rule of third rule and make

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
same sort on rule of third rule and make
a<00:02:03.840> better<00:02:04.020> composition<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.950> yet<00:02:05.369> there's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a better composition and yet there's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
a better composition and yet there's
another<00:02:06.240> feature<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
another feature that we

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
another feature that we
it's<00:02:08.100> called<00:02:08.280> auto<00:02:08.610> tracking<00:02:08.970> framing<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's called auto tracking framing and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's called auto tracking framing and
the<00:02:10.410> camera<00:02:10.740> knows<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.209> you're

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the camera knows now that if you're

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.540 
the camera knows now that if you're
tracking<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.870> subject<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.100> moving<00:02:14.310> in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
tracking a subject and it's moving in

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.330 
tracking a subject and it's moving in
one<00:02:14.730> direction<00:02:14.780> it'll<00:02:15.780> take<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.890> original

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
one direction it'll take that original

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.730 
one direction it'll take that original
picture<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.819> crop<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
picture and crop it so that it's a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.130 
picture and crop it so that it's a
better<00:02:19.950> composition<00:02:20.430> leaving<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:21.630> space<00:02:21.930> in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
better composition leaving more space in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
better composition leaving more space in
in<00:02:22.500> front<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> object<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
in front of the object that's in the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.809 
in front of the object that's in the
moving<00:02:25.140> direction<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> mean<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.640> addition

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
moving direction so I mean in addition

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.090 
moving direction so I mean in addition
to<00:02:27.030> being<00:02:27.319> smaller<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.470> mean<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.770> feels<00:02:28.950> like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to being smaller I mean this feels like

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.400 
to being smaller I mean this feels like
it's<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.790> small<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.540> out<00:02:31.110> what

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's really small really like out what

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.660 
it's really small really like out what
other<00:02:31.560> physical<00:02:31.920> differences<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.520> seeing

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
other physical differences are we seeing

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.550 
other physical differences are we seeing
here<00:02:32.760> I'm<00:02:33.239> gonna<00:02:33.360> go<00:02:33.540> from<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> similarities

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
here I'm gonna go from the similarities

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.250 
here I'm gonna go from the similarities
first<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.730> axs<00:02:36.120> three<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.959> tilting

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
first then axs three on the tilting

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
first then axs three on the tilting
under<00:02:37.950> 80<00:02:38.100> degree<00:02:38.430> screen<00:02:39.060> will<00:02:39.270> be<00:02:39.360> very

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
under 80 degree screen will be very

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.320 
under 80 degree screen will be very
popular<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.200> kept<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.650> cool<00:02:41.330> one

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
popular so we kept that cool one

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.850 
popular so we kept that cool one
different<00:02:42.780> thing<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> first<00:02:43.709> for

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
different thing and this is a first for

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.660 
different thing and this is a first for
any<00:02:44.640> X<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.410> zoom<00:02:46.410> lever<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
any X is the zoom lever here so it's a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.600 
any X is the zoom lever here so it's a
electronical<00:02:48.360> zoom<00:02:49.140> lever<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.459> can

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
electronical zoom lever and then you can

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.970 
electronical zoom lever and then you can
zoom<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.300> out<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.110> its<00:02:52.319> position<00:02:52.800> like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
zoom in and out and its position like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.550 
zoom in and out and its position like
this<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.790> ever<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.560> self-portraits

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this so if you ever do self-portraits

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
this so if you ever do self-portraits
you<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:55.920> actually<00:02:56.100> zoom<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:57.120> easily<00:02:57.600> like

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you can actually zoom not easily like

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.590 
you can actually zoom not easily like
that<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.769> like<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.550> still<00:02:59.850> has<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> flash

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
that I like that it still has a flash

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.130 
that I like that it still has a flash
pop-up<00:03:01.050> flash<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.470> well<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.819> really

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
pop-up flash as well so just like really

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.370 
pop-up flash as well so just like really
but<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.489> here<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.000> height<00:03:06.239> is

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
but it you can see here the height is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.770 
but it you can see here the height is
reduced<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.130> thanks<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
reduced a lot and that's thanks to the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.710 
reduced a lot and that's thanks to the
lens<00:03:09.989> here<00:03:10.319> it's<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.890> collapsible<00:03:11.700> lens<00:03:11.880> one

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
lens here it's a collapsible lens one

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.090 
lens here it's a collapsible lens one
thing<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:13.230> forgot<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.590> mention<00:03:13.950> is

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
thing that I have forgot to mention is

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.229 
thing that I have forgot to mention is
that<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.910> also<00:03:15.239> has<00:03:15.680> assumed<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.980> lever<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:18.060> oh

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
that it also has assumed a lever here oh

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.900 
that it also has assumed a lever here oh
that's<00:03:18.959> convenient<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.680> yeah<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.340> if<00:03:20.700> you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
that's convenient but yeah if if you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940 
that's convenient but yeah if if you
don't<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.480> zoom<00:03:22.260> lever<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.799> can

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
don't like that zoom lever you can

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
don't like that zoom lever you can
always<00:03:23.310> use<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.730> zoom<00:03:23.880> ring<00:03:23.940> here<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.110> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
always use the zoom ring here so you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.050 
always use the zoom ring here so you
have<00:03:25.709> actually<00:03:26.040> three<00:03:26.250> controls<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.850> zoom

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
have actually three controls for zoom

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.270 
have actually three controls for zoom
the<00:03:27.570> ringing<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.170> lever<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.070> lever

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280

that's correct yeah so what I have here
is<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.090> SLT<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> 58<00:04:40.530> replacing<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.430> a57<00:04:41.970> and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
is the SLT a 58 replacing the a57 and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.210 
is the SLT a 58 replacing the a57 and
we're<00:04:42.930> really<00:04:43.050> excited<00:04:43.410> about<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:43.740> model

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
we're really excited about this model

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.040 
we're really excited about this model
because<00:04:44.550> there's<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> lot<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.390> improvement<00:04:45.840> in

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
because there's a lot of improvement in

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.290 
because there's a lot of improvement in
this<00:04:46.230> one<00:04:46.380> as<00:04:46.500> well<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.670> has<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.820> completely

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
this one as well so it has a completely

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.230 
this one as well so it has a completely
new<00:04:48.540> sensor<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.770> a57<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.640> had<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.820> 16

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
new sensor on the a57 it had a 16

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.090 
new sensor on the a57 it had a 16
megapixel<00:04:51.330> understand<00:04:52.140> sir<00:04:52.290> but<00:04:52.320> now<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:53.040> the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
megapixel understand sir but now on the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.090 
megapixel understand sir but now on the
58<00:04:53.640> we<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> 20<00:04:54.630> megapixel<00:04:54.780> image<00:04:55.770> sensor

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
58 we have a 20 megapixel image sensor

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.460 
58 we have a 20 megapixel image sensor
okay<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.400> that's<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:56.760> jump<00:04:56.940> hell<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.750> then<00:04:57.960> max

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
okay so that's a jump hell and then max

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.190 
okay so that's a jump hell and then max
ISO<00:04:59.010> sensitivity<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.910> 16,000<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.020> that

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
ISO sensitivity is 16,000 is that

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.260 
ISO sensitivity is 16,000 is that
different<00:05:01.470> than<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.680> 57<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.700> same<00:05:02.910> so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
different than the 57 that's the same so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.530 
different than the 57 that's the same so
I'm<00:05:03.570> very<00:05:03.900> good<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.080> low<00:05:04.320> light<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.880> also<00:05:06.240> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
I'm very good in low light but also the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.180 
I'm very good in low light but also the
brains<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.960> beyonc<00:05:07.320> processor<00:05:07.890> that's

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
brains the beyonc processor that's

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.190 
brains the beyonc processor that's
changed<00:05:08.700> as<00:05:08.850> well<00:05:08.880> so<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.420> talked<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.840> little<00:05:09.990> bit

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
changed as well so I talked a little bit

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.080 
changed as well so I talked a little bit
about<00:05:10.530> area-specific<00:05:11.250> noise<00:05:11.820> reduction

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
about area-specific noise reduction

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.660 
about area-specific noise reduction
that's<00:05:12.810> also<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.350> here<00:05:13.740> borrowed<00:05:14.340> from<00:05:14.550> the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
that's also in here borrowed from the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.600 
that's also in here borrowed from the
a99<00:05:15.210> cool<00:05:15.780> we<00:05:16.320> also<00:05:16.530> have<00:05:16.890> an<00:05:17.100> improvement<00:05:17.430> in

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
a99 cool we also have an improvement in

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.230 
a99 cool we also have an improvement in
the<00:05:17.790> PDF<00:05:18.360> as<00:05:18.630> well<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:20.070> 57<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.700> was<00:05:20.790> LCD

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the PDF as well in the 57 that was LCD

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.290 
the PDF as well in the 57 that was LCD
now<00:05:21.510> we<00:05:21.570> get<00:05:21.780> OLED<00:05:22.260> TV<00:05:22.860> on<00:05:22.950> ice<00:05:23.220> on<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.850> night<00:05:24.060> I

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
now we get OLED TV on ice on the night I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.180 
now we get OLED TV on ice on the night I
like<00:05:24.450> that<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.750> led<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:25.560> find<00:05:25.830> her<00:05:25.920> is<00:05:26.010> like

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
like that that led you find her is like

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.040 
like that that led you find her is like
working<00:05:26.550> its<00:05:26.700> way<00:05:26.880> oh<00:05:27.180> yeah<00:05:27.420> cross<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.870> line

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
working its way oh yeah cross the line

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.960 
working its way oh yeah cross the line
so<00:05:28.440> another<00:05:28.830> improvement<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.460> we<00:05:29.520> made<00:05:29.790> on<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
so another improvement that we made on a

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.560 
so another improvement that we made on a
50<00:05:30.510> is<00:05:30.750> lock-on<00:05:31.200> AF<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:32.280> does<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.550> help<00:05:32.910> so

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
50 is lock-on AF so does that help so

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.290 
50 is lock-on AF so does that help so
that<00:05:33.960> helps<00:05:34.320> because<00:05:34.530> there's<00:05:35.430> only<00:05:35.640> 15

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
that helps because there's only 15

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.970 
that helps because there's only 15
points<00:05:36.630> of<00:05:36.750> Asia<00:05:36.900> which<00:05:37.320> is<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.500> lot<00:05:37.770> for

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
points of Asia which is a lot for

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.280 
points of Asia which is a lot for
entry-level<00:05:38.370> cameras<00:05:39.180> but<00:05:39.390> because<00:05:40.110> there's

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
entry-level cameras but because there's

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.620 
entry-level cameras but because there's
only<00:05:40.470> 15<00:05:40.890> points<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.220> AF<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:42.030> are<00:05:42.120> limited<00:05:42.540> in

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
only 15 points of AF you are limited in

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.020 
only 15 points of AF you are limited in
the<00:05:42.810> center<00:05:43.110> but<00:05:43.290> if<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.160> if<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.700> camera<00:05:45.000> is

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
the center but if that if the camera is

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
the center but if that if the camera is
intelligent<00:05:45.720> enough<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.930> recognize<00:05:46.590> that

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
intelligent enough to recognize that

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.950 
intelligent enough to recognize that
there's<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.100> big<00:05:47.130> or<00:05:47.550> object<00:05:48.030> then<00:05:48.390> if<00:05:48.630> you<00:05:48.810> go

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
there's a big or object then if you go

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.260 
there's a big or object then if you go
off<00:05:49.170> to<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.590> screen<00:05:49.890> a<00:05:49.920> little<00:05:50.040> bit<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.700> will

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
off to the screen a little bit it will

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.850 
off to the screen a little bit it will
still<00:05:51.540> recognize<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.170> it<00:05:52.410> needs<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.710> focus

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
still recognize that it needs to focus

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.160 
still recognize that it needs to focus
on<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.340> okay<00:05:53.730> so<00:05:53.790> you<00:05:54.150> move<00:05:54.360> out<00:05:54.570> of<00:05:54.600> that<00:05:54.780> AF

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
on you okay so you move out of that AF

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.750 
on you okay so you move out of that AF
area<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.650> then<00:05:55.770> back<00:05:55.980> into<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.370> it's<00:05:56.490> like<00:05:56.610> oh

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
area and then back into it it's like oh

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.330

else do we have here um the usual

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.110 
else do we have here um the usual
standard<00:06:13.680> for<00:06:13.920> that<00:06:14.220> salty<00:06:14.520> camera<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:14.910> very

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
standard for that salty camera is very

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.240 
standard for that salty camera is very
high<00:06:15.330> frame<00:06:15.900> rates<00:06:16.140> so<00:06:16.530> five<00:06:16.830> frames<00:06:17.070> per

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
high frame rates so five frames per

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.640 
high frame rates so five frames per
second<00:06:17.640> at<00:06:17.820> full<00:06:18.120> res<00:06:18.330> or<00:06:18.600> eight<00:06:19.200> frames<00:06:19.410> per

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
second and tell zoom high-speed shooting

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.770 
second and tell zoom high-speed shooting
great<00:06:22.080> and<00:06:22.290> then<00:06:22.590> obviously<00:06:22.950> in<00:06:23.510> all<00:06:24.510> these

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
great and then obviously in all these

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.500 
great and then obviously in all these
cameras<00:06:25.260> have<00:06:26.220> a<00:06:27.230> 60<00:06:28.230> I<00:06:28.260> full<00:06:29.010> HD<00:06:29.510> movie

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
cameras have a 60 I full HD movie

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.750 
cameras have a 60 I full HD movie
capabilities<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.410> 20

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
capabilities and 20

4p as well great also looks like we have
a<00:06:34.310> new<00:06:34.520> kit<00:06:34.760> lens<00:06:35.000> on<00:06:35.210> this<00:06:35.390> guy<00:06:35.570> good<00:06:36.230> eye<00:06:36.350> good

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
a new kit lens on this guy good eye good

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.530 
a new kit lens on this guy good eye good
eye<00:06:36.770> so<00:06:37.070> this<00:06:37.340> is<00:06:37.490> a<00:06:37.520> new<00:06:37.730> kit<00:06:37.910> lens<00:06:38.120> it's<00:06:38.360> the

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
eye so this is a new kit lens it's the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.410 
eye so this is a new kit lens it's the
18<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.050> 55<00:06:39.440> mark<00:06:39.980> 2<00:06:40.250> version<00:06:40.790> okay<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.330> what

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
18 to 55 mark 2 version okay and what

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.580 
18 to 55 mark 2 version okay and what
are<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.570> differences<00:06:41.840> between<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.290> mark<00:06:42.470> one

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
are the differences between the mark one

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.500 
are the differences between the mark one
of<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.740> market<00:06:43.010> or<00:06:43.130> the<00:06:43.400> cosmetically<00:06:43.940> it's<00:06:44.450> a

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
of the market or the cosmetically it's a

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.670 
of the market or the cosmetically it's a
little<00:06:44.690> bit<00:06:44.780> different<00:06:45.080> we<00:06:45.140> have<00:06:45.170> on<00:06:45.380> the<00:06:45.470> top

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
little bit different we have on the top

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.000
