coconut<00:00:44.610> coal<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.719> did<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.050> job

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
coconut coal I think they did a good job

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
coconut coal I think they did a good job
making<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> weight<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.700> tell

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
making these the weight of it I can tell

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.990 
making these the weight of it I can tell
that<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.199> compressed<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that it's not as compressed and just for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
that it's not as compressed and just for
argument's<00:00:54.449> sake<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> compare

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
argument's sake I'm going to compare

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
argument's sake I'm going to compare
these<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.710> Koch<00:00:55.860> own<00:00:56.010> articles<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:57.390> are

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
these two Koch own articles as those are

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
these two Koch own articles as those are
my<00:00:57.750> clothes<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.199> toys<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
my clothes or toys and I think that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
my clothes or toys and I think that
cokin<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.079> set<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> bar<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
cokin are really set the bar there so of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.560 
cokin are really set the bar there so of
course<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.820> comparison<00:01:03.300> that's<00:01:03.449> going

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
course that the comparison that's going

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
course that the comparison that's going
to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:04.559> far<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> sizing<00:01:05.460> they

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to be as far as the sizing they

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.140 
to be as far as the sizing they
definitely<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.369> chose<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
definitely got it right so they chose to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
definitely got it right so they chose to
stay<00:01:09.540> away<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.229> cube<00:01:10.590> shape<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:11.220> was

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
stay away from the cube shape which was

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
stay away from the cube shape which was
an<00:01:11.580> epic<00:01:11.850> fail<00:01:12.350> instead<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.470> went<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
an epic fail instead they went with the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
an epic fail instead they went with the
square<00:01:14.520> shape<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:15.930> job<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:17.750> far

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
square shape so good job on that as far

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
square shape so good job on that as far
as<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.080> long<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> takes<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.770> light<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.720> took<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
as how long it takes a light I took a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
as how long it takes a light I took a
little<00:01:22.020> clip<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.220> switch<00:01:23.400> over

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
little clip for you so let's switch over

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:32.370 
little clip for you so let's switch over
to<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:02:05.170 

you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.960 

you

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.900 

so<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.260> see<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.740> took<00:02:19.100> quite<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.670> bit<00:02:19.850> of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so you can see it took quite a bit of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.090 
so you can see it took quite a bit of
time<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.570> was<00:02:20.690> about<00:02:20.810> 8<00:02:21.050> minutes<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.560> 45

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
time so it was about 8 minutes and 45

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.520 
time so it was about 8 minutes and 45
seconds<00:02:22.640> till<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> get<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.720> coals<00:02:23.960> fully<00:02:24.260> lit

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
seconds till I get the coals fully lit

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.700 
seconds till I get the coals fully lit
