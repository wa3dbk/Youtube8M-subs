 Hello Swami Asoka , I often 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.030
 ask how to reset to factory 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 ios 10 status on macbook on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 aimaks are very easy to load 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.580
 computer we hold down the alt button in general 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 then select the recovery partition and 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.640
 we get a special menu in which we 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.170
 will need to make literally a couple 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.849
 movements trick is that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.009
 mode online and mavericks 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 installed via the Internet without 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.380
 any additional flash drives 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 and all such other things therefore if you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.329
 need to erase before selling 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.309
 unequivocally and irrevocably all data from 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 computer and make it so that it is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 out of the box I'll show you what 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 for this you need here choose Russian 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699
 language if here it should be 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 of course and see we get into such 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.250
 unpretentious utility actually 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 os 10 we do not need a menu here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.480
 restore reinstalled need 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.010
 disk utility and in it we do very 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.890
 simple story we need to erase 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.530
 hard disk we just format it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 rigidly and irrevocably post about how you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 click erase back no way 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 We are with you sterlet hard drive more 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.060
 there is no computer system and now we 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 it remains only to reinstall os 10 and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.340
 it's very simple just a few 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.549
 clicks 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.710
 we click continue and if you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.070
 connected to the internet and you should be 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 connected to the internet if not then either 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
 wi-fi or anything else you see and recovery 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 hd 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.200
 it is a non-erasable partition and happens 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 the next 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.210
 and you load OS 10 mavericks given 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.159
 if you were mount online 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.170
 boot it takes this one in 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.549
 depending on the speed of the internet there 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
 half an hour two 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.659
 and you get a computer which but 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 look now there are about two left 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.820
 hours but this figure will be constantly 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.670
 fall the idea is that when you follow 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.960
 reboot see that very menu 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.549
 greetings where you will need 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 make initial setup 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.379
 systems and stuff like that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.130
 everything is great on computers and the floor with 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.960
