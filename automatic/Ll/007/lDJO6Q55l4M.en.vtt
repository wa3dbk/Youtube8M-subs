afterwards I was so blown away by the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.670 
afterwards I was so blown away by the
fact<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.209> somebody<00:02:44.989> was<00:02:45.200> actually<00:02:45.290> working

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
asked him a scientific question about

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.869 
asked him a scientific question about
what<00:02:56.599> he<00:02:56.900> was<00:02:57.049> doing<00:02:57.410> he<00:02:58.040> explained<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.549> me<00:02:58.640> and

on<00:03:16.810> chronic<00:03:17.810> injury<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.530> we<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.859> to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
on chronic injury in that we want to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.699 
on chronic injury in that we want to
draw<00:03:19.190> out<00:03:19.400> any<00:03:19.850> kind<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.180> axons<00:03:21.139> or<00:03:21.380> any<00:03:21.530> kind

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.680 
draw out any kind of axons or any kind
of<00:03:21.769> cell<00:03:22.100> type<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.579> put<00:03:22.819> into<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.480> spinal

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
of cell type that we put into the spinal

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.300 
of cell type that we put into the spinal
cord<00:03:23.989> we<00:03:24.590> want<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.799> make<00:03:24.920> sure<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.190> it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
cord we want to make sure that it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.819 
cord we want to make sure that it
reconnects<00:03:25.670> with<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.970> muscle<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:27.139> is<00:03:27.620> not

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
reconnects with a muscle that is not

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.039 
reconnects with a muscle that is not
functioning<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.549> make<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.450> function<00:03:29.810> again

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
functioning and make it function again

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.289 
functioning and make it function again
so<00:03:30.349> you're<00:03:30.500> trying<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.950> get<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.430> motor<00:03:31.970> neuron

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
so you're trying to get a motor neuron

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.589 
so you're trying to get a motor neuron
mm-hmm<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.650> grow<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.370> some<00:03:34.970> cases<00:03:35.420> probably

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
mm-hmm to grow in some cases probably

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.550 
mm-hmm to grow in some cases probably
several<00:03:36.139> feet<00:03:36.470> yes<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.690> muscles<00:03:39.079> re

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
several feet yes to the muscles re

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.259 
several feet yes to the muscles re
elevated<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.400> stimulate<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.849> muscle

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
elevated and we stimulate the muscle

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.449 
elevated and we stimulate the muscle
okay<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.079> work<00:03:42.260> you're<00:03:42.500> doing<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:43.099> think

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
okay the work you're doing I think

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.430 
okay the work you're doing I think
you're<00:03:43.549> passionate<00:03:43.819> about<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:45.109> feel

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
you're passionate about and you feel

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.559 
you're passionate about and you feel
there's<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.680> lot<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.919> hope<00:03:46.130> it's<00:03:47.090> obviously<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
there's a lot of hope it's obviously a

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.580 
there's a lot of hope it's obviously a
field<00:03:47.870> -<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.560> comes<00:03:48.950> with<00:03:49.130> controversy<00:03:49.849> and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
field - that comes with controversy and

the cells that we work with embryonic

the cells that we work with embryonic

them is destroyed mm-hmm but people

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.110 
them is destroyed mm-hmm but people
maybe<00:04:03.200> don't<00:04:03.500> understand<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.430> most

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
maybe don't understand that in most

maybe don't understand that in most
cases<00:04:05.389> those<00:04:05.840> embryos<00:04:06.200> are<00:04:06.440> going<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.650> be

cases those embryos are going to be

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.250 
cases those embryos are going to be
destroyed<00:04:07.069> anyway<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.019> been

destroyed anyway have you been

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.319 
destroyed anyway have you been
confronted<00:04:09.919> by<00:04:10.190> people<00:04:10.639> that<00:04:10.669> kind<00:04:11.209> of

and how do you you know address those
questions<00:04:15.139> well<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.130> interesting

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
questions well that's interesting

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
those people have addressed me about

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.430 
those people have addressed me about
that<00:04:20.239> they<00:04:20.510> they<00:04:20.900> don't<00:04:21.079> believe<00:04:21.260> in

that they they don't believe in

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.899 
that they they don't believe in

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
embryonic stem cell research they think

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.720 
embryonic stem cell research they think
it's<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.390> know<00:04:23.599> it's<00:04:23.840> immoral<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
it's you know it's immoral and the

everybody Jennifer you are a fighter too

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.350 
everybody Jennifer you are a fighter too
I<00:04:37.850> think

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
I think

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.950 
I think
extreme<00:04:38.870> fighter<00:04:39.790> tell<00:04:40.790> us<00:04:40.910> about<00:04:41.240> what<00:04:41.810> you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
extreme fighter tell us about what you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.990 
extreme fighter tell us about what you
think<00:04:42.380> your<00:04:42.710> hopes<00:04:43.010> are<00:04:43.280> for<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.550> stem<00:04:43.760> cell

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
think your hopes are for the stem cell

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.730 
think your hopes are for the stem cell
field<00:04:44.210> what<00:04:44.540> will<00:04:44.750> come<00:04:45.140> out<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:45.380> this

research<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.670> do<00:04:47.090> believe<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.870> know

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
research I do believe that you know

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.110 
research I do believe that you know
within<00:04:48.740> my<00:04:48.830> lifetime<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.250> will<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.940> able<00:04:50.000> to

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
within my lifetime I will be able to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.900 
within my lifetime I will be able to
walk<00:04:50.300> again<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:51.560> do<00:04:51.830> think<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.610> lot<00:04:52.640> of

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
walk again I do think that a lot of

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.410 
walk again I do think that a lot of
people<00:04:53.180> will<00:04:53.390> be<00:04:53.990> either<00:04:54.950> treated<00:04:55.730> with<00:04:55.910> stem

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
people will be either treated with stem

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.630 
people will be either treated with stem
cells<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:57.190> alleviate<00:04:58.190> some<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.520> their

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
cells and alleviate some of their

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.850 
cells and alleviate some of their
disease<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.630> maybe<00:04:59.780> not<00:05:00.020> cure<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.290> completely

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
disease and maybe not cure it completely

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.380 
disease and maybe not cure it completely
but<00:05:01.640> I<00:05:02.240> do<00:05:02.930> think<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:04.730> will<00:05:04.910> create<00:05:05.270> a

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
but I do think that it will create a

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.900 
but I do think that it will create a
huge<00:05:05.660> impact<00:05:06.050> on<00:05:06.200> our<00:05:06.260> society<00:05:06.820> thank<00:05:07.820> you
