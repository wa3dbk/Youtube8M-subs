today when he perceives the next

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.730 
today when he perceives the next
technology<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.480> has<00:00:06.660> potential<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
technology that has potential for the

biggest impact on global public health
well<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> didn't<00:00:11.099> give<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.219> if<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.030> want

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
to pick one thing it's got to be robot

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.370 
to pick one thing it's got to be robot
you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.750> don't<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> go<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you know if you don't want to go to a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.140 
you know if you don't want to go to a
convention<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.400> send<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.699> robots

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
convention you can just send your robots

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.560 
convention you can just send your robots
come<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:22.160> please<00:00:23.160> convention<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.090> mean

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
come in please convention I mean

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
come in please convention I mean
seriously<00:00:25.340> when<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.760> something<00:00:27.000> like

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
seriously when we look at something like

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.160 
seriously when we look at something like
maternal<00:00:27.720> mortality<00:00:28.609> it's<00:00:30.050> there's<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
maternal mortality it's there's a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.950 
maternal mortality it's there's a
certain<00:00:31.470> level<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.009> can't<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.520> below<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
certain level you can't get below if you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
certain level you can't get below if you
can't<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.410> c-sections<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.540> doing<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
can't do c-sections and doing a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
can't do c-sections and doing a
c-section<00:00:37.079> requires<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> sterile<00:00:38.309> environment

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
c-section requires a sterile environment

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
c-section requires a sterile environment
a<00:00:39.090> certain<00:00:39.420> amount<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.100> expertise<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> yet<00:00:43.140> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a certain amount of expertise and yet in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.760 
a certain amount of expertise and yet in
some<00:00:43.559> ways<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.430> fairly<00:00:44.730> routine<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> if

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
some ways it's fairly routine and so if

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.430 
some ways it's fairly routine and so if
you<00:00:46.920> could<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> robot<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you could have a robot that can do that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
you could have a robot that can do that
that's<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.160> fairly<00:00:50.460> inexpensive<00:00:51.090> that's

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that's that's fairly inexpensive that's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.700 
that's that's fairly inexpensive that's
a<00:00:51.390> great<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:54.410> robots<00:00:55.410> or

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
a great thing if you can have robots or

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.939 
a great thing if you can have robots or
LDL<00:00:56.280> elderly<00:00:56.940> care<00:00:57.149> anyways<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> know

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
LDL elderly care anyways you know

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
LDL elderly care anyways you know
computers<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.390> sitting

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
computers are going from just sitting

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
computers are going from just sitting
there<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.829> only<00:01:01.949> type<00:01:03.019> into<00:01:04.019> them

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
there and you can only type into them

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
there and you can only type into them
and<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.100> something<00:01:05.430> else<00:01:05.519> green

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and just see something else green

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.719 
and just see something else green
they're<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> wear<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.430> see

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
they're going to wear now they can see

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.410 
they're going to wear now they can see
and<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.530> high-end<00:01:11.420> visual

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and you have high-end visual

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
and you have high-end visual
applications<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> military<00:01:14.280> likes<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
applications like the military likes to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.830 
applications like the military likes to
see<00:01:15.000> things<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:16.619> cool<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
see things so they think that's cool and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.710 
see things so they think that's cool and
Xbox<00:01:18.840> games<00:01:19.560> connect<00:01:20.159> yeah<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> see

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Xbox games connect yeah they like to see

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
Xbox games connect yeah they like to see
you<00:01:21.810> bowl<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.560> play<00:01:22.710> tennis<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.430> crazy

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you bowl and play tennis and crazy

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510 
you bowl and play tennis and crazy
things<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.380> computers<00:01:25.920> it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
things like that so the computers it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
things like that so the computers it's
learning<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.960> learning<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> talk

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
learning to see it's learning to talk

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
learning to see it's learning to talk
it's<00:01:29.070> learning<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> listen<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.299> learning<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's learning to listen it's learning to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's learning to listen it's learning to
do<00:01:30.810> handwriting<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.950> learning<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> move

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
do handwriting and it's learning to move

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.859 
do handwriting and it's learning to move
around<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.280> ambulatory<00:01:36.270> stop<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
around and then the ambulatory stop is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.520 
around and then the ambulatory stop is
really<00:01:37.500> moved<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.250> lot<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.479> lab<00:01:39.659> phenomena

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
really moved a lot in the lab phenomena

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.899 
really moved a lot in the lab phenomena
which<00:01:40.650> means<00:01:40.890> five<00:01:41.100> years<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.610> it'll<00:01:41.790> be

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which means five years now it'll be

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
which means five years now it'll be
quite<00:01:42.150> cheap<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.290> dexterity<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.369> or

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
quite cheap the dexterity things or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
quite cheap the dexterity things or
maybe<00:01:44.850> five<00:01:45.180> years<00:01:45.240> behind<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
maybe five years behind one of the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100 
maybe five years behind one of the
hardest<00:01:47.340> dexterity<00:01:47.939> problems<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> world

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hardest dexterity problems in the world

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.539 
hardest dexterity problems in the world
is<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.920> elderly<00:01:50.220> patient

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
is so you have an elderly patient

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
is so you have an elderly patient
sitting<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> bed<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
sitting on a bed and you have to go and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
sitting on a bed and you have to go and
lift<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> patient<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> carry<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
lift that patient up and carry the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
lift that patient up and carry the
patient<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:54.960> help<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
patient over and then help them get the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.880 
patient over and then help them get the
rest<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> toilet<00:01:57.890> humans

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
rest or take them to the toilet humans

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.149 
rest or take them to the toilet humans
are<00:01:59.040> surprisingly<00:01:59.880> good<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:01.009> just<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
are surprisingly good at this just the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.780 
are surprisingly good at this just the
amount<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.579> feedback<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.229> understanding<00:02:04.229> of
