00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.370
 zucchini and potatoes osella hello line but 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.080
 a jump from less I have already been there 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.629
 potatoes and I'm going to crush them with it 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.459
 potato masher then potatoes 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.320
 crushed we add directly 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:24.280
 the whole egg a little salt a little 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.050
 totally vegetarian ricetto pepper 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.850
 because now we are going to insert the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.850
 grated zucchini wash well 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.839
 let's add a floor let's start a 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.129
 knead if you want first with the 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:44.280
 fork and then even with your hands a little 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.629
 of breadcrumbs 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.429
 then the osella line we cut it to 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.890
 small cubes because it will be ours 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.640
 filled with the vegetarian hit then 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.260
 let's start taking composte 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.769
 let's inform the meatballs not too much 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.149
 small then of this size 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.649
 crush them slightly inside 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.530
 formed a real hole where 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:10.240
 we are going to insert our cube of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.660
 line and close a passage 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.900
 in breadcrumbs still ready in the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 meatballs are ready and we go into the oven 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.660
 at 190 degrees we keep them half an hour 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:32.180
 beautiful meatballs are ready and I think 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.160
 that my technical gesture then 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.870
 obviously you can choose if you speak 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.070
 fried or baked I preferred to make them 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.160
 baked because it is a recipe 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 summer absolutely low in content 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.940
 fat because we do n't have either 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.760
 added a little oil 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.370
 but you can choose them in the different ones 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.790
 ways of cooking now I can see 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.790
 one open 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.190
 because the rush and the meatballs of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.170
 zucchini potatoes and osella lines are 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.170
 vegetarian ready to 100 facets 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:32.740
