00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we're going to talk about the use of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.680 
we're going to talk about the use of
positive<00:00:08.250> reinforcement<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:09.059> horse<00:00:09.269> training

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
positive reinforcement in horse training

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.540 
positive reinforcement in horse training
positive<00:00:09.990> reinforcement<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> addition

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
positive reinforcement is the addition

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.459 
positive reinforcement is the addition
of<00:00:11.639> something<00:00:12.000> pleasant<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.080> moment<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
of something pleasant at the moment a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.499 
of something pleasant at the moment a
horse<00:00:13.679> does<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> correct<00:00:14.250> behavior<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.360> will

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
horse does a correct behavior this will

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
horse does a correct behavior this will
make<00:00:15.660> them<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:15.960> likely<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> trial<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
make them more likely to trial that

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
make them more likely to trial that
behavior<00:00:17.460> again<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> easiest<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.199> use

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
behavior again the easiest way to use

behavior again the easiest way to use
positive<00:00:20.310> reinforcement<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.210> simply<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> give

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
positive reinforcement is simply to give

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.330 
positive reinforcement is simply to give
the<00:00:21.750> horse<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.199> scratch<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> withers

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the horse a scratch here at the withers

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.120 
the horse a scratch here at the withers
when<00:00:23.580> he<00:00:23.699> does<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.210> thing<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
when he does the right thing for you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
when he does the right thing for you
scientists<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.369> proven<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.090> scratch

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
scientists have proven that a scratch

scientists have proven that a scratch
here<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> withers<00:00:28.289> actually<00:00:28.949> lowers<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
here on the withers actually lowers the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.980 
here on the withers actually lowers the
heart<00:00:29.609> rate<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> horse<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.630> help<00:00:30.810> him

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
heart rate of the horse and can help him

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530 
heart rate of the horse and can help him
relax<00:00:31.430> you'll<00:00:32.430> often<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.759> people<00:00:33.210> patting

relax you'll often see people patting
horses<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> neck<00:00:35.070> when<00:00:35.640> he

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
horses like this on the neck when he

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
horses like this on the neck when he
does<00:00:35.910> something<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.079> padding<00:00:37.770> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
does something good but padding like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
does something good but padding like
that<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.309> intrinsically<00:00:38.940> rewarding<00:00:39.210> for

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that is not intrinsically rewarding for

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
that is not intrinsically rewarding for
the<00:00:39.809> horse<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.530> means<00:00:40.710> nothing<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.160> him

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the horse it really means nothing to him

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.490 
the horse it really means nothing to him
and<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:41.760> far<00:00:42.000> better<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.450> reward<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and you're far better to reward with the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.580 
and you're far better to reward with the
scratch<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.129> withers<00:00:45.110> horses<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.289> love

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
scratch of the withers horses also love

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
scratch of the withers horses also love
food<00:00:46.860> rewards<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> hard<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> give<00:00:48.510> them

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
food rewards but it's hard to give them

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
food rewards but it's hard to give them
a<00:00:48.629> correct<00:00:49.140> food<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> correct<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.670> when

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
a correct food at the correct time when

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
a correct food at the correct time when
you're<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.390> board<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you're on board so we use the use of a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
you're on board so we use the use of a
secondary<00:00:54.120> reinforcer<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> clicker<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
secondary reinforcer like a clicker the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
secondary reinforcer like a clicker the
first<00:00:56.910> part<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> training<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.690> horse<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.050> a

first part of training a horse on a
clicker<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> secondary<00:00:59.190> reinforcer<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
clicker or a secondary reinforcer is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
clicker or a secondary reinforcer is
with<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> use<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.230> target<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.550> we've<00:01:02.730> made

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
with the use of a target here we've made

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.460 
with the use of a target here we've made
a<00:01:02.969> target<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.660> we've<00:01:03.960> trained<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> horse

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
a target and we've trained the horse

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.340 
a target and we've trained the horse
overnight<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.939> when<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.420> touches<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> target

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
overnight but when he touches the target

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.640 
overnight but when he touches the target
he<00:01:07.530> gets<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.070> click<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.960> click<00:01:10.200> means<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
he gets a click and the click means the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
he gets a click and the click means the
food<00:01:10.860> reward<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.280> coming<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.210> means<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.600> don't

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
food reward is coming this means I don't

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.440 
food reward is coming this means I don't
have<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.920> food<00:01:14.189> available<00:01:14.450> exactly

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
have to have the food available exactly

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
have to have the food available exactly
at<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.840> time<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.740> instead<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
at the right time but instead I can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
at the right time but instead I can
click<00:01:19.820> for<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> behavior<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
click for the behavior I want and the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
click for the behavior I want and the
horse<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> click<00:01:24.390> means

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
horse will so know that the click means

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.219 
horse will so know that the click means
that<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> reward<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:26.040> soon<00:01:26.340> follow<00:01:27.229> good

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that the reward will soon follow good

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.039 
that the reward will soon follow good
boy<00:01:29.150> once<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.360> horse<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.689> learned<00:01:30.900> to

associate the use of a click with food
rewards<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.009> parts<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
rewards we can use it in all parts of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
rewards we can use it in all parts of
our<00:01:35.579> training<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> improve<00:01:36.570> his<00:01:36.750> responses

our training to improve his responses
for<00:01:38.189> instance<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.119> teach<00:01:39.479> him<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> step

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
for instance I can teach him to step
