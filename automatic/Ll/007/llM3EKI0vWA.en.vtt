00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.309
 and go to order this box that I have 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.860
 all of ties for all those who 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.990
 as I like crafts or 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.599
 sew or such I keep all the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.099
 ties because these are imaginary and 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.730
 I keep all the ties that reach my 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.890
 hands these are from ski clothes comes 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.110
 to hang the hangers and such because 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.650
 they are always of some use late or 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.830
 early 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.780
 what I'm going to do is save them in 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.850
 these bags these bags that you see here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.350
 I use these things and I have several 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.019
 sizes 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.829
 that is something for many things you have 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.109
 seen in other videos of mine 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.629
 and what I 'm going to do is screw each 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.820
 tie of these because if I have them like this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.800
 besides that I almost do not fit every time 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 I want to catch one find it is me 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.140
 difficult and then it coils me with the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 others entangled me and when I want to go back to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.759
 put everything inside again it costs me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.689
 I have to squeeze the ties 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.320
 etc 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.740
 once you put this here as it is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 I think there's going to be more space and I think 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.500
 that I will even be able to put more ties 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 I have in this box and we'll see if it's 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.300
 I will show you how it is once 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.300
 put all these ties in bags 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 Y 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.009
 good and this is all here are all 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.149
 those that were there and now I put them in 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.149
 the box to see if they fit and 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.310
 well then that's how all of them are 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.719
 included also these that I do not want anymore 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.719
 save more in this box 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.440
 because they are because they are not really 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.410
 ties and then we want to save here 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.570
 but that is what it would occupy with the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.040
 ease those that were probably in 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.040
 the box when I started him 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.800
 that is, adding all this is all that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.530
 I had when I started the video 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.330
 so as you see now you have everything 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.190
 much more orderly easier to 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.270
 find if for example imagine yourself 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.130
 I want a golden ribbon I know everything I have 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.290
 all these pieces of golden ribbon and 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.860
 before I did not know if I had a piece or 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.880
 four as you really find the end 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.880
 and the same as 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.849
 and an expense for example red then 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.700
 I found these red ribbons and now I know 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.709
 that I have these and I do not have to look for 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.470
 see what else I have without finding it 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.690
 I occupy a little less space all and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.620
 I can save some more of this box 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.620
 how I had thought 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.110
 as you can see besides the arms 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.390
 I keep everything like this for example this is my 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.960
 sequins box that I've gone 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.090
 putting together and every time you see something that I 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.570
 I like and I'm catching um 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.780
 too much and I use it little the truth but 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.420
 good and this is the way he organized 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.640
 the buttons that also take bags 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.440
 by colors by shapes as it is left 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 You have also seen the video in which 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.260
 I make this idea of â€‹â€‹organization and if not 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.910
 is to organize all my kurt purina and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.980
 If you have not seen it, I'll tell you 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.200
 I recommend it is quite useful and not only 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.750
 for opening I could also save my 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.720
 sequins for example like this or others 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.950
 small things like how are you 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.750
 pebbles away fixo or whatever 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.660
 recently in buy and that these 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.460
 containers that are to organize and you 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.160
 hang on the wall are not too 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.020
 cheap but they are worth it because this 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.570
 It's my room where I keep all 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.740
 You're trapped and I'm pretty 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.310
 comfortable 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.590
 you can see that inside these gossip 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.050
 the cajoncitos all that I keep is 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.009
 also in sachets 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.740
 maybe buy some of these remains 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.650
 more organizers but good so 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.500
 now I have to put up here what 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.470
 there is 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.470
 roared he facilitated giving it and
