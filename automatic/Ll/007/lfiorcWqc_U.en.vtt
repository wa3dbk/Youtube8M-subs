okay<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.220> tutorial<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.850> on<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.659> back

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay so this tutorial is on the back

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay so this tutorial is on the back
muscles<00:00:04.350> if<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.950> want<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> learn<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.490> bit<00:00:05.730> more

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
muscles if you want to learn a bit more

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.900 
muscles if you want to learn a bit more
in<00:00:06.180> detail<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.740> back<00:00:07.919> muscles<00:00:08.370> look<00:00:08.790> at

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
in detail about the back muscles look at

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.749 
in detail about the back muscles look at
my<00:00:09.030> individual<00:00:09.599> tutorials<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.920> extrinsic

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
my individual tutorials on the extrinsic

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.459 
my individual tutorials on the extrinsic
muscles<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> back<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.170> intermediate

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
muscles of the back and the intermediate

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.430 
muscles of the back and the intermediate
and<00:00:13.889> deep<00:00:14.700> muscles<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> back<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.719> talked<00:00:16.170> about

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and deep muscles the back I talked about

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.730 
and deep muscles the back I talked about
innovation<00:00:17.690> insertion<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.529> kind

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
innovation insertion and all that kind

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.200 
innovation insertion and all that kind
of<00:00:19.800> stuff<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> bit<00:00:20.430> more<00:00:20.550> detail<00:00:20.730> than<00:00:21.090> I'm

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
of stuff in a bit more detail than I'm

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.160 
of stuff in a bit more detail than I'm
going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
going to do here so I'm just going to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
going to do here so I'm just going to
work<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:25.350> superficial<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.250> deep<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.750> point

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
work from superficial to deep and point

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
work from superficial to deep and point
out<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> major<00:00:29.010> muscles<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
out some of the major muscles that you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.240 
out some of the major muscles that you
should<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.300> about

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
should know about

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.340 
should know about
so<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.730> muscle<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> trapezius

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
so this muscle here is the trapezius

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
so this muscle here is the trapezius
probably<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.170> this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably all know this one and this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
probably all know this one and this
muscle<00:00:37.590> elevates<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> depresses<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
muscle elevates and depresses the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
muscle elevates and depresses the
scapula<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> also<00:00:41.070> retract<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
scapula and it can also retract the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.200 
scapula and it can also retract the
scapula

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
scapula

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
scapula
so<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.899> pzs<00:00:43.290> you've<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
so that's your pzs you've got the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.080 
so that's your pzs you've got the
latissimus<00:00:45.390> dorsi<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.789> Latin<00:00:47.789> for

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
latissimus dorsi here which is Latin for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
latissimus dorsi here which is Latin for
the<00:00:48.120> broadest<00:00:48.510> muscle<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> back<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the broadest muscle of the back and this

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.389 
the broadest muscle of the back and this
is<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> biggest<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:51.390> muscle<00:00:51.809> obviously<00:00:52.170> um

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
is the biggest back muscle obviously um

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
is the biggest back muscle obviously um
and<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.820> muscle<00:00:54.210> inserts<00:00:54.629> onto<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> humerus

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and this muscle inserts onto the humerus

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
and this muscle inserts onto the humerus
so<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.149> ducts<00:00:58.190> extends<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> internally

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
so it a ducts extends and internally

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.240 
so it a ducts extends and internally
rotates<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> humerus<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.949> working<00:01:04.949> our

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rotates the humerus so just working our

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
rotates the humerus so just working our
way<00:01:05.280> deeper<00:01:06.890> just<00:01:07.890> underneath<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.470> trapezius

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
way deeper just underneath the trapezius

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
way deeper just underneath the trapezius
you've<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> rhomboids<00:01:11.520> through<00:01:12.060> one

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you've got the rhomboids through one

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
you've got the rhomboids through one
boyd<00:01:12.420> major<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> rhomboid<00:01:16.080> minor<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
boyd major and the rhomboid minor and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.310 
boyd major and the rhomboid minor and
these<00:01:17.850> muscles<00:01:18.210> attach<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> scapula<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
these muscles attach to the scapula and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.469 
these muscles attach to the scapula and
they<00:01:22.320> function<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.549> keep<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.060> scapula

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
they function to keep the scapula

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.469 
they function to keep the scapula
pressed<00:01:24.750> against<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> thoracic<00:01:25.680> wall<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
pressed against the thoracic wall and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
pressed against the thoracic wall and
and<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> trapezius<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.009> contracted

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and when the trapezius is contracted

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
and when the trapezius is contracted
they<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.869> retract<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> scapula<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.579> here

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
they can retract the scapula so here

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
they can retract the scapula so here
you've<00:01:35.790> got<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.180> levator<00:01:36.479> scapula<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:39.110> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you've got the levator scapula and this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590 
you've got the levator scapula and this
muscle<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> attaches<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
muscle as you can see it attaches to the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
muscle as you can see it attaches to the
top<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> scapula<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.610> elevates<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
top of the scapula and it elevates the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380 
top of the scapula and it elevates the
scapula<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> contracted<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> that's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
scapula when it's contracted so that's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
scapula when it's contracted so that's
the<00:01:48.600> levator<00:01:48.810> scapulae<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.950> muscles

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the levator scapulae these two muscles

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.960 
the levator scapulae these two muscles
here<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> those<00:01:53.070> muscles<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:53.820> I've

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
here so those muscles which I've

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.999 
here so those muscles which I've
discovered<00:01:54.329> are<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> extrinsic<00:01:55.409> muscles<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
discovered are the extrinsic muscles of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219 
discovered are the extrinsic muscles of
the<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.869> working

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the back now we're going to be working

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
the back now we're going to be working
our<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.350> deeper<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> intermediate

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
our way deeper to the intermediate

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
our way deeper to the intermediate
muscle<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.890> you've<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
muscle there and here you've got the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.709 
muscle there and here you've got the
serratus<00:02:03.899> posterior<00:02:04.850> superior<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
serratus posterior superior and the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.880 
serratus posterior superior and the
serratus<00:02:07.020> posterior<00:02:07.350> inferior

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.860 

so<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.760> see<00:02:12.910> these<00:02:13.060> muscles<00:02:13.240> they<00:02:13.570> attach

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
so you can see these muscles they attach

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.900 
so you can see these muscles they attach
to<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> ribs<00:02:14.410> add<00:02:15.150> these<00:02:16.150> superior<00:02:16.960> one

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to the ribs add these superior one

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.040 
to the ribs add these superior one
elevates<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> ribs<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> inferior<00:02:19.900> one

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
elevates the ribs and the inferior one

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.320 
elevates the ribs and the inferior one
depresses<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> ribs<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.670> these<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330

got<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.610> retirees<00:04:59.240> muscles<00:05:03.640> so<00:05:04.640> that<00:05:05.030> covers

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
got the retirees muscles so that covers

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.800 
got the retirees muscles so that covers
very<00:05:06.920> briefly<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.910> muscles<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.390> back<00:05:08.570> if

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
very briefly the muscles of the back if

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.090 
very briefly the muscles of the back if
you<00:05:08.870> want<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.110> look<00:05:09.170> in<00:05:09.320> more<00:05:09.470> depth<00:05:09.710> at<00:05:09.920> those

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
you want to look in more depth at those

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.340 
you want to look in more depth at those
take<00:05:10.670> a<00:05:10.700> look<00:05:10.940> at<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.270> individual<00:05:11.960> details

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
take a look at the individual details

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.580 
take a look at the individual details
I've<00:05:12.560> done<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:12.920> those<00:05:13.250> various<00:05:13.730> groups<00:05:14.590> but

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
I've done on those various groups but

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.140 
I've done on those various groups but
hopefully<00:05:15.890> that's<00:05:16.070> useful<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:16.760> just

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
hopefully that's useful and you just

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.720 
hopefully that's useful and you just
shows<00:05:17.690> how<00:05:17.990> which<00:05:18.890> muscles<00:05:19.280> are<00:05:19.340> deep<00:05:19.520> which

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
shows how which muscles are deep which

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.380 
shows how which muscles are deep which
muscles<00:05:20.180> muscles<00:05:20.660> are<00:05:20.780> superficial
