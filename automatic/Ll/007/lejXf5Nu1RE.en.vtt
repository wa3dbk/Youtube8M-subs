00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 yes, here I am again borging 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.350
 am on the map ella air and that is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 a standard I'm driving the new ones 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.230
 come German tank destroyer hunter 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.199
 piece 3 b this is a panzer hunter the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 Stage 4 and the exact technical 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.960
 Explanation when the winder was built 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.539
 I will take you to the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.720
 put vehicle description because I like me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.989
 that did not want to notice everything 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.660
 but I drive it with the 10 5 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.190
 centimeter can almost never shoot without 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.530
 That's why I have 20 bullets 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.750
 four gold and here normal 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.400
 armor-piercing bullets myself 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.820
 I have to admit that I have to play the vehicle 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.329
 with pleasure 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.409
 he makes me really fun or fun or 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.019
 fun all this may call me now 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.869
 have already fought so after a few 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.439
 Dear, I won him there too 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.799
 missed a premium paint camouflage 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:23.830
 have a permanent camouflage for 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:26.380
 gold are you standing there funny to me 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.829
 not to the enemy 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.939
 that is unwise even weaker than that 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.939
 you can not offer 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 and as you see with ali far 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.140
 distance there I have done harm 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 had with armor-piercing ammunition 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.880
 maybe something can bounce off that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.170
 I just went out of my way 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 and found that for me 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.840
 at the 10 5 the hr bullets were 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.520
 one can be a very effective agent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 with this vehicle also in t six 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.580
 fight very well 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.820
 Only in that one sees here the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 then the opponent already gets one 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.720
 after the others and is then offended 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.480
 I do not want to say but he suffers 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 again and again harm to harm 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.150
 damage 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 maybe he will not get one shots in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.080
 at 46 but an animal of four or 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 also partially eloquent seventh 45th 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.670
 is he really nice to play your goal 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.140
 a bit more accurate then we do it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.209
 possibly also takes place in Bonn 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.810
 to meet 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.200
 you see that is really pissed off 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.200
 Well 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.000
 and yes 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.930
 I have to say I have the wrong button 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.590
 actually I wanted the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.610
 revive driver 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 but what the hell are we doing now 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.349
 bypass to the front 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.870
 maybe we 'll still get it 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.870
 from which we can make ourselves 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.180
 otherwise I am with the performance 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:01.480
 pretty beautiful worked as cd 4 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.129
 So you go do that with squeaky clean 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.200
 performance and he said this car 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.799
 makes me personally fun that can also 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 which has been accessible since the fourth tier 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.019
 you can try it out 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.109
 then please also some 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.669
 comments he is good he is not like that 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.120
 good fun as well as never 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.120
 to not be shy 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:41.080
 I'll be right here 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:45.580
 evaluation I am really curious that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:49.990
 We would have been worth a class 2 then 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:58.240
 that is also the grim reaper then 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:00.100
 I was the third best team 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.580
 four shots fired four direct 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.240
 hit the land 4 effective hits 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.330
 Damage 846 have two hits keeping that up 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.300
 were 2 effective hits an opponent 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.710
 I discovered four enemies damaged and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.030
 of course, the four destroyed 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.290
 seen financially 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.530
 That was 14 1694 credits 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:31.420
 net profit thanks to premium without premium 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.160
 they are still 9363 so too 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.040
 not bad for animal 4 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.530
 they always talk about level 4 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.880
 this vehicle so you can not 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.980
 compare with 14 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.000
 then I fought a simple one 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:49.870
 made and that was 888 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.960
 Experience points I'll show you again 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:06:05.300
 quickly find the new premium garage 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:09.699
 that has become quite nice what 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.699
 other than a gloomy hangar bunker 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.870
 and what to look said colors 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.229
 structures a vehicle's finenesses 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.949
 yes lighting thanks to the skylights and 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.380
 lighting you see roddick has become 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:32.690
 really hard given 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:36.039
 Schattenwurf and other things so 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.699
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.699
 Eggs are boring
