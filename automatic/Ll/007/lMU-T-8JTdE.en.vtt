want to approach unseen so let's look
around<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.460> little<00:02:22.490> bit<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.720> town<00:02:23.990> of

around a little bit this is the town of
acre<00:02:24.410> we<00:02:25.100> modeled<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.760> based<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.510> historical

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
acre we modeled this based on historical

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.680 
acre we modeled this based on historical
documents<00:02:27.770> from<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.490> period<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.450> Third

Crusade<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.500> again<00:02:31.250> everything<00:02:31.970> is

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
Crusade and again everything is

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.360 
Crusade and again everything is
interactive<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.380> no<00:02:33.650> level<00:02:33.920> design

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
interactive there is no level design

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.080 
interactive there is no level design
path<00:02:35.410> actually<00:02:36.410> if<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.800> back<00:02:37.370> up<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:37.940> can

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
path actually if you can back up we can

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.310 
path actually if you can back up we can
maybe<00:02:38.270> show<00:02:38.600> them<00:02:38.840> another<00:02:39.080> path<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.200> we

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
maybe show them another path so we

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.780 
maybe show them another path so we
really<00:02:42.500> want<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.890> give<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> player<00:02:43.400> an

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
really want to give the player an

really want to give the player an
ability<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.870> express<00:02:45.260> themselves<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.160> you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
ability to express themselves and you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.580 
ability to express themselves and you

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
can see that his stuff there decided to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.380 
can see that his stuff there decided to
swing<00:02:48.920> under<00:02:49.100> he<00:02:49.459> could<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.760> stepped<00:02:50.000> above

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
swing under he could have stepped above

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.000 
swing under he could have stepped above
and<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:51.050> exactly<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.680> kind<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:51.950> thing

the<00:02:59.600> character<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.050> little<00:03:00.110> bit<00:03:00.440> let's<00:03:01.070> get

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the character a little bit let's get

the character a little bit let's get
down<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.790> our<00:03:02.030> main<00:03:02.660> business<00:03:02.930> which<00:03:03.590> is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
down to our main business which is

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
finding William right now we're using

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.280 
finding William right now we're using
our<00:03:08.360> intuition<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.650> scan<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.250> crowd<00:03:10.430> below<00:03:11.290> we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
our intuition to scan the crowd below we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.440 
our intuition to scan the crowd below we
can<00:03:12.320> understand<00:03:12.950> who<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> crowd<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.120> for

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
can understand who in the crowd is for

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.720 
can understand who in the crowd is for
or<00:03:14.630> against<00:03:14.989> us<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.410> most<00:03:15.980> importantly<00:03:16.459> right

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
or against us and most importantly right

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.729 
or against us and most importantly right
now<00:03:16.970> it'll<00:03:17.150> help<00:03:17.420> us<00:03:17.600> pinpoint<00:03:17.840> our<00:03:18.230> target

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
now it'll help us pinpoint our target

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.520 
now it'll help us pinpoint our target
now<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.580> think<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.390> guy<00:03:20.750> over<00:03:20.959> there<00:03:21.730> um

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
now I think it's that guy over there um

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.080 
now I think it's that guy over there um
ok<00:03:24.530> there<00:03:24.890> are<00:03:24.920> multiple<00:03:25.370> ways<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.820> could<00:03:25.940> do

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
ok there are multiple ways we could do

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.660 
ok there are multiple ways we could do
this<00:03:26.269> we<00:03:26.420> could<00:03:26.570> blast<00:03:26.780> down<00:03:27.110> full<00:03:27.500> speed<00:03:27.890> high

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
this we could blast down full speed high

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.820 
this we could blast down full speed high
profile<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.480> what<00:03:29.630> I'd<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.410> do<00:03:30.590> this

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
profile but what I'd like you to do this

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.400 
profile but what I'd like you to do this
time<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.489> go<00:03:32.150> slowly<00:03:32.540> we're<00:03:32.989> going<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.200> show

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
time is go slowly we're going to show

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.289 
time is go slowly we're going to show
off<00:03:33.560> something<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.430> call<00:03:34.670> social

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
off something that we call social

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.660 
off something that we call social
stealth<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.860> an<00:03:36.980> idea<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.549> you're

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
stealth so this is an idea that you're

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.759 
stealth so this is an idea that you're

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
like your hidden when you're doing

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.210 
like your hidden when you're doing
things<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.780> are<00:03:41.870> socially<00:03:42.440> acceptable<00:03:42.950> and

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
we're going to use these monks we've

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.970 
we're going to use these monks we've
done<00:03:47.630> some<00:03:47.810> helping<00:03:48.200> missions<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> help<00:03:48.799> them

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.949 
out so they're going to let us blend in
and<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:52.190> way<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:52.640> approach<00:03:53.060> our<00:03:53.390> target

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
and this way we can approach our target

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.470 
and this way we can approach our target
without<00:03:54.650> attracting<00:03:55.519> too<00:03:55.730> much<00:03:55.850> attention<00:03:55.910> I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
without attracting too much attention I

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.830 
without attracting too much attention I
think<00:03:56.510> now<00:03:56.900> is<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.140> good<00:03:57.230> time<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.650> branch<00:03:58.070> off

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
think now is a good time to branch off

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.140 
think now is a good time to branch off
let's<00:03:59.840> walk<00:04:00.110> up<00:04:00.320> slowly<00:04:00.680> before<00:04:01.430> they<00:04:01.790> realize

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
let's walk up slowly before they realize

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.070 
let's walk up slowly before they realize
what's<00:04:02.390> going<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.640> key<00:04:04.850> moment<00:04:05.269> of

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
what's going on and the key moment of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.810 
what's going on and the key moment of
assassination<00:04:08.320> after<00:04:09.320> this<00:04:09.530> full<00:04:10.400> chaos

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
assassination after this full chaos

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.690 
assassination after this full chaos
breaks<00:04:11.269> out<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.799> want<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.220> escape<00:04:13.489> as

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
breaks out and now you want to escape as

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.880 
breaks out and now you want to escape as
quickly<00:04:13.970> as<00:04:14.209> possible<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:15.200> crowd<00:04:15.470> becomes

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
quickly as possible the crowd becomes

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.069 
quickly as possible the crowd becomes
dynamic<00:04:16.459> obstacles<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.630> feeling<00:04:17.959> is

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
dynamic obstacles and the feeling is

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.020 
dynamic obstacles and the feeling is
very<00:04:18.260> much<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.620> American<00:04:19.130> football<00:04:19.549> you

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
very much like American football you

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.820 
very much like American football you
really<00:04:20.330> could<00:04:20.630> get<00:04:20.810> knocked<00:04:21.080> over<00:04:21.289> if<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.620> run

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
really could get knocked over if you run

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.230 
really could get knocked over if you run
full<00:04:22.070> force<00:04:22.340> into<00:04:22.520> someone's<00:04:22.940> then<00:04:23.120> we're

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
full force into someone's then we're

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.790 
full force into someone's then we're
going<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.390> stay<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.810> right<00:04:23.840> here

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
going to stay to the right here

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.899 
going to stay to the right here
let's<00:04:24.979> head<00:04:25.159> towards<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.639> exit<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:28.550> we<00:04:28.699> being

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
let's head towards the exit are we being

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.600 
let's head towards the exit are we being
followed<00:04:29.530> okay<00:04:30.530> we're<00:04:31.159> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> show<00:04:31.550> you

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
followed okay we're going to show you

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.309 
followed okay we're going to show you
something<00:04:32.060> else<00:04:32.150> we<00:04:32.509> can<00:04:32.720> break<00:04:33.020> things

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
something else we can break things

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.230 
something else we can break things
dynamically<00:04:33.830> we<00:04:33.979> have<00:04:34.069> physics<00:04:34.550> we're<00:04:35.150> going

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
dynamically we have physics we're going

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.629 
dynamically we have physics we're going
to<00:04:35.300> create<00:04:35.509> a<00:04:35.569> barricade<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.460> thought<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.550> was

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
to create a barricade I thought that was

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.779 
to create a barricade I thought that was
coming<00:04:37.940> towards<00:04:38.180> me<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:39.229> quick<00:04:40.159> let's<00:04:40.460> get<00:04:40.639> to

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
coming towards me and quick let's get to

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.180 
coming towards me and quick let's get to
the<00:04:40.879> exit<00:04:43.479> okay<00:04:44.479> well<00:04:44.870> we've<00:04:45.020> been<00:04:45.190> cornered

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
the exit okay well we've been cornered

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.839 
the exit okay well we've been cornered
here<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:47.479> can<00:04:47.659> show<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.169> fight<00:04:48.440> now

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
here and I can show you the fight now

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.309 
here and I can show you the fight now
basically<00:04:49.849> this<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.240> very<00:04:50.449> realistic<00:04:50.840> fight

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
basically this is a very realistic fight

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.529 
basically this is a very realistic fight
system<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.009> can't<00:04:52.280> take<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.819> hundred<00:04:53.060> blows<00:04:53.360> to

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
system you can't take a hundred blows to

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.779 
system you can't take a hundred blows to
the<00:04:53.569> head<00:04:53.659> in<00:04:54.050> fact<00:04:54.319> you<00:04:54.860> can't<00:04:55.069> even<00:04:55.159> take<00:04:55.520> one

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
the head in fact you can't even take one

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.490 
the head in fact you can't even take one
so<00:04:56.539> what<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:56.810> want<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.080> do<00:04:57.169> is<00:04:57.259> take<00:04:57.440> a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
so what you want to do is take a

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.469 
so what you want to do is take a
defensive<00:04:57.740> pose<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.789> wait<00:04:58.969> for<00:04:59.270> an<00:04:59.330> opening

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
defensive pose and wait for an opening

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.330 
defensive pose and wait for an opening
in<00:04:59.960> the<00:04:59.990> enemy<00:05:00.379> just<00:05:00.620> like<00:05:00.740> his<00:05:00.949> stuff<00:05:01.159> is

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
in the enemy just like his stuff is

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.209 
in the enemy just like his stuff is
doing<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.849> use<00:05:02.389> that<00:05:02.419> timing<00:05:03.199> tool<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:03.979> your

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
doing and use that timing tool and your

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:11.689 
doing and use that timing tool and your
perfect<00:05:04.430> attack

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.929 

okay<00:05:12.699> well<00:05:13.120> unfortunately<00:05:13.479> we're<00:05:13.840> dead<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.939> i
