00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.029
 now youtube I'm pete seeger and 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.160
 Welcome back to the channel with 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.020
 news this time of neiva strike over 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.430
 all its launch date for 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.740
 premium users and for non-users 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.480
 as well as other things go through 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.250
 the live broadcast and some 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.990
 unofficial sources as well as 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.910
 swing changes that seem a lot to me 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.920
 most important ones that were applied on the day 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.150
 of yesterday March 18 then create the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.250
 launch of new strike for 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.930
 Premium users is March 25 and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.390
 for those who are not users 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.699
 premium and they bought expansion apart is 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.530
 on April 8 as you already know the game that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.140
 will have this expansion is the so-called 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.790
 assault on the aircraft carrier four maps a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.620
 new vehicle called jover kraft or 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.559
 hovercraft that they can drive in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.260
 earth or in water blah blah blah there is nothing 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.390
 different something different that yes that is 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.640
 we saw through the transmission that goes 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.350
 to have available guns and cannons 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.180
 like those of the pirates that you 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.540
 can use to shoot down aircraft 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.159
 Enemy boats or whatever you like 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.379
 it was also mentioned that there is 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.119
 sharks in the water that are not going to attack 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.060
 that you can not attack them but 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.229
 they are like an extra addition to the water this 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
 it was not seen with the live broadcast 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.140
 but nevertheless the managers of daisa 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.420
 Some 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 on several occasions they also mention 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.590
 that there will be històrics or easter eggs 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.180
 they say there is a very important one in a 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.369
 advance near a flag I know if 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.260
 you nothing moving away from her in 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.119
 any of the maps is not known although 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.369
 It could be I hope it's megalodon 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.290
 likewise things little sisters that 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.300
 you can find curiosities or things 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 similar as well as other types of 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.259
 evolution that may close doors and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 others now swing changes that 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.400
 they do not need to download anything they are changes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.530
 direct from server 1 can no longer 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 collect anti- aircraft mines that have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.220
 put that is good then where the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.720
 definitely put the enemy 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.940
 you can see and they can not be removed for 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.619
 save them now you can not equip either 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.440
 anti- aircraft mines with rocket launchers 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.450
 then now you sacrifice your ability and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.670
 is in that personal and you change it with the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.229
 of being a spammer of anti- area mines 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 two changes for the key and very 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.619
 important they can no longer do double 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.320
 and Berlin is to say throw one into the air 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.420
 reload point throw the second and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.070
 both rockets lead to collide with what 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.840
 would be the vehicle very similar with what 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.400
 I did in the video I beg you but that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 already parked this time the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 patch has already touched the boar 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.590
 also the damage was reduced from 34 to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.390
 30 why 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.640
 a death of four shots but yes 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 three missiles will leave you incapacitated 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.959
 that seems very good to me because 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.670
 Sincerely 34 points a certain death 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.709
 of three missiles was pretty 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.450
 unbearable a change also for the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.640
 anti-aircraft with its active missiles 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.799
 thanks has also been reduced on 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.349
 acquisition range is to say that so many 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.400
 I looked at the rocket to the left or 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.290
 to the right up or down 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.239
 to search for an aircraft before 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.310
 rocket he was smartly looking at some 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.170
 five degrees of separation are now two 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.790
 degrees of action have to be more 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 accurate and they will use this weapon 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.780
 equal changes of the active missile the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.970
 missile speed as such and of 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.430
 acquisition and intelligence itself is 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.739
 much smaller and on the other hand also the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 number of missiles are no longer two and two 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.129
 in the previous only two and one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.140
 depending on the server on which 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.329
 find another point for aircraft 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.489
 is that also the speed with which 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.220
 the flares are regenerated went from 25 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.400
 seconds to 20 seconds and for the sm or 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.769
 Sm inhibitor goes from 30 to 25 seconds 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.930
 also another change that I do not find the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.400
 reason why is that increased the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.109
 time in which you can recharge 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.280
 The active protection of vehicles is 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.400
 say that force field 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.530
 magical green step from 30 seconds to 35 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.720
 seconds seems unnecessary to me if 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.430
 you liked the acb j ms for 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.470
 some strange reason the damage has been 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.900
 improved to be a better damage to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.600
 several distances and in that way that does not 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.610
 be so stinky with 15 shots so 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400
 low then a change of the missiles a and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.410
 again apparently the increase that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 They were made too apparently 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.980
 then they reduced that increase to the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.380
 half are still better than it does 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.790
 a few months but only 50% of what 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.620
 they improved them in these two weeks 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.989
 also for all those who wish 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.400
 that the w will be too much better and for 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.800
 there would not be an advantage over 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.930
 users who have a dlc already downloaded 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.340
 the recoil to the sides or the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.110
 kicks and sides is greater for 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.200
 compare it with other machine guns like 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.330
 the m 249 omg 4 however follows 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.519
 looking more like an assault rifle and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.799
 is more balanced in a few words by 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.079
 last two changes about the missiles 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.050
 ground-air infantry is to say everything 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.300
 what are iglá stingers or even hb 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.530
 m2 that are baptized the damage of each 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.270
 Missile went from 45% damage to 35% damage 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.970
 it is a great gain at least 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.890
 extra and another positive change about 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.840
 its missiles is that the impact with which 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.260
 crashes into the aircraft has been 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.730
 reduced even more so that it does not turn 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.380
 dramatically the plane helicopter or what 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.390
 that they have in their hands without albur 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.920
 you who are dirty minded or who are 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.720
 guilty of something and there are the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.550
 new news of neiva strike and the 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.590
 changes that have applied the game to 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.180
 keep a certain balance I hope that 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.680
 serve you this informative video for 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.150
 that they know what to take care of or what 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.010
 use or not use in the last 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.570
 patch and if it's useful please give 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.070
 a rating to the video consider 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.140
 subscribe if by chance they are not 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.460
 and if they do not know whether to subscribe or can not 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.440
 review the other videos that I have in the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.210
 description not on the channel so that 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.040
 convince facebook and social networks 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.540
 twitter are always the description and 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.540
 see you in the next 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.849
 all right
