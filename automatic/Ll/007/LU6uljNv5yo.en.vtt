00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you're going to do is encase this by two

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
you're going to do is encase this by two
so<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.559> ahead<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.370> two

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and then we're going to build it up one

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930 
and then we're going to build it up one
more<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.879> make<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> too<00:00:57.629> tall<00:00:58.460> alright<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.760> now

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
do is put a sticky piston here and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
do is put a sticky piston here and
sticky<00:01:08.640> piston<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.180> we're<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.659> dig<00:01:09.900> out

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
sticky piston here we're gonna dig out

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080 
sticky piston here we're gonna dig out
two<00:01:10.260> blocks<00:01:10.530> right<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.490> sticky

two blocks right here put one sticky

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
two blocks right here put one sticky
piston<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> add<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
piston here and we're going to add a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.520 
piston here and we're going to add a
block<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.990> last<00:01:16.409> but

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
block here here and here and last but

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
block here here and here and last but
not<00:01:16.650> least<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> our

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
not least let's go ahead and put on our

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.859 
not least let's go ahead and put on our
redstone<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> put<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:20.189> two<00:01:20.580> three<00:01:21.180> four

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
redstone down and put one two three four

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
redstone down and put one two three four
just<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> our<00:01:23.520> machine

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
just like so and here is our machine

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
just like so and here is our machine
completed<00:01:25.049> now<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.710> we're<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.369> run

only on this block do not put it on any

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
only on this block do not put it on any
of<00:01:31.049> these<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.439> blocks<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:31.799> we're<00:01:31.920> gonna

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
of these other blocks but we're gonna

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
of these other blocks but we're gonna
put<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> running
