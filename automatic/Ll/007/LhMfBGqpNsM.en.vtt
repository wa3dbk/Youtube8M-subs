function the United States tell me the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
function the United States tell me the
difference<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.810> bottled

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
difference because I see on your bottled

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
difference because I see on your bottled
water<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> says<00:01:16.530> Alpine<00:01:16.890> spring<00:01:17.310> water<00:01:17.549> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
water it says Alpine spring water so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
water it says Alpine spring water so
good<00:01:18.000> difference<00:01:18.390> between<00:01:18.659> spring<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
good difference between spring water and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
good difference between spring water and
purified<00:01:20.430> simply<00:01:21.299> put<00:01:21.540> purified<00:01:22.229> water<00:01:22.500> comes

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
purified simply put purified water comes

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
purified simply put purified water comes
from<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.250> municipal<00:01:23.880> source<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.450> la<00:01:24.780> tap<00:01:25.140> water

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
from a municipal source a la tap water

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.160 
from a municipal source a la tap water
so<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.299> take<00:01:27.509> tap<00:01:27.869> water

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so what they do is they take tap water

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.420 
so what they do is they take tap water
they<00:01:28.380> run<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.650> through<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> reverse<00:01:29.130> osmosis

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
they run it through a reverse osmosis

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 
they run it through a reverse osmosis
system<00:01:29.970> reverse<00:01:30.810> osmosis

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
system reverse osmosis

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.380 
system reverse osmosis
strips<00:01:31.979> everything<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> water

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
strips everything out of the water

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
strips everything out of the water
taking<00:01:34.259> out<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> lot<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> natural<00:01:35.070> minerals

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that are in Crystal Geyser so when they

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
that are in Crystal Geyser so when they
strip<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.250> they'll<00:01:38.579> add<00:01:38.759> minerals<00:01:39.030> for

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
strip that out they'll add minerals for

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.090 
strip that out they'll add minerals for
taste<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> healthy
