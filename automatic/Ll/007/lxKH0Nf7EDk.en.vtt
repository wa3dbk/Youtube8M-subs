00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.500
 very good to everyone today I bring you a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.780
 interesting video that they just made 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 to launch the flip control center beta 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.769
 that is, the tweet that you can modify here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.340
 in this part the options that come out 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.460
 in him 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.940
 in the control center of the device 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 this beta is in the network that 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.200
 after leaving in the description is the same 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.470
 it was in the same repo as in the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.340
 beta activator is herpes 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.520
 chr pop since you have it installed and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.080
 let's go to changes or just the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 they look for example 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.680
 control 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.780
 control center as you see here is of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 ryan petric and we will install it 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.040
 is recharging the data and what 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.040
 we will start the springboard 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 wait for it to finish loading now 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.740
 let's see if we have any change 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.310
 as you see here is everything new we can 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.170
 go to settings 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:41.060
 spring goodbye are you are great very well 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.619
 very well let's see 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.619
 and good 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.940
 but what is a beta probably 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.850
 have many mistakes just been 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.510
 launched this do not know what is self 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.180
 block or author 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.380
 is for I think it's for when that is 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.270
 what I know 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 when the 200 when you leave with the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.060
 screen on and if it blocks alone what 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.319
 which refers to that and as you see here 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.519
 we can move governments to activate or 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.519
 turn off the sound 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.380
 flash 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.320
 how do you see airplane mode 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.480
 figuration or not 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.480
 share the internet on or vpn bluetooth 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 location 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.420
 the cell phone signal 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 the way not to disturb and those are all 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.569
 now let's go to settings and as much 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 It is probable that we have it here flip 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.470
 control center we enter and activate 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.530
 these are the switches that we have now 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.069
 available 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.069
 Y 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.950
 ah no 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.980
 Ivan are the numbers that put us here 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.980
 we can fit 26 there 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.360
 we can all fit 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.030
 4 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.990
 5 to 6 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.810
 but I think I'll leave it in 5 and 5 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.580
 it's fine very well and this is where 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.720
 we can example this is the first 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.910
 page can we move towards the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.319
 where we want it to be first 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.590
 this town I usually use 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.230
 much the rotation I put it up 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.080
 above 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.510
 and as you see there I have first the one of 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.069
 rotation is to put it in order to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.049
 all and that would be the flip control center 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.940
 beta I hope you liked the 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.959
 video if you liked remember to give it 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.329
 little hand up 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.329
 subscribe and until the next video
