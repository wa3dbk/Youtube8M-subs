hey today I'm going to show you the

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.830 
hey today I'm going to show you the
first<00:00:02.700> project<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.210> work<00:00:03.330> done<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
first project to work done with the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.780 
first project to work done with the
kinect<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.200> windows<00:00:04.319> using<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.460> depth

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
kinect for windows using the depth

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.849 
kinect for windows using the depth
camera<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.299> solve<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.600> problem<00:00:06.810> i<00:00:06.960> have<00:00:07.140> i<00:00:07.350> have

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
camera to solve a problem i have i have

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.799 
camera to solve a problem i have i have
a<00:00:08.010> projector<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.700> my<00:00:08.790> room<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.540> everyone

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
a projector in my room and as everyone

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.360 
a projector in my room and as everyone
who's<00:00:10.050> ever<00:00:10.200> walked<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.500> front<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:10.980> knows

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
who's ever walked in front of one knows

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.039 
who's ever walked in front of one knows
they<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.150> actually<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.420> pretty<00:00:12.630> blinding

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they can actually be pretty blinding

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.490 
they can actually be pretty blinding
connect<00:00:13.980> projector<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> computer<00:00:15.199> i'll<00:00:16.199> go

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
connect projector to a computer i'll go

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.840 
connect projector to a computer i'll go
over<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> send<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> voice<00:00:17.520> commands

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
over how to send all the voice commands

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.210 
over how to send all the voice commands
and<00:00:18.029> everything<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.600> infrared<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.010> next

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and everything with infrared in the next

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.210 
and everything with infrared in the next
video<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.320> computer

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
video so as you can see now the computer

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.269 
video so as you can see now the computer
screen<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.810> getting<00:00:25.350> blasted<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
screen is actually getting blasted on to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
screen is actually getting blasted on to
me<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.400> i<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:26.820> stand<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.599> without

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
me and i can really stand here without

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
me and i can really stand here without
covering<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.590> eyes<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.910> setup<00:00:30.420> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
covering my eyes so the setup that's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
covering my eyes so the setup that's
actually<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> i'm<00:00:32.009> taking<00:00:32.399> my

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
actually going on here is i'm taking my

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.720 
actually going on here is i'm taking my
laptop<00:00:32.910> camera<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> second<00:00:35.340> screen

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
laptop camera and on the second screen

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.990 
laptop camera and on the second screen
is<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.930> projector<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.160> over<00:00:38.700> here

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
is actually the projector so over here

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
is actually the projector so over here
on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.660> side<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:39.989> screen<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
on the right side of your screen is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
on the right side of your screen is
actually<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.250> upper<00:00:41.579> left<00:00:41.790> corner<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
actually the upper left corner of the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.799 
actually the upper left corner of the
image<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.379> getting<00:00:43.620> projected<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.809> so

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
image is getting projected at me so

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
image is getting projected at me so
problem<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.640> occlusion

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
problem i have here is one of occlusion

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
problem i have here is one of occlusion
which<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> same<00:00:48.930> thing<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.260> deal<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.530> in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
which is the same thing you deal with in

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.889 
which is the same thing you deal with in
graphics<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> time<00:00:50.660> when<00:00:51.660> there's<00:00:51.809> an

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
graphics all the time when there's an

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
graphics all the time when there's an
object<00:00:52.379> behind<00:00:52.559> another<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.579> graphics<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
object behind another in graphics you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.689 
object behind another in graphics you
don't<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.140> show<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.710> parts<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> back

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
don't want to show the parts of the back

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.000 
don't want to show the parts of the back
object<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.600> being<00:00:57.960> blocked<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> one

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
object they're being blocked by the one

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.639 
object they're being blocked by the one
in<00:00:59.100> front<00:00:59.250> it's<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.270> real<00:01:00.510> life<00:01:00.719> works<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in front it's not how real life works so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
in front it's not how real life works so
with<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.070> projector<00:01:02.699> i<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> same

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
with these projector i have the same

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
with these projector i have the same
thing<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> project<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.369> parts

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
thing I don't want to project the parts

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
thing I don't want to project the parts
of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> screen<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.810> am<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.619> blocking

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of the screen or I am where I'm blocking

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
of the screen or I am where I'm blocking
the<00:01:08.340> screen<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.780> won't<00:01:09.900> show

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the screen because now they won't show

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
the screen because now they won't show
anything<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> actual<00:01:11.430> screen<00:01:11.700> itself<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
anything on the actual screen itself and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
anything on the actual screen itself and
they're<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.869> blinding<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.369> order

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
they're just blinding here so in order

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
they're just blinding here so in order
to<00:01:14.549> solve<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> problem<00:01:15.180> using<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> Kinect

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to solve that problem using the Kinect

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
to solve that problem using the Kinect
show<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> works<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:18.409> connect

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
show you how that works now connect

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
show you how that works now connect
occlusion<00:01:20.189> vote<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.159> running<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
occlusion vote so now that's running you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
occlusion vote so now that's running you
see<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> diagnostic<00:01:24.750> stuff<00:01:24.990> over<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.380> right

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see the diagnostic stuff over on right

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
see the diagnostic stuff over on right
here<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.549> stand<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.970> front<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> without

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
here I can stand in front of it without

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.740 
here I can stand in front of it without
actually<00:01:28.049> getting<00:01:28.110> blinded<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:30.390> happens

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
actually getting blinded so what happens

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
actually getting blinded so what happens
is<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> walked<00:01:31.500> away<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.770> started<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is when I walked away and started the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.420 
is when I walked away and started the
program<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:33.000> command<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.140> Kinect<00:01:34.590> takes<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
program with command the Kinect takes a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.120 
program with command the Kinect takes a
picture<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.659> its<00:01:36.810> def<00:01:37.049> camera<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> then

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
picture with its def camera and then

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280 
picture with its def camera and then
stores<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> reference<00:01:39.210> frame<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
stores that as a reference frame so that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
stores that as a reference frame so that
first<00:01:40.829> image<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.909> purely<00:01:42.450> all

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
first image is one of just purely all

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230

the space in front of it it's now has a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.050 
the space in front of it it's now has a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
record of how far away the wall is from

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.660 
record of how far away the wall is from
the<00:01:48.180> Kinect<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.170> 30<00:01:49.740> times<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.130> second<00:01:50.520> when

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the Kinect so 30 times a second when

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
the Kinect so 30 times a second when
it's<00:01:50.790> updating<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> depth<00:01:51.630> image<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.229> then

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it's updating that depth image it then

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.399 
it's updating that depth image it then
says<00:01:53.369> oh<00:01:53.579> hey<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.540> infrared<00:01:54.869> bouncing

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
says oh hey I've got infrared bouncing

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.730 
says oh hey I've got infrared bouncing
off<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.799> object<00:01:56.180> me<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.560> and

off of this object me and going back and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
off of this object me and going back and
I'm<00:01:58.890> getting<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> depth<00:01:59.430> value<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.210> less

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I'm getting a depth value that's less

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.990 
I'm getting a depth value that's less
than<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.469> wall<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.250> am<00:02:02.430> closer<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
than the wall because I am closer to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.179 
than the wall because I am closer to
connect<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> wall<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> reference

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
connect then the wall and the reference

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.340 
connect then the wall and the reference
frame<00:02:05.430> was<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:06.329> he<00:02:06.390> needs<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.930> say<00:02:07.140> oh<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350

pixel<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> show<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.270> part<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pixel I don't want to show that part of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.920 
pixel I don't want to show that part of
the<00:02:09.959> screen<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:11.009> what<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> code<00:02:11.760> does<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the screen so what the code does is it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.069 
the screen so what the code does is it
a<00:02:12.989> black<00:02:13.349> pixel<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.819> white<00:02:15.659> screen

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
a black pixel on to this white screen

a black pixel on to this white screen
wherever<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.219> am<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.319> figuring<00:02:19.319> out<00:02:19.409> where<00:02:19.620> I

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
wherever I am in it figuring out where I

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.530 
wherever I am in it figuring out where I
am<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.219> it<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.760> little<00:02:21.090> more<00:02:21.209> complicated

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
am in it is a little more complicated

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.990 
am in it is a little more complicated
that's<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.829> black<00:02:23.219> rectangle<00:02:23.760> over

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
that's what the black rectangle over

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.920 
that's what the black rectangle over
here<00:02:24.150> show<00:02:24.379> it's<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.620> same<00:02:26.150> idea<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.420> what

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
here show it's the same idea as what

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.910 
here show it's the same idea as what
you're<00:02:28.049> seeing<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.409> left<00:02:28.560> side<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.859> your

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you're seeing on the left side of your

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
you're seeing on the left side of your
screen<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.609> color<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.599> my<00:02:30.989> laptop

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
screen with the color so my laptop

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.589 
screen with the color so my laptop
camera<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.340> field<00:02:32.609> of<00:02:32.760> view<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:33.180> actually

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
camera the field of view is actually

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.589 
camera the field of view is actually
bigger<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.040> projector<00:02:35.670> screen<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
bigger than the projector screen in that

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.420 
bigger than the projector screen in that
field<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.930> view<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.230> need<00:02:37.859> that<00:02:37.889> to<00:02:38.159> be<00:02:38.189> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
field of view I need that to be a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.089 
field of view I need that to be a
one-to-one<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.989> what<00:02:40.530> I'm<00:02:40.620> basically<00:02:40.889> doing

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
one-to-one so what I'm basically doing

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.759 
one-to-one so what I'm basically doing
is<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.879> black<00:02:42.239> outer<00:02:42.569> rectangle<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
is this black outer rectangle that

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.800 
is this black outer rectangle that
represents<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> entire<00:02:44.639> field<00:02:45.389> of<00:02:45.569> view<00:02:45.689> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
represents the entire field of view of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.659 
represents the entire field of view of
the<00:02:45.989> connect<00:02:46.349> that's<00:02:46.859> sitting<00:02:47.159> on<00:02:47.250> top<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
the connect that's sitting on top of the

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.360 
the connect that's sitting on top of the
projector<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.109> need<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.319> do<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.709> buy<00:02:50.040> in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
projector what I need to do is buy in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.860 
projector what I need to do is buy in
order<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.639> find<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.879> one-to-one<00:02:51.419> I<00:02:51.599> need<00:02:51.780> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
order to find a one-to-one I need to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.800 
order to find a one-to-one I need to
find<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.260> part<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.450> kinect<00:02:54.450> field<00:02:54.659> of

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
find the part of the kinect field of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.869 
find the part of the kinect field of
view<00:02:54.959> where<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.799> actual<00:02:56.129> projector<00:02:56.609> screen

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
view where the actual projector screen

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.129 
view where the actual projector screen
is<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.900> four<00:02:58.409> sliders<00:02:58.889> below<00:02:59.489> the

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
is so the four sliders below the

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.449 
is so the four sliders below the
rectangles<00:03:01.139> those<00:03:01.560> allow<00:03:01.829> me<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.129> basically

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
rectangles those allow me to basically

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.030 
rectangles those allow me to basically
re<00:03:02.790> side<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.389> that<00:03:03.540> inner<00:03:03.930> black<00:03:04.379> rectangle

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
re side is that inner black rectangle

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.059 
re side is that inner black rectangle
and<00:03:05.159> move<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.909> around<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.139> it<00:03:07.530> perfectly

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
and move it around so that it perfectly

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.569 
and move it around so that it perfectly
matches<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.299> screen<00:03:09.930> behind<00:03:10.379> me<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.370> as<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
matches the screen behind me so as you

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.940 
matches the screen behind me so as you
can<00:03:11.639> see<00:03:11.909> when<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.480> move<00:03:12.750> here<00:03:13.169> off<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.739> very

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
can see when I move here off to the very

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.119 
can see when I move here off to the very
edge<00:03:14.189> of<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> screen<00:03:14.669> I'm<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.349> well

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
edge of the screen I'm now you know well

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.099 
edge of the screen I'm now you know well
within<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.849> entire<00:03:18.269> connect<00:03:18.659> field<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.989> view

within the entire connect field of view

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.830 
within the entire connect field of view
but<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.489> line<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.540> inner

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.719 
but I'm just on the line for that inner
black<00:03:22.169> rectangle<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.949> that's<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.579> part

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
black rectangle and that's the part

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.819 
black rectangle and that's the part
where<00:03:23.909> I<00:03:23.940> want<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> begin<00:03:24.470> drawing<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> black

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.920 
where I want to begin drawing the black
pixels<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.970> will<00:03:27.090> from<00:03:27.209> over<00:03:27.449> here<00:03:27.479> I'm

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
pixels this will from over here I'm

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.929 
pixels this will from over here I'm
still<00:03:28.199> being<00:03:28.349> seen<00:03:28.620> by<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.829> connects<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.729> I

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
still being seen by the connects but I

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.089 
still being seen by the connects but I
want<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.180> do<00:03:30.329> anything<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.439> actual<00:03:31.709> screen

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
want to do anything to the actual screen

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.199 
want to do anything to the actual screen
yet<00:03:32.479> that<00:03:33.479> way<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.870> maps<00:03:34.109> 11<00:03:34.790> as<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.909> can<00:03:36.030> see

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
yet that way it maps 11 as you can see

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.879 
yet that way it maps 11 as you can see
it<00:03:36.329> still<00:03:36.540> needs<00:03:36.750> some<00:03:36.959> optimization<00:03:37.739> work

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
it still needs some optimization work

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.490 
it still needs some optimization work
because<00:03:38.280> they<00:03:39.120> frame<00:03:39.569> rate<00:03:39.750> leg<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.260> little

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
because they frame rate leg a little

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.909 
because they frame rate leg a little
much<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.449> what<00:03:42.449> it's<00:03:42.569> doing<00:03:42.629> every<00:03:43.290> frame<00:03:43.650> is

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
much so what it's doing every frame is

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.830 
much so what it's doing every frame is
basically<00:03:44.370> scanning<00:03:44.879> through<00:03:44.909> that<00:03:45.629> inner

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
basically scanning through that inner

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.530 
basically scanning through that inner
black<00:03:46.109> rectangle<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:46.889> any<00:03:47.639> pixel<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.329> comes

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
black rectangle and any pixel that comes

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.629 
black rectangle and any pixel that comes
up<00:03:48.689> closer<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.189> connecting<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
up closer to the connecting the

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.520 
up closer to the connecting the
reference<00:03:50.939> frame<00:03:51.150> that's<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.079> ones<00:03:52.259> that<00:03:52.439> it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
reference frame that's the ones that it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.339 
reference frame that's the ones that it
starts<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.829> paint<00:03:53.930> because<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.079> was<00:03:55.199> already

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
starts to paint because I was already

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.990 
starts to paint because I was already
then<00:03:55.560> painting<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.069> screen<00:03:56.340> sided<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.970> a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
then painting the screen sided have a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.140 
then painting the screen sided have a
little<00:03:57.209> fun<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:58.259> what<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.040> see<00:03:59.220> here<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.579> about

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
little fun so what you see here is about

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.610 
little fun so what you see here is about
color<00:04:00.449> mode<00:04:01.759> so<00:04:02.759> this<00:04:03.060> will<00:04:03.180> slowly<00:04:03.959> oscillate

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
color mode so this will slowly oscillate

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.399 
color mode so this will slowly oscillate
through<00:04:04.650> rainbow<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.359> fun<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.379> just

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
through rainbow just for fun and I just

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.890 
through rainbow just for fun and I just
want<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.919> a<00:04:08.129> little<00:04:08.430> more<00:04:08.549> intense<00:04:08.909> this

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
want to be a little more intense this

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.020 
want to be a little more intense this
will<00:04:10.109> actually<00:04:10.229> just<00:04:10.680> start<00:04:10.889> strobing<00:04:11.459> this

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
will actually just start strobing this

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.680 
will actually just start strobing this
is<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.329> little<00:04:12.599> much<00:04:12.859> epilepsy<00:04:13.859> warning

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.860 

so<00:04:17.320> that's<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.680> for<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.820> actually<00:04:19.420> coated

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so that's it for this I actually coated

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.950 
so that's it for this I actually coated
this<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:20.560> basically<00:04:21.220> off<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.960> tutorials

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
this just basically off of the tutorials

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840 
this just basically off of the tutorials

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
that the kinect for windows guys and the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.550 
that the kinect for windows guys and the
developers<00:04:25.300> all<00:04:25.540> put<00:04:25.750> out<00:04:25.870> there's<00:04:26.410> some

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
developers all put out there's some

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.430 
developers all put out there's some

all<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.370> source<00:04:36.670> code<00:04:36.850> once<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.210> comment

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
all the source code once I comment

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.630 
all the source code once I comment
through<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.870> all<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.260> these<00:04:38.920> stuff<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.430> all

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
through it all but these stuff is all

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.880 
through it all but these stuff is all
very<00:04:40.030> closely<00:04:40.510> connected<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.740> going<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
very closely connected so it's going to

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.690 
very closely connected so it's going to
take<00:04:41.980> me<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.160> little<00:04:42.250> while<00:04:42.340> I'm<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.610> through

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
take me a little while I'm going through

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.440 
take me a little while I'm going through
that<00:04:43.020> yeah<00:04:44.020> thanks
