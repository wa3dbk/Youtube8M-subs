00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello good afternoon numbers ramón catalá 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.750
 work for the company serveis 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040
 integrals cata we are a company that 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.799
 we make installations of all kinds 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.600
 basically for domestic and local use 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.129
 commercial and in this case I come to 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.270
 talk to you with collaborations with 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.070
 habitissimo of what they are in 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.320
 local signage 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.850
 commercial as for private use 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.310
 how can it be homes and flats 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 today we basically promote two types of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.030
 products that are on the market one is 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.419
 the rock wool and other is complex 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.550
 acoustic or viscoelastic disc sheet 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.350
 It protects high density and lower 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.239
 decibels of the noise they produce 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.370
 local and that isolates the in this case from 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.620
 the neighbors or another local that gives us 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.129
 discomfort whenever you keep in mind 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.339
 that this is placed just below or between 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.260
 basically two layers of the 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.019
 false ceilings where you have to lower the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.999
 ceiling between 10 centimeters to lower it 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.460
 which are noises and isolate concrete 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.809
 completely what are the neighbors or 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.370
 in this case in local neighbors 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.990
 where the noise was occurring 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 as 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.130
 as different products from the market 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.650
 we have plates of higher density of wool 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.240
 Here, obviously, there is also the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.160
 nit of micro which is another kind of 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.650
 product that gives very good result and 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.600
 then we have different types of what 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 they are filter sheets of filters 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 both for domestic use and for use 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 of premises always always always 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 we ask to do a decibel study is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.100
 that gives a lot of noise and is a study of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.750
 recording 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 must be said under a concept always 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
 what is the engineer who marks the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 guidelines of the work to be done in the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.550
 local or in the house in this case 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.410
 you always have to do a study 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.090
 customized for each customer and see 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.860
 the needs that you have that the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.690
 client looks at the products that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.970
 seek to find in the market for it 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.369
 we always ask a professional who can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.350
 assist the client in the visit to the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.310
 local or on the floor and well this would be a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.530
 little to big right is the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.150
 explanation of what the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 business premises organizations or 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.210
 of homes to give thanks habitissimo 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.930
 for the collaboration of having been able to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.930
 make this video
