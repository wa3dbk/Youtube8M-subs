doing something and now I'm figuring out

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.420 
doing something and now I'm figuring out
how<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.160> thing<00:02:11.430> works<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.010> feels

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
how this thing works so this this feels

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.430 
how this thing works so this this feels
kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.849> better<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.660> especially<00:02:16.319> with

the four star let's see who else we can
get<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.310> guess<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.630> get

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
get you know it I guess we can also get

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.360 
get you know it I guess we can also get
the<00:02:22.170> Hulk<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.739> well<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:24.950> well<00:02:25.950> what<00:02:26.220> does

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the Hulk as well as well what does

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.660 
the Hulk as well as well what does
limited<00:02:27.150> tes<00:02:28.079> stand<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.859> I<00:02:28.889> don't<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
limited tes stand for I don't get that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
limited tes stand for I don't get that
I'm<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.269> gonna<00:02:30.420> buy<00:02:30.660> all<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.019> them<00:02:31.290> because

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'm not gonna buy all of them because

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.490 
I'm not gonna buy all of them because
obviously<00:02:32.660> there's<00:02:33.660> no<00:02:33.810> point<00:02:34.109> for<00:02:34.290> me<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
obviously there's no point for me I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.319 
obviously there's no point for me I
guess<00:02:34.680> there's<00:02:34.859> four<00:02:35.100> star<00:02:35.340> Hawkeye<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:36.090> well

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329

definitely definitely you know I think I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.310 
definitely definitely you know I think I
should<00:03:34.220> spend<00:03:34.520> until<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.210> have<00:03:35.330> 500<00:03:35.960> units

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
should spend until we have 500 units

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.740 
should spend until we have 500 units
left<00:03:36.560> then<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.120> out<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.360> there

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
left then I can get out of there

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:47.470 
left then I can get out of there
all<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.800> got<00:03:39.980> duplicate<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:47.270> know<00:03:47.360> why

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
all right we got duplicate you know why

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.830 
all right we got duplicate you know why
I<00:03:47.540> shouldn't<00:03:47.960> be<00:03:48.110> too<00:03:48.260> greedy<00:03:49.360> but<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.390> heard

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
I shouldn't be too greedy but I heard

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.370 
I shouldn't be too greedy but I heard
some<00:03:51.110> other<00:03:51.260> fliers<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.740> first<00:03:52.070> two<00:03:52.280> spins<00:03:53.380> if

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
some other fliers the first two spins if

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.280 
some other fliers the first two spins if
you<00:03:54.530> do<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.800> now<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.610> will<00:03:55.820> be<00:03:56.060> able<00:03:56.210> to<00:03:56.570> get<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
you do it now you will be able to get a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
you do it now you will be able to get a
four<00:03:57.830> star<00:03:59.170> but<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.200> parent<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.860> know<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.190> you

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
four star but a parent you know if you

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.800 
four star but a parent you know if you
lay<00:04:01.460> if<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.700> leave<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.030> later<00:04:02.210> on<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.600> might

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
lay if you leave it later on you might

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.510 
lay if you leave it later on you might
not<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.260> I'll<00:04:03.350> let<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.830> that's<00:04:04.040> actually<00:04:04.490> very

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
not and I'll let it that's actually very

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.030 
not and I'll let it that's actually very
close<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.390> hypothesis<00:04:06.170> as<00:04:06.350> well<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:06.980> I

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
close to the hypothesis as well but I

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.250 
close to the hypothesis as well but I
don't<00:04:07.100> know<00:04:07.310> exactly<00:04:07.850> I'm<00:04:08.390> waiting<00:04:08.870> for<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:09.110> lot

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
don't know exactly I'm waiting for a lot

letting it spin if you're wondering I'm
getting<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.450> bit<00:05:17.630> greedy<00:05:17.930> I'm<00:05:18.140> thinking<00:05:18.590> yeah

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
getting a bit greedy I'm thinking yeah

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.969 
getting a bit greedy I'm thinking yeah
maybe<00:05:19.130> we<00:05:19.370> should<00:05:19.400> spin<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.630> UM<00:05:20.870> we<00:05:21.740> should

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
maybe we should spin it to UM we should

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.140 
maybe we should spin it to UM we should
buy<00:05:22.160> one<00:05:22.430> more<00:05:24.190> all<00:05:25.190> right<00:05:25.340> another<00:05:25.550> 2<00:05:25.820> star

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
buy one more all right another 2 star

buy one more all right another 2 star
Captain<00:05:26.630> America<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:28.100> is<00:05:28.160> a<00:05:28.340> duplicate<00:05:31.390> all

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
Captain America this is a duplicate all

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.820 
Captain America this is a duplicate all
right<00:05:32.510> we<00:05:32.600> got<00:05:32.750> Last<00:05:33.020> Stand<00:05:33.260> that's<00:05:33.560> what<00:05:33.800> I

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
right we got Last Stand that's what I

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.350 
right we got Last Stand that's what I
want<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.220> look<00:05:34.370> at<00:05:34.520> as<00:05:34.640> well<00:05:34.820> because<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.210> don't

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
want to look at as well because I don't

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.180 
want to look at as well because I don't
know<00:05:35.450> what<00:05:35.630> lost<00:05:35.840> an<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.320> so<00:05:36.710> we<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:36.890> look<00:05:37.039> at

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
know what lost an is so we can look at

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.219 
know what lost an is so we can look at
that<00:05:37.340> together<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.360> guess<00:05:38.900> there<00:05:39.110> is

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
that together so I guess there is

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.749 
that together so I guess there is
something<00:05:39.440> good<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:39.800> can

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
something good that can

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.239 
something good that can
but<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:41.869> is<00:05:42.139> pretty<00:05:42.439> much<00:05:42.649> it<00:05:42.709> I'm<00:05:43.009> not<00:05:43.129> gonna

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249 
but that is pretty much it I'm not gonna

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.939 
but that is pretty much it I'm not gonna
spend<00:05:43.580> any<00:05:43.699> more<00:05:43.879> there's<00:05:44.319> six<00:05:45.319> hundred<00:05:45.649> units

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
spend any more there's six hundred units

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.399 
spend any more there's six hundred units
long<00:05:46.159> I'm<00:05:46.639> gonna<00:05:46.849> keep<00:05:47.059> it<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.869> know<00:05:47.989> I<00:05:48.020> think

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
long I'm gonna keep it you know I think

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.859 
long I'm gonna keep it you know I think
that<00:05:48.679> the<00:05:48.860> units<00:05:49.159> were<00:05:49.279> more<00:05:49.639> valuable<00:05:50.539> than

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:50.869 
that the units were more valuable than

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:53.739 
that the units were more valuable than
whatever<00:05:51.649> all<00:05:52.399> right<00:05:52.429> we're<00:05:53.330> gonna<00:05:53.419> go<00:05:53.569> down

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
whatever all right we're gonna go down

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.029 
whatever all right we're gonna go down
in<00:05:53.929> here<00:05:54.080> we're<00:05:54.259> gonna<00:05:54.349> look<00:05:54.439> at<00:05:54.649> Captain

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
in here we're gonna look at Captain

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.269 
in here we're gonna look at Captain
America<00:05:55.339> lost<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:55.939> and<00:05:56.479> it<00:05:57.259> is<00:05:57.589> what<00:05:58.009> does<00:05:58.159> it

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
America lost and and it is what does it

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.790 
America lost and and it is what does it
do

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
do

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.369 
do
chance<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:00.979> perfectly<00:06:01.519> block<00:06:02.389> all<00:06:02.689> damage

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:03.379 
chance to perfectly block all damage

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.659 
chance to perfectly block all damage
increase<00:06:04.099> by<00:06:04.279> 10%<00:06:04.610> for<00:06:05.269> every<00:06:05.300> 1%<00:06:05.689> health<00:06:06.259> loss

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
increase by 10% for every 1% health loss

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.269 
increase by 10% for every 1% health loss
providing<00:06:07.669> hope<00:06:07.849> when<00:06:08.149> cap<00:06:08.330> needs<00:06:09.019> it<00:06:09.439> most

providing hope when cap needs it most
all<00:06:10.999> right<00:06:11.149> that<00:06:11.360> means<00:06:11.479> when<00:06:11.899> he's<00:06:12.169> about<00:06:12.319> to
