00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.400
 i 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.930
 Y 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.880
 in Panama there are a lot of people who 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.820
 lacks this vital liquid that is 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.950
 suitable for consumption 21 percent of the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.439
 Panamanian population does not have access to 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.360
 heavy water and in almost four million 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.340
 people we are talking about a million 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 of people who do not have access to water 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.370
 we are eliminating the use of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.050
 chlorine that is harmful to health and that 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.120
 on the contrary the chlorine to be filled with 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.600
 organic matter can originate 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.000
 harmful substances that do not benefit 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.129
 to the human and in this case we are 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.159
 working with a system that 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.940
 Instantly eliminate the organisms 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.070
 the water has no flavor to explored and no 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.700
 we are producing a pollution 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.700
 with chemicals 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.560
 my project is the portable system of 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.200
 purification of water with emphasis on 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.360
 rural areas of Panama and one account 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.390
 box received now from a decanter one 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.030
 filter series and finally a light 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.790
 ultraviolet which is responsible for 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.410
 eliminate the microbiological part that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.080
 is in the water by the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.910
 structure of DNA the water passes through a 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.800
 tube to the bottom of the decanter to 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.900
 purge the sediments by a mesh 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 geotextile to separate the solids 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.740
 light is filtered by a sand of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.080
 quartz fine sand mineral coal 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.210
 cellulose and activated coconut charcoal for 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.920
 eliminate fine particles and taste a 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.200
 Ultraviolet lamp destroys 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.060
 organisms present in the water us 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.920
 we did an economic analysis of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.979
 project and the project is in around 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.869
 of the 400 452 an extremely useful life 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.720
 extensive and the filters can be washed 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.460
 every time they get saturated with the matter 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.420
 physical so if it's economically 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.729
 viable and I think that people can 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.649
 save a lot of money using this 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.370
 purification system and in addition to 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.860
 money 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.630
 they will invest to obtain a quality 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.150
 of life is a project totally 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.860
 Economically friendly 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:15.230
 viable and it offers us that we have water not 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.840
 only in quantity but that the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 quality of it every day be better 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.030
 for all our vital process since 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.500
 water does not only intervene in 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
 our daily chores but that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
 is part of a series of processes 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.520
 metabolites of our organism that are 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.520
 inherent in life
