00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and I think there's a team of two coming

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.249 
and I think there's a team of two coming
up<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.570> hopefully<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.049> people

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
up here hopefully it's two people

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.050 
up here hopefully it's two people
chasing<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.860> each<00:01:46.979> other<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
chasing like each other but it might be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.539 
chasing like each other but it might be
a<00:01:48.149> team<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.320> suck

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
a team of two which would really suck

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.310 
a team of two which would really suck
