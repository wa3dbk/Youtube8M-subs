00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.629
 finds herself today for a small 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.059
 video commented on dofus 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.440
 so we end up finally after two 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.390
 weeks of absence since the first 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.140
 week I had no pc and the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.840
 second week 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.970
 a numericable internet failure I do not 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.000
 you do not honestly advise him and 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.699
 so I managed to play 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.730
 space of vars one on silhouettes handle 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.430
 I spent two skulls at pea so I 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.490
 could make 51 million and as you the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.520
 see all my team is down to the role 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.990
 wind so it means that I could 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.060
 all the abos to one year 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.730
 so for a year I 'll be quiet 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.290
 no subscription or anything we will be well 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.810
 quiet so I hope that you 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.600
 will please because there will be a lot more 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.870
 a lot more videos of dust off for 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.440
 the characters is here today we are 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.990
 found in frigost at the village for 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.259
 xp my team I took the coronation they 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 want 150.2 that I had transfer for 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.259
 the gamma and everything is so I took my 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.149
 team and I will xp them to cha cha and 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.909
 augÃ© lycans like that at the same time that's me 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.159
 drop to engrave royal keys 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.310
 muthe and then be able to resell them by 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.789
 after and do the stuff higher up the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.530
 therefore want asin bein bein I 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.289
 do not learn it because it's on the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.929
 account ca cries but I saw it 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.060
 xpx 2 Thursday was exploring after so did not 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.770
 do not worry so there is a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.460
 small group of chefs them 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 level 5 199 with stars finally with 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.640
 a star 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.259
 so that explains the 306 miles you 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.780
 see it's not bad it's much better 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.729
 that it's a lot more profitable than this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.179
 that I did before with the cases this 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.979
 cargo 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.719
 because it was getting way too long 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.729
 mount the map 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.679
 she is a little shit so I'm preparing 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.819
 all the characters I will try to you 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.020
 put normal vision on others 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.610
 chars 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.519
 for the cra the ring i will put you the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.099
 screen so in the end at the end of the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.080
 video but I passed them first in 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.080
 three grunes you go the treatise of 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 big chance and the visual admits the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.549
 secondly 18 street and when I had 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.160
 bought but without ring apart actually the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.349
 streets were at this May 9 no to 4 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.769
 million 3 leaving so I had thrown 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.590
 above 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.620
 and surprised by wanting to resell them the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.510
 80 young people who will stay and I saw 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 that the price had doubled so 9 million 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.379
 so I was able to directly reach the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.849
 51 million in 2 exo so it was 6 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.420
 million four hundred and eighty thousand 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.150
 for abu a character a year doing 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.799
 your offer in there look so you 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 go in the green I want some ogrines 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.829
 did you create my offer I took 36 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.359
 me lo green for a year 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.620
 I took for 180 kama units so 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.780
 it made 6 million four hundred 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 eighty thousand and in the space of 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 not even a day you already had them 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.319
 36000 to the green on your account and so 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 I had more than abu all the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.250
 accounts and so here's the result I 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.590
 am super father i have more subscriptions 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.389
 to do what will allow me to have 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.239
 full of range have you make videos 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.160
 so I'm really happy 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.769
 I'm really pleased that I 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.069
 can play so quietly 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.709
 if you calculate well I saved 416 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.430
 euros subscription if I had to buy 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.079
 all subscriptions a year so the average 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.470
 the ogrine system is still 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.209
 very practical 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.640
 after I would put you a screen of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.340
 matty lie in fashion 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.870
 swag to see if you like it if it does not 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.280
 You do not like the limit I certainly 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.350
 changed color later but 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.420
 personally I like it 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:07.260
 really so after after I am 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.940
 really sorry but the series on the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.280
 heroic server is a little bit fallen to 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.150
 water there were several other deaths 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.709
 two players who are desisted and me 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.100
 who just died not long ago 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.740
 with my friend it's Russian 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.050
 so if you have series ideas 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.260
 telly in me because frankly there to 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.560
 share the team and some parceum 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.590
 maybe with ecstasy again I would have 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.630
 really nothing else to you propose 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.770
 so tell me what you what you 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.930
 want 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 I think xp mathy maffre eagles 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.970
 to about level 120 and I'll go 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.400
 farm the royal mouthe 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.710
 after hoping that within a year my 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.470
 team may be surely 199 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.360
 so I will evolve with you on video 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.310
 good not all the details because there is 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.510
 still some who can be 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.540
 annoying enough that there I find the 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.220
 fight a little long at amap crate 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.919
 I did not choose the right moment for you 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.669
 make the video but hey we can not do anything 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.440
 So for the next gamma technical 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.979
 at the same time as jx playmate ims and 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.020
 alright i'll show you the craft you 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.290
 drop and djelic feathers ans 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.680
 wild cat cat hair and with that I 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.650
 are going to craf the keys of roy hellmuth so 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.870
 which consist of the aisne upright 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.970
 war foul legendary name forgiveness 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.200
 a whole food horn of war a 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.560
 food ear tone mounts 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.780
 moot an obsidian a feather of genius 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.490
 when an aspen wood and a wool 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.950
 all food is a bit of chacha 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.170
 unemployment and so the hundred is selling 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.440
 if my memories are good a million and 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:54.640
 a few or so so I think 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.590
 by then ten levels 120 with my team 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.710
 she's helping turquois I think that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:05.410
 I will have drop and maybe 2000 or 3000 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:08.790
 more me gely when so with the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.230
 benefits if I manage to get by 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.010
 because the obsidian resources and 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.110
 transvaal quite expensive I think maybe 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.290
 to make 3000 key so that's done if you 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.540
 calculate 30 million, or maybe not 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.630
 keep a hundred for king keep farm 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.310
 hellmuth we'll see but so 30 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.970
 million for staff my characters I 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:39.580
 think it's pretty reasonable and 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:40.900
 so here's sorry for the white I 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.870
 was thinking what could I 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.780
 do you like video head of the coliseum 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.800
 with characters of the team has in addition they 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.170
 want if you like it and after bassil 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.890
 and gamma are there at the limit why 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:00.100
 pvp flowing to scales 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.960
 that would be nice and tell me too 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.720
 I hesitate to change the oysters 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.300
 of the team ride because 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.490
 now it's more useful in 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.400
 a team of maybe replace it with 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.670
 a haka flip or fewer characters 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.310
 support you to see tell me in 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.400
 the comments so I hope this 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.970
 video will please you and excuse me again 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.410
 of my absence for two weeks but 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.220
 I really could not make videos 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:32.530
 were all against me 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.140
 so that's the fight will soon be 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.860
 finish 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.840
 and so the characters have exposed how much 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.970
 we have eight minutes this name five minutes 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:48.430
 it's a bit long so it's for the 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:52.070
 people are shipping 300000 no eu 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:56.510
 no, so the team is usually 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.440
 level 87 to 81 8 except the sacrifice and 

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.480
 vitality 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.690
 it does not explain as fast as the 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.280
 others so here I hope the video 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.450
 you will have pleased and I tell you to the 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.450
 next ball everyone
