00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
new collagen new collagen puffs things

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
new collagen new collagen puffs things
up<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> allows<00:01:26.700> scars<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.330> improve<00:01:27.630> after<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
up that allows scars to improve after a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
up that allows scars to improve after a
series<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> treatments<00:01:28.860> scars<00:01:29.610> begin<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> fade

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
series of treatments scars begin to fade

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
series of treatments scars begin to fade
and<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.290> notice<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> study<00:01:32.100> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and so what we notice in this study in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
and so what we notice in this study in
this<00:01:32.490> pilot<00:01:32.790> study<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> scars<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this pilot study is that the scars that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.280 
this pilot study is that the scars that
were<00:01:34.619> resurfaced<00:01:35.329> right<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:36.479> suture<00:01:36.810> removal

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
were resurfaced right at suture removal

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
were resurfaced right at suture removal
within<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:38.009> weeks<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.490> suture<00:01:38.790> removal

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
within two weeks of suture removal

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.569 
within two weeks of suture removal
dramatically<00:01:40.229> improved<00:01:40.740> after<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.159> series<00:01:41.549> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
dramatically improved after a series of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.190 
dramatically improved after a series of
five<00:01:41.970> resurfacing<00:01:42.600> sessions<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
five resurfacing sessions with the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
five resurfacing sessions with the
