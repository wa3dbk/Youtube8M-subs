awesome<00:03:40.930> system<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.590> wish<00:03:41.770> we<00:03:41.890> could<00:03:42.040> see

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
awesome system and I wish we could see

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.100 
awesome system and I wish we could see
it<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.400> action<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:43.600> we<00:03:43.690> have<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> very

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
it in action actually we have a very

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.660 
it in action actually we have a very
similar<00:03:44.320> system<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.950> sitting<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.220> our<00:03:45.430> demo

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
similar system just sitting on our demo

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.890 
similar system just sitting on our demo
floor<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.210> you<00:03:46.300> just<00:03:46.420> want<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.600> turn<00:03:46.780> around

behind<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.590> check<00:03:47.770> it<00:03:47.890> check<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.280> out

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.700 

alright<00:03:55.090> so<00:03:55.150> we<00:03:55.360> have<00:03:55.390> essentially<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
alright so we have essentially the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.170 
alright so we have essentially the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
system you built here Adam maybe you

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.880 
system you built here Adam maybe you
could<00:03:58.300> explain<00:03:58.390> what's<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.350> same<00:03:59.530> about<00:03:59.770> it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
could explain what's the same about it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.470 
could explain what's the same about it
and<00:04:00.010> what's<00:04:00.130> different<00:04:00.250> well<00:04:00.910> I've<00:04:01.090> kept<00:04:01.390> the

a<00:04:10.450> little<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.780> you'll<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:11.170> at<00:04:11.290> GTX<00:04:11.710> 660

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
a little bit you'll see it's at GTX 660

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.010 
a little bit you'll see it's at GTX 660

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
don't have to liquid cooler in here so

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.390 
don't have to liquid cooler in here so
there's<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> couple<00:04:17.710> things<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.190> have

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
there's a couple things that I have

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.460 
there's a couple things that I have
opted<00:04:18.820> out<00:04:18.910> for<00:04:19.210> right<00:04:19.510> now<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.960> changed<00:04:20.320> and

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
opted out for right now and changed and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.440 
opted out for right now and changed and
the<00:04:20.530> other<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.830> showed<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.190> guys<00:04:21.450> monitors

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
the other one I showed you guys monitors

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.820 
the other one I showed you guys monitors
a<00:04:22.480> little<00:04:22.690> bit<00:04:22.780> different<00:04:23.050> monitor<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.770> a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
a little bit different monitor is a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.040 
a little bit different monitor is a
little<00:04:24.040> different<00:04:24.400> it's<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.670> basis<00:04:25.300> BG<00:04:25.660> 2<00:04:25.810> for

that's<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.310> 144<00:04:27.940> Hertz<00:04:28.180> panel<00:04:28.570> which<00:04:28.690> means<00:04:28.930> it

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
that's a 144 Hertz panel which means it

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.960 
that's a 144 Hertz panel which means it
refreshes<00:04:29.560> twice<00:04:29.830> as<00:04:29.980> fast<00:04:30.220> as<00:04:30.430> traditional

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
refreshes twice as fast as traditional

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.970 
refreshes twice as fast as traditional
display<00:04:31.180> yes<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.110> twice<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> frame<00:04:32.800> to

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
display yes you see twice a frame to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.740 
display yes you see twice a frame to
someone<00:04:33.280> else<00:04:33.460> all<00:04:33.820> right<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.300> know<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.420> huge

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
someone else all right you know a huge

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.980 
someone else all right you know a huge
tactical<00:04:35.020> edge<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.530> games<00:04:35.710> like<00:04:36.630> nice<00:04:37.630> nice

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
tactical edge and games like nice nice

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.520 
tactical edge and games like nice nice
so<00:04:38.260> essentially<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.750> PC<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.930> built<00:04:41.260> is

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
so essentially the PC that you built is

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.170 
so essentially the PC that you built is
just<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.890> lot<00:04:42.040> more<00:04:42.220> powerful<00:04:42.490> than<00:04:42.640> it's

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
just a lot more powerful than it's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.640 
just a lot more powerful than it's
essentially<00:04:43.630> if<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.870> want<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.140> build<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.500> really

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
essentially if I want to build a really

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.090 
essentially if I want to build a really
great<00:04:44.980> gaming<00:04:45.790> rig<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.240> take<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:46.540> lands<00:04:47.100> idea

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
great gaming rig to take the lands idea

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.470 
great gaming rig to take the lands idea
this<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.580> more<00:04:48.790> if<00:04:48.850> you're<00:04:48.940> on<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> little<00:04:49.300> more

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
this is more if you're on a little more

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.360 
this is more if you're on a little more
of<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.720> value<00:04:50.200> oriented<00:04:50.680> system<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.280> that'd

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
of a value oriented system that that'd

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.770 
of a value oriented system that that'd
be<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> great<00:04:51.700> fit<00:04:51.910> ok<00:04:52.330> awesome
