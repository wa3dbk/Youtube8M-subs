along on the left side of it here until

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.370 
along on the left side of it here until
you<00:01:20.090> reach<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.330> checkpoint<00:01:20.510> sometimes<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
you reach the checkpoint sometimes you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
you reach the checkpoint sometimes you
don't<00:01:21.500> get<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.740> checkpoint<00:01:22.160> you've<00:01:22.250> got<00:01:22.340> to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
don't get the checkpoint you've got to

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.920 
don't get the checkpoint you've got to
jump<00:01:22.550> down<00:01:22.730> into<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.030> little<00:01:23.690> gap<00:01:23.900> between

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
jump down into the little gap between

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.780 
jump down into the little gap between
the<00:01:24.260> bridge<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.800> building<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.160> sort<00:01:25.700> of

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
the bridge and the building and sort of

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.580 
the bridge and the building and sort of
walk<00:01:25.940> around<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> different<00:01:26.510> way<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:27.230> if<00:01:27.560> you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
walk around a different way but if you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.050 
walk around a different way but if you
don't<00:01:27.770> get<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.920> checkpoint<00:01:28.310> just<00:01:28.820> kind<00:01:29.030> of

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
don't get the checkpoint just kind of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.390 
don't get the checkpoint just kind of
turn<00:01:29.270> around<00:01:29.710> go<00:01:30.710> back<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.070> you'll<00:01:31.160> be<00:01:31.190> right

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
turn around go back and you'll be right

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.700 
turn around go back and you'll be right
like<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.930> yeah<00:01:33.260> continue<00:01:33.620> to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
like that and then just yeah continue to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.250 
like that and then just yeah continue to
walk<00:01:33.830> along<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.340> building<00:01:34.910> here<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:35.360> you

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
walk along the building here and you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.570 
walk along the building here and you
shouldn't<00:01:36.530> have<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.890> worry<00:01:37.040> about<00:01:37.130> enemies<00:01:37.460> or

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
shouldn't have to worry about enemies or

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.790 
shouldn't have to worry about enemies or
anything<00:01:37.760> -<00:01:38.210> too<00:01:39.020> early<00:01:39.050> here<00:01:39.440> because<00:01:39.680> they

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
anything - too early here because they

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.860 
anything - too early here because they
won't<00:01:39.980> they<00:01:40.370> won't<00:01:40.430> spawn<00:01:40.880> or<00:01:41.540> anything<00:01:41.750> when

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
won't they won't spawn or anything when

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.060 
won't they won't spawn or anything when
I<00:01:41.900> open<00:01:42.140> if<00:01:42.230> they<00:01:42.290> do<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.530> can't<00:01:42.740> shoot<00:01:42.920> you

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
I open if they do they can't shoot you

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.040 
I open if they do they can't shoot you
and<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.760> make<00:01:43.940> one<00:01:43.970> under<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.330> building<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
and I make one under this building and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.320 
and I make one under this building and
you<00:01:45.800> should<00:01:45.980> get<00:01:46.130> your<00:01:46.280> next<00:01:46.670> checkpoint

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
you should get your next checkpoint

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.640 
you should get your next checkpoint
alright<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.900> then<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.020> want<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.260> jump<00:01:48.440> down

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
alright and then you want to jump down

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.290 
alright and then you want to jump down

enough<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.899> checkpoint<00:02:09.440> if<00:02:09.710> you're

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
enough you get that checkpoint if you're

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.980 
enough you get that checkpoint if you're
even<00:02:10.190> luckier<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.000> skull<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.360> there<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.780> pick

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
even luckier the skull is there you pick

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.970 
even luckier the skull is there you pick
it<00:02:12.110> up<00:02:12.260> and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
it up and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.619 
it up and

and just like that you got your

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.300 
and just like that you got your
achievement<00:02:15.110> five<00:02:15.560> gamers<00:02:15.890> go<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.159> head

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
achievement five gamers go in the head

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.710 
achievement five gamers go in the head
absolutely<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:16.819> worth<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.209> at<00:02:17.390> all<00:02:17.480> unless

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
absolutely not worth it at all unless

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.110 
absolutely not worth it at all unless
you<00:02:18.010> let<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.129> after<00:02:19.310> all<00:02:19.489> scholarship<00:02:19.909> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
you let your after all scholarship and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.160 
you let your after all scholarship and
once<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.299> pick<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.540> up<00:02:20.659> it<00:02:20.780> takes<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.049> that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
once you pick it up it takes you that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.240 
once you pick it up it takes you that
little<00:02:21.290> area<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:21.890> took<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.159> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
little area that it took you in the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.460 
little area that it took you in the
original<00:02:22.519> Halo<00:02:22.640> -<00:02:22.879> we<00:02:23.480> fight<00:02:23.780> impossibly

invincible<00:02:25.129> or<00:02:25.280> Leafs<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.970> guess<00:02:26.150> just

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
invincible or Leafs and I guess just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.240 
invincible or Leafs and I guess just
hope<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.540> survive<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.530> yeah<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:27.890> been<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.220> UH

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
hope to survive but yeah it's been a UH

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.949 
hope to survive but yeah it's been a UH
I<00:02:28.760> guess<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.060> uh<00:02:29.120> achievements<00:02:29.569> such<00:02:29.720> a
