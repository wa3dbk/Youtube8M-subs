00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.230 

so<00:00:05.299> you<00:00:05.390> have<00:00:05.540> this<00:00:05.720> kind<00:00:06.080> of<00:00:07.240> momentum

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
so you have this kind of momentum

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.350 
so you have this kind of momentum
approach<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.680> what<00:00:10.639> most<00:00:10.849> people<00:00:11.119> end<00:00:11.269> up

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
approach and what most people end up

00:00:11.360 --> 00:01:08.170 
approach and what most people end up
doing<00:00:24.580> really<00:00:25.580> great<00:00:25.820> positioning<00:01:07.180> but

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
doing really great positioning but

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:31.260 
doing really great positioning but
there's<00:01:08.360> another<00:01:08.570> way<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.740> other<00:01:09.860> way

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.609 

I'm<00:01:31.810> doing<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.540> kind<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.840> pure<00:01:35.110> with

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
I'm doing is it kind of pure with

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.550 
I'm doing is it kind of pure with
Shannon<00:01:35.920> pure<00:01:36.100> eternal<00:01:36.460> here<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:37.560> mixed

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
Shannon pure eternal here a mixed

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.260 
Shannon pure eternal here a mixed
internal<00:01:38.920> systems<00:01:39.369> oakwood<00:01:39.580> say<00:01:39.970> oh<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.119> don't

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
internal systems oakwood say oh I don't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.179 
internal systems oakwood say oh I don't
have<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.570> structure<00:01:40.810> here<00:01:41.110> he<00:01:41.259> has<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:42.040> I'm

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
have the structure here he has it so I'm

00:01:42.189 --> 00:02:33.890 
have the structure here he has it so I'm
gonna

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.290 

is<00:02:34.200> basic

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
is basic

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.259 
is basic
so<00:02:37.300> Crowley<00:02:37.720> if<00:02:38.050> your<00:02:38.230> internal<00:02:38.590> motion<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
so Crowley if your internal motion the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.830 
so Crowley if your internal motion the
shrink<00:02:40.569> expand<00:02:41.019> come<00:02:41.409> back

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.110 

it's<00:02:45.840> essential<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.099> led<00:02:48.090> by

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's essential that this is not led by

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's essential that this is not led by
the<00:02:48.390> breath<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:50.550> coordinated<00:02:51.420> because<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.560> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the breath in coordinated because if it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.250 
the breath in coordinated because if it
is<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.950> create<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> resistant<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
is you create a resistant kind of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.160 
is you create a resistant kind of
strength<00:02:59.540> I<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.950> got<00:03:02.069> structure<00:03:02.720> yes<00:03:03.720> clear

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
strength I just got structure yes clear

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:54.820 
strength I just got structure yes clear
specially<00:03:04.650> advantage

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.780 

it<00:03:55.830> also<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.280> ability<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.240> absorb
