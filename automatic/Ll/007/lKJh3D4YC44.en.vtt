going to change this one to the first
port<00:01:43.360> all<00:01:44.360> right<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.119> got<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:50.000> control

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
port all right so we got this control

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.830 
port all right so we got this control
this<00:01:50.860> number<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.340> hooked<00:01:53.270> up<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.479> my

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
this number one is hooked up to my

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.089 
this number one is hooked up to my
battery<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:54.619> bad<00:01:55.280> battery<00:01:55.759> controller<00:01:56.890> okay

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
this one the fourth one is on a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.069 
this one the fourth one is on a
controller<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:04.909> does<00:02:05.239> not<00:02:05.390> exist

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
controller that does not exist

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.410 
controller that does not exist
there's<00:02:06.349> no<00:02:06.619> controller<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:07.640> just<00:02:07.939> took<00:02:08.239> over

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
there's no controller it just took over

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
there's no controller it just took over
its<00:02:08.780> own<00:02:08.929> quadrant<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.829> whatever<00:02:10.099> reason<00:02:11.079> and

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
its own quadrant for whatever reason and

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.220 
its own quadrant for whatever reason and
this<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.670> my<00:02:13.819> second<00:02:14.269> controller<00:02:14.630> which<00:02:14.959> is

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
this is my second controller which is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.740 
this is my second controller which is
reading<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.280> headset<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.180> there<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.540> no

all right
so<00:02:23.959> here's<00:02:24.200> my<00:02:24.440> explanation<00:02:26.680> see<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.860> see

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
so here's my explanation see this see

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.370 
so here's my explanation see this see
this<00:02:28.370> headset<00:02:28.910> right<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.209> I'm<00:02:29.569> gonna<00:02:30.049> get<00:02:30.230> in

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
this headset right here I'm gonna get in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.979 
this headset right here I'm gonna get in
frame<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:31.489> will<00:02:31.700> not<00:02:31.910> connect<00:02:32.329> to<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.720> first

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
frame it will not connect to the first

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.080 
frame it will not connect to the first
quad<00:02:33.290> refer<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.859> second<00:02:34.220> quadrant<00:02:34.400> at<00:02:34.819> all

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
quad refer to the second quadrant at all

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.360 
quad refer to the second quadrant at all
it'll<00:02:35.959> skip<00:02:36.230> over<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.739> third<00:02:37.069> quadrant

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it'll skip over to the third quadrant

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.050 
it'll skip over to the third quadrant
right<00:02:37.760> here<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.889> it<00:02:39.889> will<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.489> keep<00:02:41.000> going

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
right here and it will just keep going

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.690 
right here and it will just keep going
