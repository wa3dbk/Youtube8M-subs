00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.870 
there's a lot so if one doesn't work you
can<00:03:37.230> try<00:03:37.260> other<00:03:37.500> ones<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.950> well<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> just

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
can try other ones as well so you just

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.430 
can try other ones as well so you just
want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.120> copy<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.450> shader<00:03:39.660> packs<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.019> folder

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
want to copy the shader packs a folder

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
want to copy the shader packs a folder
so<00:03:40.739> stress<00:03:41.160> command<00:03:41.459> C<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:42.810> drag

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
so stress command C or you can just drag

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.840 
so stress command C or you can just drag
it<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.170> drag<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.859> into<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.310> minecraft<00:03:44.700> folder

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
it and drag it into the minecraft folder

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.370 
it and drag it into the minecraft folder
directory<00:03:45.420> make<00:03:45.660> sure<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:46.200> any

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
directory make sure it's not in any

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.970 
directory make sure it's not in any
folder<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.579> click<00:03:47.810> paste<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:49.380> paste<00:03:49.650> item

folder so then click paste or paste item
you<00:03:50.609> will<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.880> now<00:03:51.150> shader<00:03:51.600> packs<00:03:51.840> with<00:03:52.350> all

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you will have now shader packs with all

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.620 
you will have now shader packs with all
the<00:03:52.890> shader<00:03:53.130> packs<00:03:53.340> installed<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:54.000> that's<00:03:54.510> all

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
the shader packs installed so that's all

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.759 
the shader packs installed so that's all
you<00:03:54.720> got<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:54.989> now<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.500> got<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.709> open

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
you got to do now you just got to open

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.060 
you got to do now you just got to open
up<00:03:55.950> minecraft<00:03:56.370> once<00:03:56.850> more<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.680> I'm<00:03:58.829> going<00:03:59.040> a

just<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.269> know<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:18.690> excited<00:04:19.049> for<00:04:19.079> this<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.680> have

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
just you know so excited for this I have

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.820 
just you know so excited for this I have
traded<00:04:20.430> this<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.970> will<00:04:21.150> work<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:22.080> will<00:04:22.140> work

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
traded this so it will work it will work

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.150 
traded this so it will work it will work
so<00:04:23.630> give<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.659> a<00:04:24.750> moment

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
so give it a moment

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.210 
so give it a moment
and<00:04:26.960> all<00:04:27.960> right<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.290> now<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.530> says<00:04:28.560> four<00:04:28.950> miles

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
and all right so now it says four miles

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.310 
and all right so now it says four miles
loaded<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:29.880> four<00:04:30.390> miles<00:04:30.570> active<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.170> that

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
loaded and four miles active so that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.050 
loaded and four miles active so that
means<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.680> good<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.280> then<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.760> want<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:32.940> go

means it's good so then you want to go

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.570 
means it's good so then you want to go
into<00:04:33.300> options<00:04:33.860> shaders<00:04:34.860> as<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.310> can<00:04:35.430> see

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
into options shaders as you can see

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.220 
into options shaders as you can see
there's<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.910> new<00:04:36.150> shaders<00:04:36.510> button<00:04:36.810> click<00:04:37.080> on

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
there's a new shaders button click on

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.930 
there's a new shaders button click on
that<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:38.100> will<00:04:38.130> notice<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.610> there<00:04:38.820> isn't

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
detect it so seeing shader packs but

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.080 
detect it so seeing shader packs but
it's<00:05:23.850> better<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.420> do<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.600> um<00:05:25.940> let's<00:05:26.940> see

this so this that open this up and copy
this<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.100> command<00:05:35.400> C<00:05:35.670> and<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:38.160> want<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.400> go<00:05:38.490> in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
this so command C and you want to go in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.130 
this so command C and you want to go in

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
well if it doesn't work and go to with

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.249 
well if it doesn't work and go to with
the<00:06:53.699> light<00:06:53.970> shader<00:06:54.360> packs<00:06:54.630> and<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.110> will

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
the light shader packs and that will

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.320 
the light shader packs and that will
work<00:06:55.410> as<00:06:55.620> well<00:06:55.800> so<00:06:56.490> don't<00:06:56.759> forget<00:06:56.910> to<00:06:57.090> leave<00:06:57.270> a
