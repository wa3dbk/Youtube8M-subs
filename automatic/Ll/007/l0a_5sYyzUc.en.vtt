 will be something like I have here in the 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.920
 image 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.840
 the code 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.840

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.840
 this 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.449
 or we can also do it through 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.729
 our phone dialing this number 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.930

 device that has good android 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.530

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.650
 here we can choose the language 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.119
 [Music] 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.000
 here we will see where we want to save 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 our 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.230

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.320
 we can make look what is the 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.950
 Program

 the application file 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.879
 then I do not know 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.520
 what application are we going to download the 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.540
 application that we do by google 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.579
 this is called 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.579
 [Music] 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.840
 we search 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:43.990
 what is the application that we 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.870

 the application give you download and apply 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.960
 ap-7 and we're going to name it in this 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.700
 If I keep well and here is 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.260

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.040
 [Music] 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.100
 Once this is done we could go to 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.520
 which is where we are keeping what is 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.190

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.940
 what is my application 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.810
 not making more friends we can search 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.810
 the other applications like 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.150
 I dont know 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.100

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.600
 and as you can see here they have the prices 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:45.169
 these pressure can be downloaded 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.169
 because we miss an error and good 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.320
