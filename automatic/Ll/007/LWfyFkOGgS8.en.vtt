this nearly 12,000 acre monument was set

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230 
this nearly 12,000 acre monument was set
aside<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> 1924<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.580> President<00:00:30.119> Calvin

rocks and pinnacles they have a very

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.030 
rocks and pinnacles they have a very
violent<00:00:35.550> volcanic<00:00:36.450> history<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
violent volcanic history with the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.119 
violent volcanic history with the
eruption<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> Turkey<00:00:39.540> Creek<00:00:39.719> volcano<00:00:40.200> 27

eruption of the Turkey Creek volcano 27

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
eruption of the Turkey Creek volcano 27
million<00:00:41.340> years<00:00:41.640> ago<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.750> volcano<00:00:43.170> was

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
million years ago the volcano was

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
million years ago the volcano was
erupting<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.250> gigantic<00:00:44.789> ash<00:00:45.059> eruption<00:00:45.780> very

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
erupting in a gigantic ash eruption very

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
erupting in a gigantic ash eruption very
much<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.890> Mount<00:00:47.129> st.<00:00:47.399> Helens<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.910> Washington

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
much like Mount st. Helens in Washington

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
much like Mount st. Helens in Washington
back<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.050> 1980<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.670> whole<00:00:50.879> region<00:00:51.090> was

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
back in 1980 so this whole region was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
back in 1980 so this whole region was
covered<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.780> layers<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.379> ash<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:53.489> at

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
covered with layers of ash here at

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
covered with layers of ash here at
closest<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> volcano<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.410> layers<00:00:55.649> were

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
closest to the volcano the layers were

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.760 
closest to the volcano the layers were
almost<00:00:56.190> 2,000<00:00:56.850> feet<00:00:57.000> deep<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
almost 2,000 feet deep that was the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
almost 2,000 feet deep that was the
first<00:00:58.980> part<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> volcanic<00:00:59.670> activity<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
first part of the volcanic activity the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
first part of the volcanic activity the
second<00:01:01.289> chapter<00:01:01.530> were<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.070> newing<00:01:02.430> are

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
second chapter were then newing are

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
second chapter were then newing are
Dante's<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.390> pyroclastic<00:01:04.019> flows<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:05.280> are

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
Dante's or pyroclastic flows these are

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
Dante's or pyroclastic flows these are
huge<00:01:05.700> clouds<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.210> ash<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.840> gas<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.380> came

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
huge clouds of ash and gas that came

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
huge clouds of ash and gas that came
billowing<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> sides<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.030> volcano

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
billowing down the sides of volcano

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
billowing down the sides of volcano
they're<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.530> hot<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.430> fast

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
they're very hot and they're very fast

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
they're very hot and they're very fast
so<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.689> anything<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.229> left<00:01:13.260> standing<00:01:13.770> after

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so if anything was left standing after

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
so if anything was left standing after
the<00:01:14.100> direct<00:01:14.460> ash<00:01:14.640> fall<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.780> wiped<00:01:16.020> out

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the direct ash fall out it was wiped out

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.340 
the direct ash fall out it was wiped out
by<00:01:16.500> these<00:01:16.619> new<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.400> Dante's<00:01:18.140> finally<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
by these new me or Dante's finally so

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.630 
by these new me or Dante's finally so
much<00:01:19.409> material<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:20.100> blown<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
much material was blown out of the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
much material was blown out of the
volcano<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.799> top<00:01:22.799> collapsed<00:01:23.610> forming

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
volcano that the top collapsed forming

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.600 
volcano that the top collapsed forming
the<00:01:24.180> gigantic<00:01:24.720> caldera<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.439> estimated<00:01:26.369> 12

miles across and five thousand feet deep

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
miles across and five thousand feet deep
as<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.299> ash<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:31.110> Rock<00:01:31.470> debris

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
as that ash and other Rock debris

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
as that ash and other Rock debris
settled<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> material<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:32.970> still<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.479> hot

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
settled the material was still so hot

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020 
settled the material was still so hot
that<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.650> melted<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.340> welded<00:01:35.909> together

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that it melted or welded together

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
that it melted or welded together
creating<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> wonderful<00:01:37.350> rock<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.799> known

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

as rhyolite as the rhyolite was cooling

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.010 
as rhyolite as the rhyolite was cooling
it<00:01:40.680> started<00:01:41.009> cracking<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.670> jointing<00:01:42.360> there

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it started cracking and jointing there

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289
