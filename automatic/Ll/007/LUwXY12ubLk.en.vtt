a<00:01:35.509> half<00:01:35.539> by<00:01:35.810> fourteen<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.819> from<00:01:38.240> last

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450

a half by fourteen that is from last
year<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.079> then<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:39.950> also<00:01:40.159> have<00:01:40.579> a<00:01:40.880> five<00:01:41.539> by

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
year and then I also have a five by

year and then I also have a five by
fourteen<00:01:42.319> from<00:01:42.619> 1966<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.149> they're<00:01:44.779> tuned

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
fourteen from 1966 so they're tuned

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.739 
fourteen from 1966 so they're tuned
relatively<00:01:45.889> similar<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:47.359> I<00:01:47.569> don't

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
relatively similar that I don't

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:48.969 
relatively similar that I don't
necessarily<00:01:47.959> think<00:01:48.259> they<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.649> sound<00:01:48.859> the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
necessarily think they have to sound the

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.469 
necessarily think they have to sound the
exact<00:01:49.279> same<00:01:49.520> but<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:49.969> want<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.179> give<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:50.450> a

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
exact same but I just want to give you a

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.499 
exact same but I just want to give you a
little<00:01:50.659> taste<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:51.259> that

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
little taste of that

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.929 
little taste of that
and<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:54.049> think<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.349> pretty<00:01:54.560> great<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.130> give<00:01:55.909> it

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and I think it's pretty great so give it
