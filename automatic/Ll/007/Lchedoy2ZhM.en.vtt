00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.210 
special to me it was a personal issue
it's<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.680> those<00:01:39.740> things<00:01:39.950> where<00:01:40.100> you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
it's one of those things where you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.560 
it's one of those things where you
really<00:01:40.400> looking<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.759> take<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.030> big<00:01:41.270> jump

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
really looking to take that big jump

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.060 
really looking to take that big jump
there's<00:01:41.960> really<00:01:42.170> no<00:01:42.410> other<00:01:42.560> way<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.800> do<00:01:43.040> it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
there's really no other way to do it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
there's really no other way to do it
other<00:01:43.340> than<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.640> MBA<00:01:43.850> program

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
