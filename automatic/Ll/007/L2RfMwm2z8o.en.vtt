 Toyota Group's Toyota Marketing Japan

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.569
 Appeared in "Evangelion New Movie Version" 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.279
 As a official car for the "Special Administrative Agency NERV" 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.049
 In commemoration of the Toyota Prius PHV being certified 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.670
 In cooperation with Evangelion and Hakone 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.030
 Former Sengokuhara Junior High School in Hakone 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.389
 The main character, Shinji 

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:27.490
 Appointed as the 3rd New Tokyo City No. 2 Junior High School 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.479
 "Power supplement plan power saving promotion version" 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.560
 has been held 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.820
 We as a car relationship company 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 Much interest in cars now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 There is a case I can not bring 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.600
 Because there are many things 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 As much as possible 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.580
 I want you to bring it to you 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.670
 In the wake of fans of Evangelion 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.625
 In the same way, if you have an interest 

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.040
 I think one thing 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.200
 The other is Prius plug-in hybrid 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.830
 Though there is talk 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.380
 The case is difficult to explain in the middle and you can not understand it 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.189
 Because there are a lot of things while using such animation techniques 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.049
 I'm thinking of getting everyone to understand the product 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.450
 It is that we planned this event 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.799
 The Toyota Prius PHV (plug-in hybrid) is 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.360
 From the household power supply scheduled to be released in 2012 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 It is a hybrid car that can be charged directly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.929
 Commuting and shopping as a short distance electric car 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.999
 Long distance can be run as a conventional hybrid car 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.260
 The remaining amount of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.519
 You can ride without worrying 

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:38.000
 It is a next-generation eco-car promoted by Toyota Motor Corporation 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.179
 This Prius Plug-in Hybrid 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.269
 Various functions with this Evangelion 

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:47.609
 By collaborating in Evangelion 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.900
 By commentary of person named Ibaraki Misato 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.200
 Because I made the original movie intelligibly 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.109
 At first we think that we want you to see it by all means 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.000
 This time about saving electricity by promoting version 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.139
 In terms of not using electricity as much as possible 

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.979
 In fact, our hybrids generate electricity 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.220
 Because some cars have a function to supply electricity 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.389
 In fact, this time Estima's hybrid 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.550
 Line up in a row with electricity from there 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.679
 The power of the light of this exhibition or the power of the projector 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:21.869
 It is because it is ready 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.200
 "There is such a function in the hybrid!" 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.559
 To let you know that 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:30.029
 I am making a mechanism 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.459
 Besides this, at the venue Evangelion's 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.660
 Exhibitions of classrooms that reflect the scene 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780
 Life-size Evangelion's first machine 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.199
 We also carry out AR exhibitions etc. 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.950
 To present a driving map 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.000
 Let me do it, there is an augmented reality called AR 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.750
 Also in the screen this pops up 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.849
 I can see various commentary 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.300
 Just looking at the drive map of Hakone 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.509
 If you can drive Hakone again 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.850
 It also means 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.329
 First of all I hope you enjoy it .. 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.720
 After that you can be delighted by various fans 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
 Reproduce the classroom or various materials 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.629
 Because we are exhibiting 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.989
 I want to see it by all means 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.009
 On this occasion, even a little chop 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.340
 I would like to be interested .. and Prius 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.450
 Plug-in hybrid is 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.069
 I want you to understand a little about what it is 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.680
 That's the true part of the aim 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.029
 "Prius PHV, the future of mankind and the earth 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.720
 The connected grand project will start now " 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.990
 "National complementary plan" 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.709
 "Start up"
