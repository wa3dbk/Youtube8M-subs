00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.689
 a second guys I have to tell you something 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.520
 important 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.990
 now I have a website where I can 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.519
 put all downloads and tv the channel 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.690
 of French lake for last information 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.690
 I recommend you look at the description 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.869
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.259
 this new video by francis drake eo 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.539
 January 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.610
 but see an intelligent furnace 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.500
 exact guys an intelligent furnace 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 but what does it mean intelligent well it 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.029
 you will discover only in a few seconds 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 when I go to analyze it I tell you 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.599
 only that this furnace is born from 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.690
 my point of view very much 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.550
 innovative of course someone 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.379
 else maybe a similar one will have already done it 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.820
 but we really don't care so 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.210
 let's see this right away 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.129
 review beautiful girl we go now 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 to try in our furnace then 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.609
 we take our objects we want 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 bake let's invent the crate e 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.449
 let's activate the lever at this point 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.390
 you will notice that trolleys will be activated 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.729
 and those carts have the function of 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.370
 carry all the materials inside 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.199
 of the furnaces then to sort them in 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.790
 these furnace to give to every furnace 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 some material to cook so from 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570
 cook everything much faster 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.820
 in this way the furnaces once 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.500
 cooked all the material will send the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.630
 result in those or why 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.540
 see right under the furnaces themselves 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.150
 and these hoppers will make the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.280
 our product will end up in the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.050
 home where exactly we will go then to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.850
 collect items and that's where 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.710
 we find the peculiarity of this 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.990
 structure or the ability to take 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.390
 of charcoal from the cooked objects e 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.320
 to bring it directly into the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 furnaces 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.890
 through these filters that are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 inside the trolley and inside the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.090
 in this way the furnaces hoppers 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 they will always be pnd charcoal 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840
 so guys this is the truth 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.820
 particularity having this system of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.580
 automatic charcoal mission that goes 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.960
 to put herself inside the furnaces 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.520
 furnaces will practically always be 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.110
 ready to support any type of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.730
 object for which guys the only one 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.280
 trick is to put every 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.160
 a lot of wood inside the system 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 raw and in such a way as to be able to enter 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.900
 precisely the charcoal inside the furnaces 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 so guys every now and then put some 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.830
 of raw wood inside the system so 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 to be able to create 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.510
 it is not so you can put it in 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 the whole cycle instead to turn off the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.900
 system you have to pull your own lever 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.480
 when the two carts will be visible 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100
 through those two pieces of glass 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.320
 unfortunately this is a problem 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.040
 technician or notice other ways to do it 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.810
 so guys 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 at this point we just have to go to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.150
 see how to build the structure well 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.100
 guys to build this structure 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.540
 first of all we need the speakers 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.930
 that you will put right in the position 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.020
 that you see now in the video now below 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.590
 at the cash desks he likes to put the first or for 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 those works are practically those 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.300
 which then lead through the cart 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.190
 the objects that must be cooked 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.840
 inside the furnaces so let's put them o 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.660
 for in this position 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.030
 add on top of the powered rails 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 or those red ones that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.900
 they light up with the red stone and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.810
 then under the mind's mind we put the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.540
 our beloved furnaces that must 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.760
 just cook the material now let's go 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.590
 to put behind these other furnaces 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.940
 or for that they practically have the role of 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.459
 enter the charcoal then we will see a 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.260
 how this thing will work anyway 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.190
 above these or because now we have 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.570
 put here let's put some rails here too 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.280
 fed and at this point we do not stay 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.790
 that close the extremes with a little 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.989
 block well guys after putting a 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.840
 little blocks to close the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.420
 extremes where there are rails we put 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 above these rails two mine karts with 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.090
 obviously the above lauper we put a 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 other or for on the side of the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.890
 cash and we put this under for three 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.530
 exactly three rich cast look 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.120
 upward now these thrown ri 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.720
 thanks to this red stone system that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.680
 now I am seeing illustrating serve for 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.840
 send over to the chest upstairs 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.060
 pretty much everything that has been cooked 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.670
 so if you put some iron in this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.030
 case after the iron has been baked vi 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.280
 will send over the pieces as they say 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.140
 iron the ingots to make them even me 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.970
 iron barrels came to mind 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.180
 at this point let's go inside 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.820
 alle ai 64 furnaces of charcoal 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.289
 this must be done to every furnace 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.090
 after having once put all 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.850
 these 64 take all the furnaces 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.669
 let's go to filter ai or per 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.700
 then the filter what is is a way to 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.220
 let pass what we want inside 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.660
 to a particular object in this case 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.660
 lauper so let's put 64 64 64 64 of 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.310
 ground and then 64 of charcoal we make the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.440
 same thing with all the other works e 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.060
 obviously also with the trolley that stands 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.590
 above these hoppers then in this 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.930
 so we will do so that I know the charcoal 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.419
 can be fuel of ours 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.940
 furnaces now we put some or for 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.160
 under the furnaces that I look at all 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.650
 to the left and ending up in the 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.599
 lower player and then we go to 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.580
 close down the structure we have 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.320
 created so far 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.150
 now we have to make the final touches 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.640
 practically because we have to go to 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.070
 make the system to be able to activate the 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 we only need trolleys to do this 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.410
 a lever a bit of red stone and gods 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.680
 red stone repeaters therefore 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.780
 let's put the lever on our right then 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.560
 let's get behind this lever 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.560
 some blocks on which to lay the 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.440
 redstone and other blocks on which then 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.479
 support the repeaters and it is precisely 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.400
 still other rexton then boys 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.780
 this is the only way to close everything 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.310
 the system and to open it 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.500
 unfortunately I have not found other ways 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.180
 so I will show it to you then 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.820
 you can modify it as you wish 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.590
 now look at activating the lever precisely 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.000
 all the system will work well guys 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.100
 so now let's see if the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.720
 our furnace and it works I put in 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.760
 cook eight pieces of iron and 4 of wood 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.120
 raw rough wood obviously you have to 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.680
 always put it on because it is for 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.330
 put the charcoal back into the cycle 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.760
 then precisely from the raw kingdom will come out 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.910
 so look like now 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.640
 practically we are already at 8 pieces of 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.350
 cooked iron then we close the system 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.590
 when the two carriages are parallel e 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.990
 they see themselves through the glass and wants 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.250
 well guys the video ends here or there 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.110
 see you next time and me 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.880
 I recommend you decorate your structure 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.760
 because otherwise in the state of before 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.330
 it really sucks to say the least 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.200
 bad language 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.669
 so I advise you to decorate it in 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.910
 this case the decoration made me 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.250
 dirty his link to his channel 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.720
 is in description and nothing said this 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.700
 I wish you a good day 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.250
 put a like commentate write me 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.540
 anything and share the video 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.520
 subscribe to the channel if you do not have them 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.450
 already done and we'll see you next 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.110
 time 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.110
 hello everyone guys
