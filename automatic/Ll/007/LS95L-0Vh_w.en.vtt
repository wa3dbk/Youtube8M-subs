00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
for with this um this not just a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.720 
for with this um this not just a
specific<00:00:31.140> episode<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.070> arc<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> whole

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
specific episode but this arc as a whole

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.610 
specific episode but this arc as a whole
which<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.300> why<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> didn't<00:00:33.870> review<00:00:34.110> list<00:00:34.290> last

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
which is why I didn't review list last

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.639 
which is why I didn't review list last
episode<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.579> was<00:00:35.880> gonna<00:00:36.059> wait<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
know as a complete package since we're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.330

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
a jounin because he gets dismissed as an

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
a jounin because he gets dismissed as an
Ambu<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> end<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> episode<00:00:50.789> which<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.030> which

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
was 11 I was looking for consistency I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.619 
was 11 I was looking for consistency I
wanted<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.640> sure<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.390> uh

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
wanted to make sure that it actually uh

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
wanted to make sure that it actually uh
you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.680> line<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you know when you when you line it up it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
you know when you when you line it up it
actually<00:01:02.699> makes<00:01:03.120> sense<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.040> there<00:01:05.040> were

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually makes sense and there were

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.560 
actually makes sense and there were
efforts<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:06.150> towards

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
efforts that they put towards

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
efforts that they put towards
consistency<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:08.100> repeating<00:01:08.520> Itachi's<00:01:08.970> age<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
consistency one repeating Itachi's age a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.899 
consistency one repeating Itachi's age a
lot<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.689> Lucky's<00:01:10.049> 13<00:01:10.409> 13<00:01:10.799> 13<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.640> big

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
lot you know Lucky's 13 13 13 so big

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
lot you know Lucky's 13 13 13 so big
more<00:01:12.119> sense<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.140> his<00:01:13.290> head<00:01:13.530> he

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
more sense that you know in his head he

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.870 
more sense that you know in his head he
would<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.220> thought<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
would have thought that this was the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
would have thought that this was the
right<00:01:15.000> thing<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:16.110> he's<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> age

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
right thing to do because he's the age

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
right thing to do because he's the age
that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:18.060> meet<00:01:18.330> troska<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.380> know

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that you know we meet troska at you know

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.940 
that you know we meet troska at you know
when<00:01:19.740> uh<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:20.369> /<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.450> starts<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
when uh when / one starts so you can

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
when uh when / one starts so you can
assume<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:24.150> once<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.780> skeez<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> age

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
assume that maybe once a skeez that age

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
assume that maybe once a skeez that age
he<00:01:25.380> might<00:01:25.530> make<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> stupid<00:01:26.040> decision<00:01:26.070> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
he might make a stupid decision like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
he might make a stupid decision like
that<00:01:26.790> maybe<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.360> he's<00:01:27.479> strong<00:01:27.750> enough<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.170> kill

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that maybe if he's strong enough to kill

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
that maybe if he's strong enough to kill
all<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:28.650> people<00:01:28.710> maybe<00:01:29.299> probably<00:01:30.299> still

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
all these people maybe probably still

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
all these people maybe probably still
not<00:01:30.720> maybe<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.470> another<00:01:31.619> movement<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.430> saw<00:01:32.579> them

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
not maybe in another movement I saw them

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.350 
not maybe in another movement I saw them
making<00:01:32.820> towards<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.479> consistency<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.360> obito

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
making towards a consistency was a obito

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
making towards a consistency was a obito
that<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.990> very<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.829> important

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
that was very very very very important
