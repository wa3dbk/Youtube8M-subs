00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.970
 can you explain why you why 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.970
 by offering my RKC 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:15.080
 takes care of these questions no that's different 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.599
 well i am neither confident nor going 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.939
 win play at home have strong 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.400
 team but yes it certainly doesn't work 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.070
 become easy and rkc is a tricky one 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.590
 team and also it has a quality 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.179
 certainly in conversion so they are strong 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.310
 must be on our guard but if 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.440
 We just have good names 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.030
 concentrated and we are going to win it 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.710
 you are working on a winning series 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.839
 and that must give confidence and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.360
 trust in sport is always important 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.580
 Yes and you notice that with us 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.610
 team also saw az last Sunday 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.949
 yeah yeah the stars are like that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.460
 goal and yet not wrong that we can have 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.769
 you say yes go forcing but that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.900
 we did not we were patient and 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.269
 cost that fell in the yes that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.670
 cares about you marrying his trainer 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.229
 view from we play better than last 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.869
 season 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.460
 what do you think of that statement? 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.110
 For years I have been partly with it 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.160
 once we also play in a different way 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500
 of course 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.780
 last year it was more and the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.270
 switch that we are very strong at 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.890
 and now we play more in possession 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.080
 especially with the target man Perlas 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.690
 yes that we are now handling better and better 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.100
 and m respond him search and 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.960
 and then come below and from there 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.460
 Furthermore, playing football is also for one 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.409
 play in your central position in the back 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.580
 easier with summer peak such a deep 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.430
 play striker 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.960
 yes sometimes certainly when under pressure 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.260
 and you can not enter the ball and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.180
 just give them a long way forward I can 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.470
 it is such a good ball you do it 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 can hold arrows 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.880
 and can drag it under again so yes too 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.190
 for us that is nice but I think so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.659
 benefits timo i thought of the week 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.710
 in Alkmaar where it is incredibly hard 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.690
 You must have tightened wax too 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.920
 municipality that field at times the old 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.870
 Stefan the free to see again and again 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.979
 play expand well play for sure 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.900
 play 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.990
 do you think you're as good as again 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.810
 you were not quite yet 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 i am always somewhat critical but you are 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.140
 I agree with you again 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.379
 yes i want to be on my way back with one 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.629
 I could be on my old level again 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.180
 not there yet I think but yes I go there 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.540
 and therefore more wetzel I go 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 play 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 the closer I get there, I think 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.780
 see a-list there newspaper colleagues and we 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.610
 on radio and tv rijnmond let's be honest 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 then they speculate with them all over 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.120
 young players who may or may not be in the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.260
 interest of big clubs then 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.069
 the bellies of the week with you two 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 jokes 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.519
 chelsea and liverpool read that than 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 in the newspaper or or 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.060
 that how you do that through other no I have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.130
 heard nothing about it and you read that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.260
 also on the internet and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.430
 on one side you think where there is smoke 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.379
 fire but I know nothing and I am here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.480
 also not working on it now i focus on it 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.980
 feyenoord and that is important we are 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.569
 want a good performance this season 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.680
 drop and yes I am working on one now 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.290
 with a trance and because I am there now 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.819
 one ready for my god it's a brand 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.079
 that you say that man have other young ones 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.150
 professional ski are in shape 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.230
 often even earlier that age that 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.109
 to take a step 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.000
 but you don't intend no 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.380
 because for me 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.250
 the sporting aspect for me it 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.720
 most important is a yes what mine 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.569
 objective is so to speak 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280
 a maximum from myself language and 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.489
 yeah right now i think that's near 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.590
 feyenoord still yes i am honest 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.329
 that does of course go and me 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 A moment come when you're ready for that 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.950
 steps that you 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 and that you yes that you want to put that too 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.560
 but yes this people have not got that far 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.690
 yes you know news can go on and on 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 that is why it is just as it is for myself 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.329
 just now have a nice match 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.680
 and that's just it now 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.510
 most important but departure in the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.069
 winter break is not about killing what you rest 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.400
 is not negotiable 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.069
 no after winning on that seems not to be allowed 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.349
 no actually about yes but yes there 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.120
 I'm just honest about it and I do 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.549
 I am not in favor of it anyway 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.959
 to pull you in there so yes 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.800
 certainly yes we are again the season 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.680
 fairly good 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.420
 we also started that line two season 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.019
 by themselves and also the hulk 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.019
 like people
