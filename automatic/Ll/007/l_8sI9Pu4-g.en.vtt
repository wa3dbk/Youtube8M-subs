movement a little bit because while the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.010 
movement a little bit because while the
Cape<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.880> pliable<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.630> still<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> little

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
Cape is pliable it is still a little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.960 
Cape is pliable it is still a little
rigid<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.649> it's<00:01:52.220> gonna<00:01:52.369> prevent<00:01:52.759> him<00:01:52.939> from

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
rigid and it's gonna prevent him from

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.429 
rigid and it's gonna prevent him from
being<00:01:53.240> able<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.479> raise<00:01:53.630> his<00:01:53.810> arms<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:54.140> all<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
being able to raise his arms up all the

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.800 
being able to raise his arms up all the
way<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.820> how<00:01:56.000> Batman<00:01:56.420> usually

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
way but this is how Batman usually

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
way but this is how Batman usually
appears<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.409> The<00:01:57.560> Young<00:01:57.710> Justice<00:01:57.920> cartoon<00:01:58.520> so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
appears in The Young Justice cartoon so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.460 
appears in The Young Justice cartoon so
I<00:01:59.060> think<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.509> perfect<00:02:00.020> fit<00:02:00.049> for<00:02:00.229> this

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
I think it's a perfect fit for this

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.320 
I think it's a perfect fit for this
figure<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.920> really<00:02:01.429> like<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.850> over<00:02:02.210> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
figure and I really like that over the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.460 
figure and I really like that over the
shoulders<00:02:02.720> look<00:02:04.750> aside<00:02:05.750> from<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.110> he's<00:02:06.319> got

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
shoulders look aside from that he's got

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.979 
shoulders look aside from that he's got
a<00:02:06.500> nice<00:02:06.770> slimmed<00:02:07.640> kind<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.119> animated<00:02:08.600> look<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
a nice slimmed kind of animated look to

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.590 
a nice slimmed kind of animated look to
his<00:02:09.140> head<00:02:09.319> sculpt<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.030> paint<00:02:11.239> job<00:02:11.420> on<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.000 
his head sculpt and the paint job on the
figure<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:11.900> really<00:02:12.110> cool<00:02:12.410> because<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
figure is really cool because the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.520 
figure is really cool because the
lighter<00:02:13.700> gray<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.299> his<00:02:14.450> bodysuit<00:02:15.080> actually

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
has this metallic flake kind of look to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530 
has this metallic flake kind of look to
the<00:02:17.989> paint<00:02:18.260> which<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.890> really<00:02:19.400> neat<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.970> then

as articulation goes on the figure we

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.880 
as articulation goes on the figure we
get<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.959> same<00:02:33.140> centered<00:02:33.440> movement<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.799> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.259 
head it can turn all the way around 360
degrees<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.040> said<00:02:37.250> before<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.850> shoulder

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
bit of a wash or something because it's

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.670

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
corner and then the far left corner so

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.660 
corner and then the far left corner so
