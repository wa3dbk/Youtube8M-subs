00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
rank Balrog and you know this arcade

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.330 
rank Balrog and you know this arcade
edition<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.640> probably<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.769> either<00:02:47.769> top

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
edition it's probably like either top

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.810 
edition it's probably like either top
five<00:02:48.670> or<00:02:49.030> top<00:02:49.090> eight<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.370> ran<00:02:51.370> him<00:02:51.489> like<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
five or top eight I ran him like that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.690 
five or top eight I ran him like that
because<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.209> lot<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:53.190> Viper<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.459> still

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
because this lot like Viper is still

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.550 
because this lot like Viper is still
good<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.720> long<00:02:55.959> as<00:02:56.140> cheap<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:58.390> twins<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
good be long as cheap like twins the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.340 
good be long as cheap like twins the
twins<00:02:59.590> like<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.489> still<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.180> like<00:03:01.390> play

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
twins like we still have to like play

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.039 
twins like we still have to like play
them<00:03:02.530> more<00:03:02.769> but<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.100> think<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.549> I<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.810> John

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
them more but I think like I think John

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.800 
them more but I think like I think John
is<00:03:05.079> very<00:03:05.440> good<00:03:05.620> yang<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.549> strong<00:03:07.480> way

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
is very good yang is strong way

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.280 
is very good yang is strong way
and<00:03:10.069> give<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.219> really<00:03:11.459> good<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.849> know<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.989> I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and give is really good to know so I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.270 
and give is really good to know so I
mean<00:03:13.650> there<00:03:14.400> might<00:03:14.549> be<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.969> a<00:03:15.299> little<00:03:16.170> bit<00:03:17.129> of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
mean there might be like a little bit of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.849 
mean there might be like a little bit of
like<00:03:17.510> matchups<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.540> bar<00:03:19.109> on<00:03:19.140> might<00:03:19.439> have<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
like matchups that bar on might have a

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.309 
like matchups that bar on might have a
harder<00:03:20.310> time<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.760> still<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.359> think<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:22.019> top

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
harder time but still I think it's top

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.660 
harder time but still I think it's top
five<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:22.769> he<00:03:22.859> still<00:03:23.069> fights<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.489> top

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
five because he still fights the top

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.030 
five because he still fights the top
tiers<00:03:23.939> a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> other<00:03:25.409> play<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.799> saying

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
tiers a lot of the other play is saying

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
tiers a lot of the other play is saying
that<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.400> projectile<00:03:27.000> fighters<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.870> know

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
that the projectile fighters you know

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.399 
that the projectile fighters you know
they<00:03:28.379> feel<00:03:28.620> weaker<00:03:28.980> do<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.700> notice<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.120> or

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
they feel weaker do you notice it or

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.690 
they feel weaker do you notice it or
it's<00:03:31.409> not<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.709> they're<00:03:31.859> weaker<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.519> that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
it's not that they're weaker is is that

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.309 
it's not that they're weaker is is that
there's<00:03:32.879> so<00:03:33.090> many<00:03:33.269> ways<00:03:33.719> of<00:03:33.959> getting<00:03:34.230> around

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
there's so many ways of getting around
