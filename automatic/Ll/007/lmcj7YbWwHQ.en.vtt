we're<00:02:18.670> talking<00:02:18.760> about<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.150> 20<00:02:19.629> bucks<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
we're talking about like 20 bucks and

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.270 
we're talking about like 20 bucks and
said<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> couple<00:02:20.379> hundred<00:02:20.530> bucks<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:21.129> they'll

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
said a couple hundred bucks and they'll

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.250 
said a couple hundred bucks and they'll
survive<00:02:21.610> get<00:02:22.299> them<00:02:22.420> checked<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.930> everything

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
survive get them checked and everything

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.229 
survive get them checked and everything
well<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.830> question<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.879> whether<00:02:25.090> or<00:02:25.150> not

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
well the question is whether or not

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.149 
well the question is whether or not
it'll<00:02:25.450> survive<00:02:25.750> being<00:02:26.049> stolen<00:02:26.709> but<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.010> terms

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
it'll survive being stolen but in terms

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.300 
it'll survive being stolen but in terms
of<00:02:27.310> getting<00:02:27.459> like<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.299> don't<00:02:28.540> think<00:02:28.690> anything

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
of getting like I don't think anything

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.270 
of getting like I don't think anything
you<00:02:30.310> could<00:02:30.489> probably<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:31.739> can't<00:02:32.739> imagine<00:02:32.860> what

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
you could probably I can't imagine what

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.920 
you could probably I can't imagine what
you<00:02:33.400> could<00:02:33.489> do<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.060> do<00:02:34.390> damage<00:02:34.780> something

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930

inside<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.319> pelican<00:02:35.709> case<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.069> have<00:02:36.459> to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
inside of a pelican case you have to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.180 
inside of a pelican case you have to
drop<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> from<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.390> high<00:02:37.660> up<00:02:37.920> gravity<00:02:38.920> becomes

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
drop it from so high up gravity becomes

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.000 
drop it from so high up gravity becomes
a<00:02:39.340> massive<00:02:39.730> issue<00:02:39.879> or<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.079> sudden<00:02:41.379> stop<00:02:41.410> after
