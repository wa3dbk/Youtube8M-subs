benches<00:00:33.949> take<00:00:34.949> our<00:00:35.100> level<00:00:36.440> plum<00:00:37.440> these<00:00:37.620> up

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:56.639 

go<00:00:42.200> ahead<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.470> use<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:42.590> marker

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.930

transfer these marks to the top of the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.880 
transfer these marks to the top of the
log<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.760> we'll<00:01:01.879> go<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.180> other<00:01:02.329> side<00:01:02.890> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
log and we'll go to the other side and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
log and we'll go to the other side and
do<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.309> same<00:01:04.400> thing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.840 

and<00:01:08.200> we'll<00:01:08.530> plump<00:01:08.890> them<00:01:08.950> up<00:01:09.070> again<00:01:11.850> transfer

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and we'll plump them up again transfer

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.550 
and we'll plump them up again transfer
them<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.180> top<00:01:13.420> just<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:13.780> we<00:01:14.020> did<00:01:14.200> down<00:01:14.350> on

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
them to the top just like we did down on

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.630 
them to the top just like we did down on
that<00:01:14.740> end<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.950> next<00:01:18.130> thing<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.370> do<00:01:18.520> is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
that end so the next thing you do is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.090 
that end so the next thing you do is
just<00:01:18.670> transfer<00:01:19.300> these<00:01:19.540> lines<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.860> end<00:01:21.040> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
just transfer these lines from end to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.860 
just transfer these lines from end to
end<00:01:21.190> there's<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> couple<00:01:22.300> different<00:01:22.390> ways<00:01:22.660> to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
end there's a couple different ways to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.570 
end there's a couple different ways to
do<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.140> I'll<00:01:23.350> show<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.620> how<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.740> do<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.040> first

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
do that I'll show you how to do it first

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.170 
do that I'll show you how to do it first
let<00:01:24.880> straight<00:01:25.150> edge<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:27.670> basically<00:01:28.000> just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
let straight edge we're basically just

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.910 
let straight edge we're basically just
lining<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.900> up<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.290> line<00:01:29.530> through<00:01:29.830> the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
lining it up with the line through the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.220 
lining it up with the line through the
mark<00:01:30.130> down<00:01:30.310> there<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:31.960> can<00:01:34.020> hold<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.170> in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
mark down there and we can hold it in

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.080 
mark down there and we can hold it in
place<00:01:35.380> till<00:01:35.770> we<00:01:35.800> get<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> line<00:01:36.310> marked<00:01:39.090> taking

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
place till we get a line marked taking

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
place till we get a line marked taking
it<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.390> high<00:01:40.540> spot<00:01:40.840> here

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.570 

you<00:01:50.110> can<00:01:50.260> always<00:01:50.410> come<00:01:50.740> back<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.070> check<00:01:51.370> your

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
you can always come back to check your

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.170 
you can always come back to check your
width<00:01:52.140> looking<00:01:53.140> for<00:01:53.350> three<00:01:53.590> inch<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.910> little

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
width looking for three inch or a little

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.640 
width looking for three inch or a little
better<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.470> we've<00:01:56.590> got

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:25.430 

right<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.670> money

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.050 

so<00:02:26.440> now<00:02:26.590> we'll<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:26.800> roll<00:02:27.160> along<00:02:27.310> over<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:27.940> do

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
so now we'll just roll along over and do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.990 
so now we'll just roll along over and do
the<00:02:28.150> same<00:02:28.180> thing<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> other<00:02:28.870> side

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.460 

seeing<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.270> log<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.720> almost<00:02:36.959> as<00:02:37.200> tall<00:02:37.410> as

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
seeing as this log is almost as tall as

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.729 
seeing as this log is almost as tall as
me<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.150> very<00:02:39.420> smart<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.140> cut<00:02:40.620> over

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
so now we'll just flip this thing over

00:03:23.879 --> 00:04:26.270 
so now we'll just flip this thing over
and<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.989> again

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.159 

let's<00:04:27.280> take<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> closer<00:04:27.789> look<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:28.720> hog<00:04:28.930> which

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
let's take a closer look this hog which

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
them up for the table and the benches so

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.000 
them up for the table and the benches so
we<00:04:48.750> our<00:04:48.780> table<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.380> these<00:04:49.470> two<00:04:49.710> will<00:04:49.860> become

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
we our table and these two will become

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.400 
we our table and these two will become
our<00:04:50.310> benches<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.690> let<00:04:51.780> me<00:04:51.840> take<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> minute<00:04:52.260> and

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
our benches so let me take a minute and

our benches so let me take a minute and
show<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.710> how<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.920> make<00:04:53.130> me<00:04:53.220> we're<00:04:53.670> going<00:04:53.790> to
