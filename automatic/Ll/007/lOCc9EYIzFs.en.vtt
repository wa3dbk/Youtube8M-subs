00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it's these turn lanes that suck when you

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.140 
it's these turn lanes that suck when you
go<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.950> get<00:04:26.070> into<00:04:26.220> turn<00:04:26.400> lane<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.030> all

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150

especially<00:05:17.979> in<00:05:18.069> their<00:05:18.189> hybrids<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:19.419> is

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
especially in their hybrids but this is

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.669

what<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.259> pilots<00:05:29.589> for<00:05:29.770> but<00:05:30.659> when<00:05:31.659> you<00:05:31.749> compare

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
what the pilots for but when you compare

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.480 
what the pilots for but when you compare
this<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.319> aural<00:05:32.649> driving<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.039> CRV<00:05:33.459> and
