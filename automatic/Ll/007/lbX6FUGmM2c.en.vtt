we<00:00:42.559> grow<00:00:42.739> several<00:00:43.010> different<00:00:43.460> types<00:00:43.610> of

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
we grow several different types of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.950 
we grow several different types of
plants<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.270> we<00:00:44.329> also<00:00:44.450> grow<00:00:44.690> them<00:00:44.899> in

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
plants and we also grow them in

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.540 
plants and we also grow them in
different<00:00:45.110> types<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.530> containers<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.460> we

different types of containers and we

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.220 
different types of containers and we
also<00:00:46.700> do<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.090> bare<00:00:47.329> root<00:00:47.539> plan<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:47.989> see<00:00:48.140> on

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
also do a bare root plan that you see on

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.200 
also do a bare root plan that you see on
the<00:00:48.350> end<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.770> variant<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.520> simply<00:00:49.789> a<00:00:49.820> plant<00:00:50.120> that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
the end a variant is simply a plant that

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.779 
the end a variant is simply a plant that
is<00:00:50.329> has<00:00:50.930> no<00:00:51.200> soil<00:00:51.410> on<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:51.950> you<00:00:52.430> can<00:00:52.550> only<00:00:52.670> be

is has no soil on it and you can only be

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.100 
is has no soil on it and you can only be
planted<00:00:53.120> there<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.390> winter<00:00:53.660> months<00:00:53.930> when

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
planted there in the winter months when

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.200 
planted there in the winter months when
the<00:00:54.170> plants<00:00:54.469> dormant<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.879> plants

the plants dormant and that plants

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.060 
the plants dormant and that plants
typically<00:00:56.660> cheaper<00:00:56.840> but<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:57.920> gonna<00:00:58.010> require

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
typically cheaper but it's gonna require

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.520 
inch we do a 4 inch by 4 inch by 10 inch
and<00:01:20.090> then<00:01:20.420> like<00:01:20.569> I<00:01:20.690> said<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.959> also<00:01:21.110> do<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.410> bare

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
and then like I said we also do the bare

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.180 
and then like I said we also do the bare
root<00:01:21.880> okay<00:01:22.880> now<00:01:23.149> when<00:01:23.300> you<00:01:23.420> say<00:01:23.660> five<00:01:24.470> seven

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
root okay now when you say five seven

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.760 
root okay now when you say five seven
one<00:01:25.459> are<00:01:25.819> these<00:01:26.030> gallon<00:01:26.450> sizes<00:01:26.690> no<00:01:27.410> not

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
one are these gallon sizes no not

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.199 
one are these gallon sizes no not
anymore<00:01:27.979> we<00:01:28.369> used<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.670> use<00:01:28.849> that<00:01:28.880> measurement

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
anymore we used to use that measurement

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.900 
anymore we used to use that measurement
back<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.750> old<00:01:29.929> days<00:01:30.140> but<00:01:30.740> lot<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.700> pots

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
back in the old days but lot of the pots

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.160 
back in the old days but lot of the pots
they<00:01:32.090> were<00:01:32.179> making<00:01:32.360> just<00:01:32.750> buried<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
they were making just buried in the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.960 
they were making just buried in the
mounts<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.500> soil<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.459> had<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.759> start

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
mounts of soil so we had to start

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.029 
mounts of soil so we had to start
assigning<00:01:35.209> numbers<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.720> them<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.739> these

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
assigning numbers to them and and these

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.440 
assigning numbers to them and and these
numbers<00:01:37.369> started<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.759> low<00:01:37.910> number<00:01:38.209> and<00:01:38.239> go

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
numbers started a low number and go

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.969 
numbers started a low number and go
higher<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.020> as<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.200> higher<00:01:39.349> the<00:01:39.530> number<00:01:39.560> gets

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
higher and as the higher the number gets

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.850 
higher and as the higher the number gets
the<00:01:40.429> bigger<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.819> container<00:01:41.119> size<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.679> all

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
the bigger the container size so all

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.680 
the bigger the container size so all
