00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.019
 me they are basically only 2 3 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.870
 colors because there is a cold shade 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.299
 there is a warm shade that is i 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 to a large extent lipstick is not 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.060
 experimenting well and here let's 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.260
 let's see that is this team that their 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 three in one than i like it this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 that they contain three components at once 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.669
 this lip balm see he goes with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 midway 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.100
 lip gloss is just bordering 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 ring is glitter and proper 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.579
 pomade 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.760
 the third layer of the word gia is patented 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 by oriflame for the first time provided 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.309
 lipstick was released by oriflame 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.219
 Here I have such a shade foxy and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 if i open another lipstick 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.360
 he too she will be practically 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.890
 The shades of upsin are a little bit different 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.910
 option here the balm goes see 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.129
 second circuit 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.560
 here are slightly different shades and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 darker brighter 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.409
 one more shade which is very similar to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.770
 these is a red note like that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.509
 red here it is this shade is for 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 I love lip gloss 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.119
 because they quickly applied well 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.350
 lie on the lips and i have one more 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.710
 shine love is the same cubes stage 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 if the lips are steady then there is a series of velmy 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.890
 and when I nanoshu manifests ie 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 He is colorless but on us Shona choice 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.509
 becomes bright or sneaker 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.870
 berry red is another bless which 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.530
 I have this zhordania 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.230
 You see how beautiful he is in a tube 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.130
 already wiped a little bit yes and then I 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.050
 I get it he is completely transparent and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.740
 when I put it almost invisible 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.580
 on lips 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.490
 but what I didn't like is that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.890
 see him very bright shade so I 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.150
 I thought when I spent this shine that he 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.869
 will be much brighter 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.870
 and so he gives such a transparent sheen on 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.850
 lips with a pink tint so shade 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.180
 fuchsias and such sparkling particles 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.280
 there are golden ones in this line 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.320
 I put it on now when that evening on 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.210
 walk for example yes I do not want the cup 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.950
 once there is a special yes I already have it 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.770
 found this shine 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.950
 He for such an express option so 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.560
 let's say well, so here's the evening shine I do not 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.080
 liked maybe just die me 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.660
 too pale remained with me 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.040
 presented again 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.860

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.989

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.940
 coral color that's the principle and found 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.400

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 I like it she likes drawing 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.620
 it goes without flavors and perfumes 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.680

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 happy at all hysterical just not for me 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.440
 it seems to me the only lipstick here 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.080
 besides brilliance but also because i'm not 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.010

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.840

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.700

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.110
 crept up and the warm shade remained 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.360
 pleased with my lip balm 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.270
