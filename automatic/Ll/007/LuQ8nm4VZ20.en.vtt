00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.300
 just as you are welcome to a new 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.520
 video this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.530
 a super great application for 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.650
 devices with ios is an application 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.910
 that is photography is called kahn and is 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.939
 an application that will allow us 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.160
 make pictures much easier much 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.560
 so much better so let's go to 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.060
 enter here to the application and this is 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.350
 the interface of the application you will 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.670
 it agrees well we have the camera 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.740
 front let's put the camera 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.029
 back and well then that's how 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.080
 this application works the only thing that 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.180
 we must do is put our 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.040
 device like this when we put our hand 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.059
 close it and then capture a 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.059
 photography in three seconds 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 then to her as you can realize 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.830
 we would have our picture here is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 you just have to open your hand to close it 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.560
 and it's already captured via photography in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 three seconds as he had told them 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.330
 we also have other modes for example 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100
 we also have the photo wood mode so 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 that we would have to do the same in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 this case are going to capture three 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.920
 photographs then 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.190
 let's hope he knows the hand 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.620
 and ready and we would have our 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.960
 photography and how can you tell 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.330
 then he took three photographs and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.580
 were left so we would give in six 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.380
 and it would be saved on the reel too 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.200
 we have another mode that is called fans and 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 this is a little more like for children 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 we would have the same way 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.550
 well then here we would have 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.990
 after that accommodate the photograph and so 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.990
 it's how it would look 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.330
 this image of a lion the lion king and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.799
 then they would be all 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.380
 our photographs that we have captured 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.970
 also and good as it was when 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 principle we could also capture 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.140
 images with the front camera only 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.409
 we must put our hand like that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.409
 way 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.750
 let's see is that I think that only 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.830
 can from the other to the side the back hand 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.830
 shit let's make them put together 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 we have to wait for him to make that sound 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.359
 sissy 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.709
 will be for good light yes good idea 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.569
 is that you good practice it in your 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.390
 house has had some failures this 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.189
 minimal application I hope that with a 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.629
 future update and improve it well 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.159
 good to remember that the application is 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.720
 called cam and is an application that is 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.510
 Free is only available for 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.989
 devices with ios 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.400
 unfortunately, it is not 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.609
 available for devices with android 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.930

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.200
