00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.510
 little ones I think that in our plan 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.240
 studies a student can find 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.400
 two fundamental differentiating aspects 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.739
 the first one is our program 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.920

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.040
 worker more 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.070
 the second differential aspect is the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.710
 possibility of doing part of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.200

 we have an agreement which makes the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.640
 uicc is a different university for 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.670
 the student is the fact that the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.720

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.470
 the proximity and contact between students 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.690

 what are the advantages of studying in English 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.860
 the international focus on studies 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.050
 of DNA the uicc arises from the evidence that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 nowadays business activity is 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.290
 develops in a global context this is 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.540
 what has led us to offer the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.720
 possibility that the student can 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.830
 develop your studies of ade in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.570
 English language so that develops by 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.300
 the professional competences that 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.060

 talent and effort are not proposed in 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.110
 the leitmotiv of the uicc as something that 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:17.700
 have to have a person and already 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.909
 are proposed as a future project 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.150
 something that people can incorporate

 and develop in your life project and it's 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.489
 there where it seems to us that the uicc can 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.519
 collaborate with that development by helping 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.920
 the people to develop their talent and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.190
 to also develop their capacity to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.109
