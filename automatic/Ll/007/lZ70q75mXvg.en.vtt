00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
this right now hang on there because

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.450 
this right now hang on there because
there<00:00:53.089> is<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.239> whole<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.870> know<00:00:53.929> if<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:55.039> do<00:00:55.249> it

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
there is a whole you know if I can do it

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.149 
there is a whole you know if I can do it
you<00:00:55.940> guys<00:00:56.089> can<00:00:56.120> do<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.889> first

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
you guys can do it to it and the first

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.669 
you guys can do it to it and the first
step<00:00:58.519> here<00:00:58.909> is<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.359> actually<00:00:59.539> try<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.109> accept

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
step here is to actually try to accept

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.789 
step here is to actually try to accept
it<00:01:00.889> because<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.269> more<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.749> deny<00:01:03.109> it<00:01:03.139> the<00:01:03.589> more

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
it because the more you deny it the more

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.750 
it because the more you deny it the more
you<00:01:03.889> fight<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.519> then<00:01:05.290> that's<00:01:06.290> giving<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.430> much

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
you fight it then that's giving you much

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.030 
you fight it then that's giving you much
more<00:01:08.030> hard<00:01:08.330> time<00:01:08.690> so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.030 

it<00:01:12.160> can<00:01:12.730> be<00:01:12.910> done<00:01:13.120> okay<00:01:13.690> let's<00:01:14.200> let's<00:01:14.500> say<00:01:14.740> it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
it can be done okay let's let's say it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.940 
it can be done okay let's let's say it
will<00:01:15.820> be<00:01:16.030> better<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.900> will<00:01:17.170> be<00:01:17.230> better<00:01:17.500> for<00:01:17.800> you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
medicines and about four to six months

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.219 
medicines and about four to six months
after<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.429> my<00:01:57.789> skin<00:01:58.240> actually<00:01:58.720> cleared<00:01:59.049> up

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
after that my skin actually cleared up

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.850 
after that my skin actually cleared up
but<00:01:59.649> as<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.940> guys<00:02:01.090> probably<00:02:01.289> imagine<00:02:02.289> I<00:02:02.530> have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
but as you guys probably imagine I have

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.969 
but as you guys probably imagine I have
you<00:02:03.640> know<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:04.209> speeded<00:02:04.630> scars<00:02:04.959> here<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.950> I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
you know the speeded scars here so I

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.370 
you know the speeded scars here so I
stopped<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.520> medications<00:02:07.450> after<00:02:07.929> six<00:02:08.170> months

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
stopped the medications after six months

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.690 
stopped the medications after six months
and<00:02:10.980> when<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.100> was<00:02:12.280> about<00:02:13.049> 18<00:02:14.049> years<00:02:14.319> old<00:02:14.739> sorry

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and when I was about 18 years old sorry

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.050 
and when I was about 18 years old sorry
my<00:02:16.599> clear<00:02:17.049> skin<00:02:17.530> lasts<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.160> about<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.400> year<00:02:18.880> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
my clear skin lasts for about a year and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.009 
my clear skin lasts for about a year and
after<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.670> started<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.269> break<00:02:22.599> out<00:02:22.810> again

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
after that it started to break out again

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.449 
after that it started to break out again
so<00:02:23.799> when<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.489> 18<00:02:24.940> years<00:02:24.970> old<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.660> have

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459
