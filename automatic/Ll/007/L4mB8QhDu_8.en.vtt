00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.320
 this time I ride 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.290
 careful today is that change the position 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.290
 shooting 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.540
 he should not repeat the play more than a 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.210
 because in this way it would facilitate 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.519
 work of the goalkeeper 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.519
 very well today looking for the right time 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.210
 now I have to walk 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 it is absurd 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.280
 but it was not a hoax 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 Let's go with my attempt 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.570
 ah 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.620
 d 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.620
 good throw 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 focus immediately 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.740
 why 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.750
 it is not possible but it is phenomenal 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.600
 and success 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.729
 the sunrise porter 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.990
 where did it come from 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.610
 to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.590
 but as he has done 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.950
 even though he was in a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.950
 state 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.950
 i 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.780
 d 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 fabulous 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.459
 phenomenally well how will he have gotten 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.709
 stop that value I do not understand either 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.910
 for you but warner is definitely better 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.640
 that you or they are from the north 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.280
 and who knows, it could even be better 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.970
 that our bng and the very fast in his 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.440
 movements and has a great intuition 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.890
 The truth is that he is not a goalkeeper 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.890
 current 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.350
 his parents have a karate gym 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.530
 and the acquired the agile movements and 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.280
 very fast of this sport even before 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.280
 to learn 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.690
 in karate you have to be controlling the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.090
 contrary continuously in own 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.640
 points and be able to instruct the tactics of 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.640
 opponent's attack and communicate it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.450
 she 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.379
 that's why it's incredibly fast and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.379
 precise in their stops 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.349
 as it has been in this last shot 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.650
 that for anyone else it would have been 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.650
 unstoppable
