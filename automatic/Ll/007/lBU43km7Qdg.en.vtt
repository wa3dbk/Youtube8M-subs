that's<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:04.299> way<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.570> politics<00:03:05.049> is<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.500> now

that's the way the politics is right now

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.100 
that's the way the politics is right now
it's<00:03:06.310> really<00:03:06.670> hindering<00:03:07.269> us<00:03:07.390> from<00:03:07.780> being<00:03:07.959> in

it's really hindering us from being in
the<00:03:08.230> Olympics<00:03:08.440> instead<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.160> helping<00:03:09.549> us<00:03:09.730> I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
the Olympics instead of helping us I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.140 
the Olympics instead of helping us I
think<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.620> lot<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.799> new<00:03:11.950> things<00:03:12.070> must<00:03:13.060> change

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
think a lot of new things must change

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.810 
think a lot of new things must change
before<00:03:13.660> we<00:03:13.989> can<00:03:14.170> reach<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.590> point<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.670> now

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
before we can reach that point and now

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.479 
before we can reach that point and now
this<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.360> week<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.230> Olympics<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.980> mean

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
powerlifting well I want to think of it

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.860 
powerlifting well I want to think of it
on<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.690> positive<00:05:36.380> note<00:05:36.410> it's<00:05:37.130> been<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:37.310> girl<00:05:37.870> but

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
on a positive note it's been a girl but

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.620 
on a positive note it's been a girl but
we<00:05:39.110> have<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.380> get<00:05:39.640> lifters<00:05:40.640> really<00:05:41.030> supporting

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
we have to get lifters really supporting

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.010 
we have to get lifters really supporting
their<00:05:42.169> organization<00:05:43.100> and<00:05:43.419> we<00:05:44.419> have<00:05:44.600> to<00:05:44.720> unite

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
their organization and we have to unite

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.980 
their organization and we have to unite
I<00:05:45.080> think<00:05:45.530> powerlifting<00:05:46.460> if<00:05:47.419> we<00:05:47.600> could<00:05:47.750> band

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
I think powerlifting if we could band

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.170 
I think powerlifting if we could band
together<00:05:48.190> we're<00:05:49.190> only<00:05:49.370> we're<00:05:49.729> only<00:05:49.910> going<00:05:50.120> to

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
together we're only we're only going to

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.960 
together we're only we're only going to
become<00:05:50.540> stronger<00:05:50.950> years<00:05:51.950> ago<00:05:52.340> when<00:05:52.640> I<00:05:52.669> started

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
become stronger years ago when I started

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.540 
become stronger years ago when I started
out<00:05:53.270> we<00:05:53.570> only<00:05:53.690> had<00:05:53.930> one<00:05:54.140> Federation<00:05:54.770> now<00:05:54.800> who

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
out we only had one Federation now who

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.010 
out we only had one Federation now who
knows<00:05:55.729> how<00:05:55.910> many<00:05:55.970> Federation's<00:05:56.630> there<00:05:56.840> are

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
knows how many Federation's there are

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.040 
knows how many Federation's there are
but<00:05:57.830> I<00:05:58.400> think<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.210> only<00:05:59.450> way<00:05:59.600> we're<00:05:59.870> going<00:05:59.990> to

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
but I think the only way we're going to

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.540 
but I think the only way we're going to
really<00:06:00.320> grow<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:00.860> sport<00:06:01.280> is<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.550> unite

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
really grow as a sport is to unite
