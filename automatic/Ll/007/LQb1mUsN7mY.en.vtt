I<00:02:33.769> was<00:02:34.040> expecting<00:02:34.370> at<00:02:34.459> least<00:02:34.489> one<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.440> go

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.940 

okay<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.360> you've<00:02:53.540> done<00:02:53.570> TV<00:02:54.050> you're<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.890> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
okay so you've done TV you're going to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.650 
okay so you've done TV you're going to
be<00:02:55.040> doing<00:02:55.130> radio<00:02:55.370> you're<00:02:56.060> gonna<00:02:56.180> prefer<00:02:56.360> doing

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
be doing radio you're gonna prefer doing

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.540 
be doing radio you're gonna prefer doing
TV<00:02:56.930> or<00:02:57.290> radio<00:02:57.440> because<00:02:57.980> there's<00:02:58.100> dressing<00:02:58.400> up

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
TV or radio because there's dressing up

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.290 
TV or radio because there's dressing up
and<00:02:58.760> there's<00:02:58.880> dressing<00:02:59.180> down<00:02:59.620> you<00:03:00.620> can't<00:03:01.300> make

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
and there's dressing down you can't make

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.730 
and there's dressing down you can't make
up<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.630> stray<00:03:02.810> DeHart<00:03:03.110> it's<00:03:03.410> gonna<00:03:03.530> be<00:03:03.710> a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
up a stray DeHart it's gonna be a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.660 
up a stray DeHart it's gonna be a
massive<00:03:04.100> benefit<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.970> radio<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:07.310> think

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
massive benefit of radio and I think

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.940 
massive benefit of radio and I think
it's<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.940> much<00:03:08.180> harder<00:03:08.540> thing<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.290> master

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's a much harder thing to master

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.060 
it's a much harder thing to master
actually<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.120> if<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.570> in<00:03:12.170> fact<00:03:12.560> swim

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
actually so if I if I do in fact swim

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.890 
actually so if I if I do in fact swim
rather<00:03:13.400> than<00:03:13.610> sink<00:03:13.880> then<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.300> think<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.660> will

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
rather than sink then I think I will

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.540 
rather than sink then I think I will
feel<00:03:15.500> as<00:03:15.650> though<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.800> have<00:03:15.890> more<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.340> brain

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
feel as though I have more of a brain

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.640 
feel as though I have more of a brain
like<00:03:16.760> TV<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.180> difficult<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:17.960> and<00:03:18.440> there's<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
like TV is difficult and and there's a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.230 
like TV is difficult and and there's a
lot<00:03:18.830> involved<00:03:19.280> with<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.000> lot<00:03:20.180> of

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
lot involved with it and it's a lot of

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240 
lot involved with it and it's a lot of
fun<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.690> well<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.350> think<00:03:21.620> there's<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.040> real

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
fun as well but I think there's a real

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.070 
fun as well but I think there's a real
art<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.760> radio<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.330> getting<00:03:23.540> people<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.840> trust

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
art to radio to getting people to trust

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.300 
art to radio to getting people to trust
you<00:03:24.260> already<00:03:24.530> because<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.800> really<00:03:24.950> invasive

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you already because it's really invasive

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.880 
you already because it's really invasive

like you're in people's homes in their
cars<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.520> lot<00:03:28.670> more<00:03:28.790> personal<00:03:29.030> than<00:03:29.540> TV

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780
