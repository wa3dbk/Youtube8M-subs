00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
second ingredient is a trans fat

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.050 
second ingredient is a trans fat
typically<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.170> true<00:02:38.530> yes<00:02:38.680> also<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.790> says

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
typically that is true yes also it says

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.240 
typically that is true yes also it says
what<00:02:40.390> health<00:02:40.720> healthy<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:41.440> oatmeal<00:02:41.769> and

reason<00:02:42.579> what<00:02:42.760> could<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.000> wrong<00:02:43.150> with<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.599> but

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
reason what could be wrong with that but

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.400 
reason what could be wrong with that but
I<00:02:44.380> hope<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.890> right<00:02:45.670> trans<00:02:46.209> fat<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.750> have<00:02:47.019> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
I hope this right trans fat you have to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.729 
I hope this right trans fat you have to
go<00:02:47.739> in<00:02:48.450> reading<00:02:49.450> labels<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.319> don't<00:02:50.530> read

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
go in reading labels if you don't read

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:51.839 
go in reading labels if you don't read
labels<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.220> don't<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.489> what<00:02:51.670> you're

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
labels you don't know what you're

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.509 
labels you don't know what you're
getting<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.480> says<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.959> no<00:02:53.709> cholesterol<00:02:54.099> so

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
getting it says here no cholesterol so

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.420 
getting it says here no cholesterol so
you're<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:54.730> oh<00:02:54.849> no<00:02:55.680> trans<00:02:56.680> fat

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
you're like oh no trans fat

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.830 
you're like oh no trans fat
now<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> guess<00:02:58.180> by<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.569> if<00:02:58.720> you're

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
now I guess by the way if you're

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.780 
now I guess by the way if you're
wondering<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.470> says<00:02:59.739> hydrogenated<00:03:00.610> that's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
wondering it says hydrogenated that's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.520 
wondering it says hydrogenated that's
how<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.090> partially<00:03:01.410> hydrogenated<00:03:02.410> that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
how you know partially hydrogenated that

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.259 
how you know partially hydrogenated that
means<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:03.160> were<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.549> that's<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> trans<00:03:04.030> fat

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
means that were you that's a trans fat

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.900 
means that were you that's a trans fat
remember<00:03:04.930> five<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.920> process<00:03:06.370> lunch<00:03:06.640> meats

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
remember five is a process lunch meats

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.520 
remember five is a process lunch meats
and<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.299> hot<00:03:07.480> dogs<00:03:07.690> are<00:03:07.900> really<00:03:08.019> dad<00:03:08.319> it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and we know hot dogs are really dad it's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.979 
and we know hot dogs are really dad it's
the<00:03:08.620> worst<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.519> any<00:03:09.790> pork<00:03:10.180> product<00:03:10.630> has<00:03:10.750> got

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
the worst but any pork product has got

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.229 
the worst but any pork product has got
nitrates<00:03:11.500> in<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.769> cancer-causing<00:03:12.430> now<00:03:13.180> we

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
nitrates in it cancer-causing now we

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.599 
nitrates in it cancer-causing now we
move<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.780> vine<00:03:14.109> popcorn<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.160> five<00:03:15.370> that

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
move to the vine popcorn the five that

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.059 
move to the vine popcorn the five that
we<00:03:15.700> think<00:03:16.030> are<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> little<00:03:16.299> bit<00:03:16.600> healthier

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
we think are a little bit healthier

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.129 
we think are a little bit healthier
popcorn<00:03:18.069> is<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.549> good<00:03:19.180> food<00:03:19.540> it's<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> whole

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
popcorn is a is a good food it's a whole

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.780 
popcorn is a is a good food it's a whole
food<00:03:20.470> but<00:03:21.010> when<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.220> put<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
food but when you put it in the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.569 
food but when you put it in the
microwave<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.569> if<00:03:23.109> it's<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.799> packages<00:03:24.400> that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
microwave and if it's in packages that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.900 
microwave and if it's in packages that
contain<00:03:24.940> concert<00:03:25.780> cancer-causing<00:03:26.910> chemicals

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
contain concert cancer-causing chemicals

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.879 
contain concert cancer-causing chemicals
once<00:03:28.150> they're<00:03:28.389> heated<00:03:28.840> also<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.680> butter

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
once they're heated also the butter

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.780 
once they're heated also the butter
flavor<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.579> also<00:03:31.530> cancer-causing<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.190> if<00:03:33.579> you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
flavor is also cancer-causing so if you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.120
