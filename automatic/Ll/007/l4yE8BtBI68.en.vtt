says power flow in and then it does show
up<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.010> lot<00:01:55.100> easier<00:01:56.110> which<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.260> all<00:01:57.409> well<00:01:57.560> and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
up a lot easier which is all well and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.160 
up a lot easier which is all well and
good<00:01:57.800> if<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.480> do<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.780> but<00:01:59.960> if<00:02:00.080> you

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
good if you can do that but if you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.890 
good if you can do that but if you
