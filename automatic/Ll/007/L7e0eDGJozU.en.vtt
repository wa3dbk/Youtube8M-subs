Michael<00:02:49.280> Jackson<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.299> one<00:02:50.480> thing<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.620> got

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
Michael Jackson the one thing that I got

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.690 
Michael Jackson the one thing that I got
was<00:02:52.540> awareness<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> audience<00:02:54.700> because

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
was awareness of the audience because

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.309 
was awareness of the audience because
his<00:02:55.880> show<00:02:56.090> was<00:02:56.299> so<00:02:56.690> much<00:02:56.870> more<00:02:57.049> than<00:02:57.170> music

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
his show was so much more than music

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.970 
his show was so much more than music
that<00:02:57.590> was<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:57.830> one<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.190> elements<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:59.150> was

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that was just one of the elements it was

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.039 
that was just one of the elements it was
entertainment<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.370> every<00:03:01.819> level<00:03:02.030> from<00:03:02.450> dance

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
entertainment on every level from dance

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.840 
entertainment on every level from dance
to<00:03:04.030> one-of-a-kind<00:03:05.739> stage<00:03:06.739> props<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.700> that

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
to one-of-a-kind stage props so that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.930 
to one-of-a-kind stage props so that
that<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:08.989> at<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.680> probably<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.700> why<00:03:10.910> I

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that really at that probably is why I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.000 
that really at that probably is why I
ended<00:03:11.359> up<00:03:11.540> doing<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.870> film<00:03:12.109> because<00:03:12.799> it's<00:03:12.950> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
ended up doing the film because it's a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.590 
ended up doing the film because it's a
lot<00:03:13.190> more<00:03:13.310> entertaining<00:03:13.489> than<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.299> watch<00:03:14.450> me

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
lot more entertaining than just watch me

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
lot more entertaining than just watch me
play<00:03:14.750> guitar<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.380> think<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.130> thing<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.760> I

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
play guitar I think the one thing that I

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.240 
play guitar I think the one thing that I
learned<00:03:16.940> from<00:03:17.030> Jeff<00:03:17.299> Beck<00:03:17.540> was<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.859> value<00:03:19.160> of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
learned from Jeff Beck was the value of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.030 
learned from Jeff Beck was the value of
