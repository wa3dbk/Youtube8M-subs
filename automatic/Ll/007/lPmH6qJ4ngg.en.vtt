00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello everyone welcome on jeuxactu on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 is still cramped 2015 here at los 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 angeles with Laura and bound this time 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 we will talk about Nintendo Nintendo 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.390
 who organized his famous digital events 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 in response to sony and microsoft with their 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 conference that's always going on 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.050
 scene 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 so we know for a few years 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740
 nintendo no longer does not ride anymore 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 scene in any case for to announce these 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.679
 games they went on a format 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 digital a format so the famous 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.110
 digital event that takes place on 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 Internet 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 what is the advantage of this laurely format 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 down is to control his communication 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 of work and its staging because 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.430
 well, no, no, it's not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 subjected to direct pressure as they 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 could be microsoft and sony okay 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 just being able to do that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 it's to master his subject as you 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.820
 say but this year it was not the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 case everyone agrees to say 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 that nintendo missed the nintendo tick 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 was not at the rendezvous why their 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.359
 bed why that's why he was not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 the see the ads were not 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.550
 terrible it was not so good 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.619
 what did we do what we could 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 discover twenty two animal crossing a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.610
 smile or who goes who will exploit the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.210
 miba who will look like a mario party 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.300
 1 / 3ds then that will in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 played the decorator 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.350
 indoor in fact so here is there 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.540
 also a new soldier triforce heroes 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 which is also announced the famous starfox 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.240
 with you who was renamed starfox 0 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.400
 is also a tennis mario also announced 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.020
 on wii where we were also entitled to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.760
 other games style and xenoblade 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 chronicles x that had already been 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.400
 announced fire emblem but in 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.630
 all we can be big games is 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.980
 pretty paradoxical because that's when 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.230
 even big licenses from 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.910
 nintendo so why is it disappointing 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.650
 quoted me a zelda tunis is an animal 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.630
 crossing stafford is xenoblade 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.890
 these are big nintendo games are some 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.250
 wholesalers years so why was it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.990
 years 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.130
 so much because in fact 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.400
 these are not licenses also that are 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.500
 sell 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.270
 finally who will allow nintendo 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.320
 to sell off stocks of wu 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.420
 we know very well that in Hawaii or 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.370
 suffer in sales smash bros 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.920
 released last year mario kart 8 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.780
 also they allowed the console to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.080
 take off a little slightly in the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.580
 sales 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.869
 but we were expecting big when you 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.399
 know that a zelda or ue that has been 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.670
 developed finally that a development on 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.620
 Wii U 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.990
 when you know we would like their author 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 big licenses like f01 nintendo 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.320
 had not been leaked 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.209
 when that can be the case for for 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.190
 microsoft and sony so just palate 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.480
 who bet everything their card they 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 play their best card their 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.330
 best assets to get out of the big 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 games and finally give up little game 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.720
 animal crossing yes good it's nice 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 it's nice but yes it's finally 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.360
 really hungry to measure the gauge I 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.410
 think it's not necessarily small 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.180
 games but I think it's not 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.890
 games that are they have their place 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.720
 here to 3 to make an effect 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.670
 to announce the famous huawei effect 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.800
 is that avoidance at a 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 conference we need strong titles 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.920
 who mark their tendent it was not 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.989
 necessarily the case animal crossing knows 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.920
 the license of course xenon hurts and is 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.060
 already announced so it's true that this 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.830
 are games that are already known that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.300
 have already been unveiled there are some 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.130
 month so there was not this effect 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.260
 of announcement it was surprise party of course 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.720
 i think that today nintendo if they 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 pay the fact of not to multiply the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.810
 nintendo live since the beginning of 2006 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.100
 a choice that had three or four 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.170
 nintendo live so every time 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.459
 nintendo announces new titles they 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.710
 have not necessarily kept the best 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.660
 for 7.3 as we say huh 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.010
 the 3 is a little bit the world of 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.510
 the car in video game version so 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.070
 we are here to take full view 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.440
 to dream and so they do not have 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.580
 necessarily made the right choices of any 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.190
 way when you see that the president 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.170
 satoru iwata satoru iwata right after 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.880
 India and our direct response to fans 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.920
 were who were unhappy that 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.450
 told them here we apologize flatly 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.380
 we'll do better next year it's okay 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.630
 to say that he recognizes 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 himself that 1 and 1 2 a missed his sense 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.160
 word the worst being I think the famous 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.810
 metroid prime the new on 3ds had 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.300
 two r1 that brings together a football game 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.340
 it's great and so there are bound to be 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.110
 disappointed the fans and today even there are 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.280
 a petition circulating online for 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.790
 that we cancel the development that's 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.140
 quite serious 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.430
 must not exaggerate but it's 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.530
 true that it's true that it shows a 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.570
 little bit of that is the discontent of the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.310
 players like how much nintendo has 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.960
 disappointed people there yes because retro 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.880
 studio that deals with metroid premium 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.240
 had announced that he was working on a 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.600
 new game 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.970
 nobody thought it was not 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.870
 plus a version as light and this one 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.280
 no but I think that anyway 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.780
 Nintendo has moved on 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.830
 they said they are in the process of 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.470
 work on the new console the 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.030
 famous project enix will also happen 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.640
 on mobile so I think nintendo 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.810
 is also very busy developing 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.520
 on his new console efforts 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.680
 money the budget is put and on 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.870
 everything will be unveiled in 2016 so I think 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.850
 that we are really in a transition 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.130
 here is nintendo today the wii u on 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.480
 know it did not sell well this is the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.250
 last of the consoles today with 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.750
 exceed them except the ps4 and xbox mag 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.790
 so she came out two years before 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.180
 so I think now they 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.590
 know 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.990
 she is the wiiu and more or less 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.770
 condemned once again the zelda that has 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.840
 been delayed 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.430
 I think he will not come out on 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 You do not just have to wiiu 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.640
 I do not know what he really is 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.990
 based on henning if they will do the 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.640
 same shot that twilight princess me I 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.730
 since the beginning I'm pretty sure 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.510
 and then here it is good it is not necessarily 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.010
 a bad thing 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.450
 they react to that by 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.940
 compared to the market so actually 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.650
 this year in 2015 we were disappointed 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.690
 this of this digital even the year 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.620
 last he had smashed a little bit 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.410
 it was simply the best 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.680
 observer conference had said when 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.780
 it was wonderful 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.810
 what irrigated son loved who 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.070
 clash it was super puma 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.419
 yes good here we can not be at the top 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.310
 every day so good has actually 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.449
 big disappointment on the part of nintendo 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.080
 this year everyone agrees 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.759
 to say it 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 good nevertheless we have an appointment at 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.820
 level but we'll see we'll see the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.500
 games that have been announced we will 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.080
 get hold of it we also have a 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.580
 married woman but heart is for the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.720
 30 years nintendo we will make you 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.060
 discover new handsome friends so 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.490
 stay well connected on gamesactu for 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.449
 other videos are of course here at

 the e3 2015 ciao
