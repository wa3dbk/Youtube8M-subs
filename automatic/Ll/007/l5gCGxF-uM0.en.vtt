three men under Lincoln but three V is

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.930 
three men under Lincoln but three V is
like<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.040> something<00:00:49.660> straight<00:00:50.660> like<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.020> tree

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
like a something straight like a tree

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.400 
like a something straight like a tree
lucida<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> tree<00:00:53.830> and<00:00:55.930> Tonkin<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.080> driving

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
lucida like a tree and Tonkin is driving

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.700 
lucida like a tree and Tonkin is driving
engine<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:58.280> make<00:00:58.519> her<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.059> cream<00:00:59.540> machine<00:01:00.050> you

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
engine to make her the cream machine you

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.580 
engine to make her the cream machine you
know<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.129> move<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.129> tank<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.519> first

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
know the move so the tank and the first

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.390 
know the move so the tank and the first
benefit<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.320> defense<00:01:09.320> attack<00:01:09.830> at<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
benefit is one is defense attack at the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.260 
benefit is one is defense attack at the
same<00:01:10.640> time

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
same time

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.780 
same time
second<00:01:12.170> one<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.620> rotary<00:01:13.070> engine<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.700> he

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
second one is a rotary engine so he

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.120 
second one is a rotary engine so he
continued<00:01:14.330> move<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.320> third<00:01:15.530> one<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:15.950> long

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
continued move and third one is the long

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.960 
continued move and third one is the long
leverage<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> con<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.760> he's<00:01:19.940> in

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
leverage for is a con to it so he's in

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.590 
leverage for is a con to it so he's in
the<00:01:20.390> low<00:01:20.600> position<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:22.640> have<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.850> most<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.360> bridge

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
the low position to have a most a bridge

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.360 
the low position to have a most a bridge
and<00:01:24.410> also<00:01:24.620> the<00:01:25.460> conduit<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:27.220> counter<00:01:28.220> enemy

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
and also the conduit to counter enemy

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.270 
and also the conduit to counter enemy
sports<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.510> this<00:01:29.660> if<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.170> will<00:01:30.470> made<00:01:31.010> your

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
sports so this if I will made your

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.820 
sports so this if I will made your
function<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.960> function<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.840> Tremont<00:01:36.590> is

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
function the function so the Tremont is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.880 
function the function so the Tremont is
in<00:01:37.010> focus<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.700> gravity<00:01:38.240> under<00:01:38.840> loot<00:01:39.050> and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
in focus on the gravity under loot and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.140 
in focus on the gravity under loot and
the<00:01:40.070> focus<00:01:40.460> under<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:42.200> internal<00:01:42.770> change<00:01:43.160> so

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
the focus under the internal change so

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.240 
the focus under the internal change so
it's<00:01:44.330> like<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.570> tree<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:45.710> about<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.010> tree

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
it's like a tree you think about a tree

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.540 
it's like a tree you think about a tree
and<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.420> push<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.870> tree<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.260> can<00:01:48.440> feel<00:01:48.710> the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
and you push the tree you can feel the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.140 
and you push the tree you can feel the
more<00:01:49.850> force<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.360> push<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.020> tree<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.790> tree

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
more force you push the tree the tree

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.900 
more force you push the tree the tree
give<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.930> more<00:01:54.140> forced<00:01:54.530> back<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> tree

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
give you more forced back and the tree

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.930 
give you more forced back and the tree
itself<00:01:56.240> will<00:01:56.810> note<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.350> anything<00:01:57.940> so

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
itself will note that we anything so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.530 
itself will note that we anything so
that<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.960> three<00:02:00.290> men<00:02:00.650> in<00:02:00.890> meaning<00:02:01.490> your<00:02:02.270> root

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
that the three men in meaning your root

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.220 
that the three men in meaning your root
is<00:02:02.870> a<00:02:03.260> very<00:02:03.680> very<00:02:04.130> deep<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:04.790> wide<00:02:05.330> so

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
is a very very deep and very wide so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.229 
is a very very deep and very wide so
when<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> attack<00:02:06.890> people<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.760> have<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.000> think

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
when you attack people you have to think

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.419 
when you attack people you have to think
in<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.539> root<00:02:08.750> your<00:02:09.319> feet<00:02:09.560> are<00:02:10.069> getting<00:02:10.399> bigger

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
in the root your feet are getting bigger

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.600 
in the root your feet are getting bigger
and<00:02:10.910> wider<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.660> deeper<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.190> use<00:02:13.400> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and wider and deeper and then use this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.240 
and wider and deeper and then use this
force<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> tree<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.410> attack<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.920> enemy

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
force like a tree to attack the enemy

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.790 
force like a tree to attack the enemy
the<00:02:16.790> middle<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.330> some<00:02:17.660> deep<00:02:17.870> century

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
the middle is some deep century

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.250 
the middle is some deep century
equilibrium<00:02:19.340> force<00:02:19.580> thus<00:02:20.209> only<00:02:20.390> when<00:02:21.140> you're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
equilibrium force thus only when you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.229 
equilibrium force thus only when you're
standing<00:02:21.620> there<00:02:21.769> naturally<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
standing there naturally just like a

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.780 
standing there naturally just like a
post<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.860> something<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.580> know

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
post is for the something for know

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to the inside have force so we

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.430 
to the inside have force so we
corresponding<00:02:49.580> G<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.540> needed<00:02:50.750> something<00:02:51.080> G

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
corresponding G so we needed something G

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.090 
corresponding G so we needed something G
inside<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.910> post<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.020> our<00:02:54.260> third<00:02:54.500> olive<00:02:54.770> tree

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
inside the post so our third olive tree

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.580 
inside the post so our third olive tree
the<00:02:55.610> inside<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.240> -<00:02:57.050> minguk<00:02:57.760> unhinging<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> this

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the inside is - minguk unhinging so this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.250 
the inside is - minguk unhinging so this
