00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.360
 For who is this time of here theme of Hello world rubber market 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.870
 I think I want to do it 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.450
 Improve your head's multitasking ability 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.830
 I would like to introduce Shiritori table tennis 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.450
 This is right 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.990
 It is a practice method to train my prediction speed 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.020
 And say what it 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.200
 It is good though it is an ordinary forehand or rally 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 It is slowly okay 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.540
 While exchanging words with Shiritori when hitting 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.860
 It is good to play ping pong watermelon 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.590
 It is cut putt went form 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.690
 Table tennis 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.180
 Because that person-to-person competition 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.580
 Toka Naa opponent is in the back 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:59.050
 I wonder if I should go here and think about various things such as this cost 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:04.449
 But I have to play that game I have to play 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:09.200
 Simply selling a soul simply does not work well, or pokes off the other's weakness 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.979
 In the mind of the other party's strong point 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.530
 It is a basic practice to play while thinking 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.740
 That 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 It is a form that is substituted by Shiritori this time 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 Please watch the video 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.480
 bl 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.320
 Welfare bar 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.320
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.020
 Shiritori 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.130
 2 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.970
 add to 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.700
 th 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 Already 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 Rorig 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 After Meetu 5 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.140
 Dragonfly volume gree 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.140
 I mean 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.770
 Shiritori water 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.000
 Sulme hill 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.510
 President Tappa Panda 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.909
 3 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.329
 hero 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.329
 It said, 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.980
 Yes How was the video 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.430
 I can do it well if I think that I can do well by returning such articles in my block 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.109
 Sumi does not did not 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.630
 After all if you think that the soul does not enter 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:34.100
 Shiritori's thing is said to be late or something else 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.360
 If you look at the trajectory of the ball, words will not come out at all 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 was 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 It's a real game 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.910
 Because I have to make the pitch faster and think more 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:54.090
 In fact, I think this alone is a bit short 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.720
 In fact, there is also a case where I think it's too much to say in words that I think it's a shame now. 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.770
 I do not know for a while 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.370
 Play while thinking in your mind 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:12.290
 It will play practice method to train these things 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.290
 So I think that if you can use it for the leader or for the big folk gear up
