00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
is that you do have free application and

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.080 
is that you do have free application and
this<00:00:14.929> is<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.230> task<00:00:15.500> switcher<00:00:16.070> of<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.730> n900

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
this is the task switcher of the n900

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.420 
this is the task switcher of the n900
and<00:00:17.600> what<00:00:18.109> you<00:00:18.289> see<00:00:18.560> are<00:00:18.710> three<00:00:18.980> applications

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
and what you see are three applications

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.580 
and what you see are three applications
we<00:00:19.820> really<00:00:20.300> do<00:00:20.539> look<00:00:20.779> like<00:00:20.840> my<00:00:21.350> more

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
we really do look like my more

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.550 
we really do look like my more
application<00:00:22.220> but<00:00:22.880> are<00:00:23.240> actually<00:00:23.560> some

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
application but are actually some

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.769 
application but are actually some
application<00:00:25.220> coming<00:00:25.519> from<00:00:25.789> Android<00:00:26.179> I<00:00:26.390> can<00:00:26.630> go

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
application coming from Android I can go

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.630 
application coming from Android I can go
for<00:00:26.990> instance<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.560> my<00:00:27.710> google<00:00:28.490> map

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
for instance to my google map

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640 
for instance to my google map
application<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.449> right<00:00:29.869> now<00:00:30.050> it<00:00:30.170> runs<00:00:30.380> in

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
application and right now it runs in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.530 
application and right now it runs in
this<00:00:30.800> mode<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:31.189> I'll<00:00:31.310> turn<00:00:31.519> it<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:32.420> know

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
this mode so I'll turn it and you know

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.510 
this mode so I'll turn it and you know
this<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:32.990> your<00:00:33.200> standard<00:00:33.560> google<00:00:33.920> map<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:34.400> can

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
this is your standard google map you can

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.610 
this is your standard google map you can
look<00:00:34.700> at<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.970> menu<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:35.930> can<00:00:35.960> recognize

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
look at the menu and you can recognize

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.500 
look at the menu and you can recognize
the<00:00:36.860> usual<00:00:37.190> item<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:37.730> you<00:00:37.880> would<00:00:38.030> expect<00:00:38.120> for

the usual item that you would expect for
this<00:00:38.630> type<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.870> application<00:00:39.590> i<00:00:39.830> can<00:00:40.520> go<00:00:40.670> here

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
this type of application i can go here

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.510 
this type of application i can go here

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
a fully functional game here I can black

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.650 
a fully functional game here I can black
eremite<00:00:59.140> okay<00:01:00.140> there<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.620> is<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.660> other

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
eremite okay there it is so other

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.710 
eremite okay there it is so other
application<00:01:03.440> would<00:01:03.680> be<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:04.070> example<00:01:04.400> of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
application would be the example of

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.900 
application would be the example of
Photoshop<00:01:05.720> application<00:01:06.380> which<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.640> image

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
Photoshop application which is the image

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.750 
Photoshop application which is the image
editing<00:01:08.270> application<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.290> Adobe<00:01:09.770> did<00:01:10.520> for

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
editing application that Adobe did for

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.060 
editing application that Adobe did for
Android<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:12.320> application<00:01:13.010> is

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
Android and this application is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.310 
Android and this application is
interesting<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:13.880> us<00:01:13.940> because<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.990> really

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
interesting for us because it is really

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.250 
interesting for us because it is really
an<00:01:16.010> interesting<00:01:16.340> way<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.790> go<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.420> compare<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
an interesting way to go and compare the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260 
an interesting way to go and compare the
performance<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.040> regular<00:01:19.460> Android<00:01:19.850> device

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
performance to a regular Android device

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.180 
performance to a regular Android device
and<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:21.050> we<00:01:21.200> do<00:01:21.350> fine<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.160> actually

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
and what we do fine is that we actually

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.580 
and what we do fine is that we actually
do<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.850> same<00:01:23.120> frame<00:01:23.390> rate<00:01:23.630> for<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.380> same

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
do have the same frame rate for the same

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.400 
do have the same frame rate for the same
type<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.830> hardware<00:01:25.220> as<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:26.390> regular<00:01:27.110> Android

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
type of hardware as a regular Android

type of hardware as a regular Android
type<00:01:27.860> application<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.730> but<00:01:29.510> really<00:01:29.540> nice

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
type application so but really nice

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 
type application so but really nice
email<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.590> key<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.070> there<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.909> no

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
email the key is that there is no

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.360 
email the key is that there is no

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.580 
distinction between legal application
and<00:01:34.610> Android<00:01:35.060> application<00:01:35.690> they<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.110> appear

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
and Android application they just appear

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.740 
and Android application they just appear
in<00:01:36.980> a<00:01:37.100> similar<00:01:37.520> manner<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.060> launch<00:01:38.270> them<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
in a similar manner you launch them in a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.330 
in a similar manner you launch them in a
similar<00:01:39.170> manner<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.650> total

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
similar manner to total

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.760 
similar manner to total
remove<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.909> difference<00:01:41.359> so<00:01:41.649> when<00:01:42.649> you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
remove the difference so when you
