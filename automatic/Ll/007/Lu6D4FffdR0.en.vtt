does not now for our test we're going to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.700 
does not now for our test we're going to
be<00:00:23.400> using<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.060> number<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> different<00:00:24.960> solutions

and<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> reason<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and the reason for that is it's going to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
and the reason for that is it's going to
give<00:00:36.300> us<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> option<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.230> run<00:00:37.440> USB<00:00:38.280> 3<00:00:38.610> in

frequent smaller transactions with the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
frequent smaller transactions with the
drive<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.370> able<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
drive we are also going to be able to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
drive we are also going to be able to
use<00:00:50.789> Thunderbolt<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.809> finally<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:53.010> going

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
use Thunderbolt and finally we're going

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.160 
use Thunderbolt and finally we're going
to<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.309> able<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.699> eSATA<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> five

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to be able to use eSATA so that is five

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
to be able to use eSATA so that is five
different<00:00:55.500> ways<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.219> testing<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.750> drive

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
different ways of testing the same drive

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
different ways of testing the same drive
to<00:00:58.199> find<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.460> performs<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.090> best

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to find out which one performs the best

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
to find out which one performs the best
in<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.960> couple<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> different<00:01:01.649> scenarios<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in a couple of different scenarios the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
in a couple of different scenarios the
two<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.090> scenarios<00:01:03.239> we're<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
two different scenarios we're going to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
two different scenarios we're going to
look<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.379> aq<00:01:04.710> depth<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> 4<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.489> aq<00:01:05.820> depth

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
look at are aq depth of 4 and aq depth

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.899 
look at are aq depth of 4 and aq depth
of<00:01:06.180> 10<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> Q<00:01:07.650> depth<00:01:07.890> means<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of 10 and what the Q depth means the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
of 10 and what the Q depth means the
higher<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.900> Q<00:01:10.110> depth<00:01:10.290> goes<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.159> more

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
higher you your Q depth goes the more

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
higher you your Q depth goes the more
busy<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> drive<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> more<00:01:13.500> things<00:01:13.740> are

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
busy the drive is the more things are

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
busy the drive is the more things are
waiting<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.610> processed<00:01:14.850> while<00:01:15.600> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
waiting to be processed while it's

Seagate flex desk this is a Thunderbolt
Drive<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.860> used<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.549> they're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
Drive and then we used the they're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
Drive and then we used the they're
modular<00:01:45.750> interface<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.680> run<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.159> USB<00:01:47.490> 3<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.090> a

number<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.899> modes<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.290> well<00:01:49.710> as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
number of different modes as well as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
number of different modes as well as
eSATA<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
eSATA and then the other one that we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
eSATA and then the other one that we
have<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> lesea<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.939> big<00:01:54.149> disk<00:01:54.479> with

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have is the lesea little big disk with

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
have is the lesea little big disk with
two<00:01:56.090> 120<00:01:57.090> gig<00:01:57.329> SSDs<00:01:58.079> inside<00:01:58.590> running<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.310> raid

two 120 gig SSDs inside running in raid

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
two 120 gig SSDs inside running in raid
so<00:02:00.240> what's<00:02:00.450> cool<00:02:00.689> about<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.399> get

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so what's cool about that is that we get

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060 
so what's cool about that is that we get
the<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.240> show<00:02:03.479> off<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.049> extreme<00:02:04.530> performance

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the to show off the extreme performance

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.620 
the to show off the extreme performance
that<00:02:05.219> Thunderbolt<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.850> deliver<00:02:06.149> however

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that Thunderbolt can deliver however

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.510 
that Thunderbolt can deliver however
that<00:02:06.840> particular<00:02:07.439> solution<00:02:07.740> isn't

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that particular solution isn't

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
that particular solution isn't
compatible<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> other

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
compatible with some of the other

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
compatible with some of the other
interfaces<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.520> more<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
interfaces so it's going to be more of a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
interfaces so it's going to be more of a
showcase<00:02:12.690> piece<00:02:12.959> than<00:02:13.170> anything

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
showcase piece than anything

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
showcase piece than anything
the<00:02:14.129> benchmarking<00:02:14.670> software<00:02:14.879> we're<00:02:15.239> going<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
the benchmarking software we're going to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.650 
the benchmarking software we're going to
be<00:02:15.540> using<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.500> toe<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> let's<00:02:18.450> talk

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
be using is a toe now let's talk

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.229 
be using is a toe now let's talk
performance<00:02:19.319> at<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.950> low<00:02:20.250> Q<00:02:20.550> depth<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
performance at a low Q depth so this is

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.300 
performance at a low Q depth so this is
your<00:02:21.480> standard<00:02:21.930> copying<00:02:22.470> things<00:02:22.709> around<00:02:22.980> okay

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
your standard copying things around okay

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
your standard copying things around okay
so<00:02:23.610> we're<00:02:23.760> using<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.150> toe<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so we're using a toe and what we see is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
so we're using a toe and what we see is
that<00:02:25.620> SATA<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.879> best<00:02:27.060> okay<00:02:27.540> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that SATA is the best okay that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
that SATA is the best okay that
shouldn't<00:02:28.080> surprise<00:02:28.200> us<00:02:28.560> SATA<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.010> designed

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
shouldn't surprise us SATA is designed

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.619 
shouldn't surprise us SATA is designed
for<00:02:29.849> data<00:02:30.830> storage<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.459> know<00:02:32.610> OS<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.239> lots<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
for data storage you know OS is lots of

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.180 
for data storage you know OS is lots of
little<00:02:33.870> file<00:02:34.140> writes<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.709> totally

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
little file writes it is totally

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.910 
little file writes it is totally
optimized<00:02:35.549> for<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.819> plus<00:02:36.510> SATA<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.530> still

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
optimized for that plus SATA is still

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
optimized for that plus SATA is still
going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.459> bottleneck<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.330> cases

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
going to be the bottleneck in cases

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.119 
going to be the bottleneck in cases
where<00:02:40.080> you're<00:02:40.230> using<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.560> single<00:02:40.890> drive

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
where you're using a single drive

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.220 
where you're using a single drive
because<00:02:41.489> there's<00:02:42.239> still<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> SATA<00:02:42.810> chipset

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
because there's still a SATA chipset

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.690 
because there's still a SATA chipset
inside<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> drive<00:02:43.920> that's<00:02:44.129> being<00:02:44.340> translated

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
inside the drive that's being translated

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
inside the drive that's being translated
to<00:02:45.030> whatever<00:02:45.209> other<00:02:45.630> interface<00:02:46.170> we're<00:02:46.380> using

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to whatever other interface we're using

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.250 
to whatever other interface we're using
so<00:02:47.069> unless<00:02:47.430> you're<00:02:48.000> using<00:02:48.239> thunderbolt<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so unless you're using thunderbolt to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.900 
so unless you're using thunderbolt to
daisy<00:02:49.500> chain<00:02:49.829> drives<00:02:50.099> together<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.730> then

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
daisy chain drives together and then

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.360 
daisy chain drives together and then
raid<00:02:51.120> them<00:02:51.360> for<00:02:51.660> increased<00:02:52.140> performance<00:02:52.380> SATA

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
raid them for increased performance SATA

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.400 
raid them for increased performance SATA
is<00:02:53.730> as<00:02:54.090> good<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.930> get

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
is as good as it can get

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.490 
is as good as it can get
so<00:02:55.980> moving<00:02:56.489> on<00:02:56.610> from<00:02:56.640> there<00:02:57.180> our<00:02:57.810> next<00:02:58.379> best

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
so moving on from there our next best

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
so moving on from there our next best
performer<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.099> actually<00:02:59.459> ua<00:02:59.670> SP<00:03:00.239> which<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
performer is actually ua SP which is a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
kind of an ace thing that they're really

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.059 
kind of an ace thing that they're really

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
for queue depth result we saw a maximum

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.090 
for queue depth result we saw a maximum

we<00:05:56.340> saw<00:05:56.580> about<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.090> same<00:05:57.480> thing<00:05:57.750> so<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:58.020> looks

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
we saw about the same thing so it looks

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.260 
we saw about the same thing so it looks
like<00:05:58.230> about<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.590> 10%<00:05:59.070> reduction<00:05:59.400> for

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
like about a 10% reduction for

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.630 
like about a 10% reduction for
subsequent<00:06:00.960> chains<00:06:01.590> which<00:06:02.190> obviously

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
subsequent chains which obviously

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.210
