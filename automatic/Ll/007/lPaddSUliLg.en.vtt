00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is this photo app that's how I said I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730 
is this photo app that's how I said I
don't<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.530> photo

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
don't know how you say it but the photo

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.910 
don't know how you say it but the photo
app<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:09.750> saw<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
app here is one that I actually saw at a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.910 
app here is one that I actually saw at a
party<00:01:11.729> once<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.360> an<00:01:12.570> event<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.740> actually

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
party once or an event and they actually

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
party once or an event and they actually
had<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> set<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> tripod<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.140> ring

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
had it set up on a tripod and a ring

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
had it set up on a tripod and a ring
light<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.250> ring<00:01:17.939> lights<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.750> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
light so ring lights can be a little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
light so ring lights can be a little
costly<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.009> my<00:01:20.130> budget<00:01:20.310> right

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
costly and that's not in my budget right

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
costly and that's not in my budget right
now<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.600> thought<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.100> could

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
now but I thought that maybe I could

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
now but I thought that maybe I could
show<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.520> guys<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.420> app<00:01:24.659> works<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
show you guys how this app works so I'm

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.060 
show you guys how this app works so I'm
going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> open<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> photo<00:01:27.030> app<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:31.070> when

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
going to open up the photo app and when

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.260 
going to open up the photo app and when
it<00:01:32.159> opens<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:33.710> one<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.829> past<00:01:35.270> this
