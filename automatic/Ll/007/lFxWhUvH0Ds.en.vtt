symptoms is knowing you need to replace
this<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:51.049> getting<00:01:52.049> frost<00:01:52.380> inside<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.130> chute

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
this is getting frost inside the chute

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.679

inside<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> door<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.390> that's<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
inside the door here so that's the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
inside the door here so that's the
inside<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.649> you'll<00:01:58.829> start<00:01:59.130> getting<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.640> ice

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
buildup in here and potentially up in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
buildup in here and potentially up in
this<00:02:03.780> area<00:02:04.049> where<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> ice<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> come

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
this area where the ice is going to come

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
this area where the ice is going to come
down<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> happening<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.530> know

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
down if you get that happening you know

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
down if you get that happening you know
this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> probably<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.459> culprit<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.360> fairly

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
this is probably the culprit it's fairly

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.770 
this is probably the culprit it's fairly
cheap<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> Lowe's<00:02:11.670> they've<00:02:12.540> got

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
cheap if you go to Lowe's they've got

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
cheap if you go to Lowe's they've got
the<00:02:12.959> number<00:02:13.260> two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the number two

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.520 
the number two
order<00:02:13.799> these<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.569> don't<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:15.959> exactly<00:02:16.110> for

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
order these so I don't know exactly for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.080 
order these so I don't know exactly for
your<00:02:16.620> area<00:02:17.010> which<00:02:17.250> will<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> right<00:02:17.909> place

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
your area which will be the right place

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.750 
your area which will be the right place
for<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.799> but<00:02:19.799> when<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.310> wife<00:02:20.519> go

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
for you to go but when I have my wife go

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
for you to go but when I have my wife go
up<00:02:20.849> there<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.690> their<00:02:21.840> hand

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
up there and do what their hand

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
up there and do what their hand
it<00:02:22.440> was<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.680> inconvenient<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:26.239> going<00:02:27.239> in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
it was very inconvenient this going in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.000 
it was very inconvenient this going in
this<00:02:27.540> direction<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.319> actually<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> phone

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this direction I can actually do a phone

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.509 
this direction I can actually do a phone
hand<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:32.069> there<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.640> because

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
hand so you can see in there is because

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.699 
hand so you can see in there is because
there's<00:02:35.519> these<00:02:35.640> little<00:02:36.200> brackets<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
there's these little brackets here that

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.199 
there's these little brackets here that
you<00:02:37.799> got<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> put<00:02:38.129> on<00:02:38.159> there<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.579> then<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.849> is

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
you got to put on there and then this is

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.180 
you got to put on there and then this is
you<00:02:39.329> get<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> hook<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.900> I'm<00:02:40.560> trying<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.040> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
you get a hook in I'm trying to do it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.339 
you get a hook in I'm trying to do it
with<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.430> door<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.239> panel<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:42.810> is

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
with this door and this panel on is

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.759 
with this door and this panel on is
almost<00:02:43.860> impossible<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.560> once<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:48.769> that

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
almost impossible but once you have that

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.330 
almost impossible but once you have that
off<00:02:50.040> all<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> do<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:51.680> slide<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.599> bar

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
off all you do is slide it on that bar

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.500 
off all you do is slide it on that bar
and<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:58.099> once<00:02:59.099> you're<00:02:59.220> done<00:02:59.250> yeah<00:02:59.510> okay

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and then once you're done yeah okay

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.890 
and then once you're done yeah okay
that's<00:03:01.260> how<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.440> replace<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.950> thing<00:03:02.159> now

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
that's how you replace that thing now

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.750 
that's how you replace that thing now
like<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.989> said<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:04.950> afraid<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.430> take<00:03:05.549> this

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
like I said I was afraid to take this

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.390 
like I said I was afraid to take this
off<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.810> shouldn't<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.290> been<00:03:07.409> because

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
off but I shouldn't have been because

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.089 
off but I shouldn't have been because
all<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:11.040> part<00:03:14.060> Vigilant<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.470> this

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
all it is this part Vigilant one so this

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.900 
all it is this part Vigilant one so this
part<00:03:17.400> moves<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.569> here<00:03:18.950> all<00:03:19.950> right<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.760> can

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
part moves in here all right so you can

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.400 
part moves in here all right so you can
see<00:03:21.030> there's<00:03:21.209> four<00:03:21.450> screws<00:03:22.069> here<00:03:24.950> here<00:03:27.410> here

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
see there's four screws here here here

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.920 
see there's four screws here here here
and<00:03:28.709> down<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.489> once<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.389> put<00:03:30.569> those<00:03:30.660> four

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and down here once you put those four

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.599 
and down here once you put those four
screws<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.410> there<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:33.139> channel<00:03:34.430> steeps<00:03:35.430> in

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
screws on there this channel steeps in

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.589 
screws on there this channel steeps in
here<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.030> comes<00:03:36.389> up<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.040> then<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:39.109> this

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
here and comes up and then you just this

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.939 
here and comes up and then you just this
the<00:03:42.599> molding<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.109> just<00:03:43.290> push<00:03:43.440> back<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.799> there

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
the molding you just push back in there

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.030 
the molding you just push back in there
so<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> pause<00:03:45.510> real<00:03:45.870> quick<00:03:45.900> put<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.829> back

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
so what a pause real quick put this back

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.580 
so what a pause real quick put this back
on<00:03:47.250> there<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.549> show<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.139> actually<00:03:49.139> let's<00:03:49.440> not

on there and show you actually let's not
do<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.129> way<00:03:50.389> trust<00:03:51.389> me<00:03:51.540> four<00:03:51.959> screws

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
do that that way trust me four screws

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.990 
do that that way trust me four screws
pop<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:52.829> there<00:03:52.980> if<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.609> were<00:03:53.760> smart

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
pop that in there if you were smart

enough to get it off you can get it back

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.680 
enough to get it off you can get it back
on<00:03:55.440> there<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:56.669> other<00:03:56.790> part<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.150> video<00:03:57.269> is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
on there the other part of the video is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.199 
on there the other part of the video is
the<00:03:58.500> water<00:03:59.010> line<00:03:59.220> right<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.699> the<00:03:59.790> water<00:03:59.970> line

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the water line right so the water line

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.119 
the water line right so the water line
was<00:04:00.329> freezing<00:04:00.629> we<00:04:01.290> left<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.769> couple<00:04:01.889> days

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
was freezing we left for a couple days

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.050 
was freezing we left for a couple days
and<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> decided<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.849> turn<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.239> freezer<00:04:03.989> up<00:04:04.290> a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
and I decided to turn the freezer up a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.550 
and I decided to turn the freezer up a
few<00:04:06.060> degrees<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:06.419> or<00:04:06.959> down<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.169> few<00:04:07.440> degrees

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
few degrees just or down a few degrees

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.869 
few degrees just or down a few degrees
just<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.010> make<00:04:08.160> sure<00:04:08.190> everything<00:04:08.549> was<00:04:08.669> stayed

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
just to make sure everything was stayed

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.110 
just to make sure everything was stayed
good<00:04:09.120> while<00:04:09.359> we're<00:04:09.510> going<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:11.669> froze<00:04:11.910> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
good while we're going and it froze the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.050 
good while we're going and it froze the
line<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.280> was<00:04:14.280> trying<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.579> investigate

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
line so I was trying to investigate

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.699 
line so I was trying to investigate
where<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.540> water<00:04:15.720> line<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:15.959> coming<00:04:16.260> into<00:04:16.530> this

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
where the water line is coming into this

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.830 
where the water line is coming into this
door<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.459> right<00:04:17.639> here<00:04:17.940> alright<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.479> this

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
door and it's right here alright so this

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.610

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
frozen inside your door so I just put

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.880 
frozen inside your door so I just put
that<00:05:04.510> back<00:05:04.780> on<00:05:04.810> one<00:05:05.170> handed<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.680> can<00:05:05.770> see

that back on one handed so you can see
how<00:05:06.010> easy<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.850> replace<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.560> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
how easy it is to replace it so the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.160 
how easy it is to replace it so the

water line goes up goes up your door and
up<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.590> dispenser<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:18.120> if<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.330> gets

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
up to the dispenser and if it gets

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.780 
up to the dispenser and if it gets
frozen<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:20.650> won't<00:05:20.830> get<00:05:20.980> water<00:05:21.100> out<00:05:21.430> you'll

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
frozen you won't get water out you'll

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.490 
frozen you won't get water out you'll
hear<00:05:21.940> some<00:05:21.970> clicking<00:05:22.480> noises<00:05:22.690> what<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.230> water

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
hear some clicking noises what the water

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.520 
hear some clicking noises what the water
won't<00:05:23.710> come<00:05:23.950> out<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:25.210> what<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.020> need<00:05:26.140> to<00:05:26.200> do<00:05:26.380> is

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
won't come out so what you need to do is

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.070 
won't come out so what you need to do is
turn<00:05:26.710> make<00:05:26.980> your<00:05:27.160> your<00:05:27.790> temperature<00:05:28.630> warmer

throughout your entire system and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.020 
throughout your entire system and
eventually<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:32.470> ice<00:05:32.650> will<00:05:33.520> just<00:05:33.700> come<00:05:33.850> right

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
eventually the ice will just come right

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.820 
eventually the ice will just come right
out<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.360> line<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:35.200> you<00:05:35.230> just<00:05:35.500> have<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.680> keep

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
out of the line so you just have to keep

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.250 
out of the line so you just have to keep
trying<00:05:36.160> over<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.430> day<00:05:36.640> or<00:05:36.760> two<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.260> generally

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
trying over a day or two and generally

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.870 
trying over a day or two and generally
it<00:05:38.410> will<00:05:38.530> come<00:05:38.770> back<00:05:38.860> on<00:05:39.070> there's<00:05:39.340> some<00:05:39.520> forms

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880

heat up the door and free up the ice you
can<00:05:47.650> do<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:47.980> it<00:05:48.760> took<00:05:48.970> me<00:05:49.150> two<00:05:49.300> days<00:05:49.330> for<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
can do that it took me two days for the

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.350 
can do that it took me two days for the
water<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.460> unfreeze<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:53.250> my<00:05:54.250> frigerator<00:05:55.090> is

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
water to unfreeze and my frigerator is

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.550 
water to unfreeze and my frigerator is
now<00:05:55.600> fully<00:05:56.140> operational<00:05:56.260> so<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.660> the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
now fully operational so that is the

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.380 
now fully operational so that is the
