thing back out real quick and that's it
and<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.640> does<00:02:03.820> go<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> lot<00:02:04.270> louder<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:05.680> would

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and it does go a lot louder then would

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.540 
and it does go a lot louder then would

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
if I loosen this one here this will rise

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.480 
if I loosen this one here this will rise
up<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.670> down<00:02:25.080> where<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.380> pivot<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.800> then<00:02:27.340> if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
up and down where I can pivot it then if

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.830 
up and down where I can pivot it then if
I<00:02:27.610> loosen<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.660> screw<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.209> can

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I loosen this screw right here I can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.240 
I loosen this screw right here I can
make<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.200> tilt<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.470> once<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.100> get

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
make it tilt up and down so once you get

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.860 
make it tilt up and down so once you get
it<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> position<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.360> want<00:02:37.390> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it in the position that you want you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.479 
it in the position that you want you
just<00:02:38.110> leave<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.470> at<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.739> position<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
just leave it at that position and

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.440 
just leave it at that position and
you're<00:02:39.880> good<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.239> go

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
you're good to go

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
you're good to go
it<00:02:40.900> doesn't<00:02:41.260> look<00:02:41.410> too<00:02:41.560> bad<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:42.310> sitting

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it doesn't look too bad just sitting

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.199 
it doesn't look too bad just sitting
there<00:02:42.700> by<00:02:42.940> itself<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.700> said<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.090> can

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
there by itself and like I said you can

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.729 
there by itself and like I said you can
see<00:02:46.360> how<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.660> one<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.989> little<00:02:47.170> different

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
see how this one is a little different

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.790 
see how this one is a little different
it's<00:02:48.040> got<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.430> line<00:02:48.760> right<00:02:49.209> here<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.590> will

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
it's got that line right here this will

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.740 
it's got that line right here this will
pretty<00:02:51.070> much<00:02:51.190> open<00:02:51.880> right<00:02:52.120> up<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.450> fit<00:02:52.720> right

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
pretty much open right up and fit right

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.140 
pretty much open right up and fit right
over<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.350> handlebar<00:02:53.830> put<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> screw<00:02:54.670> back<00:02:54.700> in

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
over the handlebar put the screw back in

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.080 
over the handlebar put the screw back in
there<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.350> thing<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.980> what<00:02:57.430> where

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
there but the thing is is what where

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.650 
there but the thing is is what where
that<00:02:58.299> screw<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.380> where<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.390> you're

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
that screw is is where this is so you're

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.660 
that screw is is where this is so you're
gonna<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.110> find<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.440> screw<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.310> fits

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
gonna have to find a screw that fits

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.759 
gonna have to find a screw that fits
into<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.450> screw<00:03:04.900> that's<00:03:05.049> behind<00:03:05.500> there

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
into the screw that's behind there

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.140 
into the screw that's behind there
you'll<00:03:06.040> see<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.430> once<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.760> take<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.060> off

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you'll see it once you take it off

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.930 
you'll see it once you take it off
you'll<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.510> what<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.720> mean<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:09.610> pretty

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
you'll know what I mean so that's pretty

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.479 
you'll know what I mean so that's pretty
much<00:03:10.120> all<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.709> I'm<00:03:12.100> gonna<00:03:12.220> put

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.890 

now<00:03:19.020> as<00:03:19.170> far<00:03:19.380> as<00:03:20.270> hearing<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.390> down<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.720> road

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
now as far as hearing it down the road

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.870 
now as far as hearing it down the road
you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.530> probably<00:03:22.980> your<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.490> concerns

you know probably your little concerns
on<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.620> 30<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.920> 35<00:03:26.460> miles<00:03:26.790> an<00:03:27.090> hour<00:03:27.240> once<00:03:27.510> you

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
on that 30 to 35 miles an hour once you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.250 
on that 30 to 35 miles an hour once you
get<00:03:27.840> past<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.230> 35<00:03:28.860> mile<00:03:29.130> an<00:03:29.160> hour<00:03:29.430> mark<00:03:30.260> it's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
get past that 35 mile an hour mark it's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.450 
get past that 35 mile an hour mark it's
when<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.620> becomes<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.070> little<00:03:32.220> bit<00:03:32.340> difficult

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
when it becomes a little bit difficult

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.690 
when it becomes a little bit difficult
to<00:03:33.090> hear<00:03:33.500> but<00:03:34.500> again<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> don't<00:03:35.370> have<00:03:35.580> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
to hear but again I don't have a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.880 
to hear but again I don't have a
windshield<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.480> nothing<00:03:37.020> blocking<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> sound

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
windshield so nothing blocking the sound

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.190 
windshield so nothing blocking the sound
so<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> assume<00:03:38.880> if<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.150> ever<00:03:39.360> get<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> windshield

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
so I assume if I ever get a windshield

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.880 
so I assume if I ever get a windshield
I'll<00:03:40.560> be<00:03:40.710> able<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:41.010> hear<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.340> past<00:03:41.600> 35<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:43.560> I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
I'll be able to hear it past 35 but I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.920 
I'll be able to hear it past 35 but I
