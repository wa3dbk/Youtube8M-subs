00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 Agricultural simulator 2013 mod 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.910
 imagination we should watch a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.820
 really fast tugs 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.040
 namely the jcw fast track this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.369
 Types of construction is known for being them 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.060
 I think very fast and 70 km h 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.510
 are about real and here's one 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.550
 relatively large representative of the seven 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 seven thousand series yes now as 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.920
 mother appeared and I have to all 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.260
 I love it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 but I will just before in the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.790
 shop rhine and then we want 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.989
 that's what we are looking at 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.950
 values ​​that we have so offers 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.140
 1.4 liter engine six cylinder up 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.239
 2100 revolutions turned up and scarce 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 That's about 300 ps 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.579
 pretty neat so big 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 Tug with a continuously variable transmission 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.649
 and ten tons of hydraulics for that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.530
 not really nice that this is all 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.110
 exactly the ten tons were listed 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.640
 that is actually already 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 he definitely counts for it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.950
 the larger tractors yes wait now 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 I have here I wanted to be exactly 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.060
 the number show 8310 is 310 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.759
 I think lets close to the ps 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.799
 and 8000 there is the series so far 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.000
 I know 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.700
 Nevertheless, I can also open there 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 you can already see everything clean so far 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.329
 does not look like we were in there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 the problems worked very clean 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.299
 I still have to be the textures 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 I like it really well 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.890
 partly here a bit cooler 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.780
 april has that one can already 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 straight distance you can not do that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.210
 let it go right 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 really good forwards here this the yes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.490
 the bull's finger where the lights are in it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.049
 I really like hanging out 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 just like rim tires that's all 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.189
 can definitely go there because of that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.899
 whole is clamped or that this 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.799
 Tug is actually something to do 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.450
 was made and big 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.219
 to report transport work 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.239
 That's why I'm here right now 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.210
 times a 60 ton kröger one cabbage 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.070
 kippa hung on it 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.570
 and I'll just enter now time 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.240
 so we can of course also the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.510
 open the door so then you have ever 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890
 easily the sound I change 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.450
 cockpit back I'm a little cold 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.250
 I like to be here a bit today 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.380
 I would like to have it myself the ic 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 we can use the control 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.950
 to open and close doors as you are here 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 looks quite beautiful on time error 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 but not noticed I thought there 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 the frame here would not be that real 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.200
 fits exactly that looks pretty good 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.120
 I have to say that with the murder of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 I liked it very much over 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 a year ago jcb and the sounds 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.450
 extremely packed suspension and there must 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 I am directly attached to driving behavior 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 is really really good and stable 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 they will not live again later 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.590
 We are here in the middle of the day 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.880
 That's not the attitude here 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.100
 we can change the speed of 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.840
 miles on course , the infobox does 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.360
 the helpers box so we can stop the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.870
 speed vary between km h 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 as you see above and miles do not net 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.760
 do not know if that is so necessary now 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.780
 I do not think we can back up 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.180
 in any case, the rear window 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.080
 what am I doing a bit yes me 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.100
 do not know if that's his 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.010
 Tug definitely needs cool 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.510
 that was installed 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.470
 otherwise pay attention to the pedals 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.030
 move that's nice 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.950
 that jcb i do not know exactly how they do 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.920
 hot command control or something 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.520
 depending on the manufacturer john deere twinstar 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.430
 etc keeps this infotainment system or 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.630
 Anyway, that's pretty chic too 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.550
 actually made if you do it too 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.830
 can put and brake and so on 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.510
 further, I am also wonderful 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.570
 little is missing who his sitting position 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.740
 conception as it partly exists find 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.680
 I like this position a bit 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.770
 funny but well I think that fits 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770
 beautiful 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.379
 with light that the steering wheel and so on 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:14.299
 continue the one with springs one now like that 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.729
 Look here is right before left euro 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.239
 Nevertheless, it stays good 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.680
 sometimes in wk ii something 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.880
 we make strange as a whole 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.770
 not have that looks right 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.180
 really chic from actually that can 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.280
 you do not sell it all around 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.240
 I would say what else can you do 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.699
 still to do so 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.650
 We have to touch the buttons we have 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.870
 here are still different 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.639
 Worklight and that 's it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.139
 actually so on the whole 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.599
 Now I just want to enter 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.580
 drive a bit and then a bit 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.630
 judge how the whole thing so from 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.060
 feels like driving 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.800
 Oh, I almost forgot eight times 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.440
 behind the trailer hitch the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.550
 we can with m and came up and 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.710
 slide down that's pretty handy 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.479
 if you had different cars 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 I believe turntable belongs to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.800
 for it and yes it definitely 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.840
 useful is that the inclusive included 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.330
 I say and I actually like 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.849
 also pretty good so now i will 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.760
 of course the speed indicator 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:19.000
 By the way, your middle is moment on 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:21.289
 miles i think hello try it 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.940
 somehow it just comes to me 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.620
 a little bit flawed 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.810
 I just did not know exactly 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.130
 what I did differently on everyone 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.990
 she has already had a fall 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.090
 I would insert the tempomat two 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.550
 he has just the lever but the 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.840
 cruise control is even there limiter here 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.229
 I like that about it 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:44.530
 pretty good 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.530
 yes this is definitely a cool gadget 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.100
 her in four that worked where with km / h 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.890
 I do not know why it is not so 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.540
 But now we want to have it again 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.560
 we are back in sync what is there in the display 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.900
 stands and what the normal display 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.010
 say so i will do it again 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.860
 properly gas 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.770
 you can already think that way 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.960
 a tug to 90 percent to drive off 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.190
 and so on is used there is the 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.740
 speed of course right 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.030
 really important and here with the big one 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.610
 trailer had a few problems 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.660
 so we can easily reach 60 us 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.120
 will also be a little faster 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.770
 Anyway, that was before 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.930
 at my test already clearly 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.120
 better we just have to do it a bit 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.530
 let it accelerate for longer and then 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.150
 namely, scratching is also problematic here 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.930
 actually the 70 if you always right 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.930
 let fly 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.620
 then we are here again 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.910
 at the town hall the town hall is with us 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.650
 one of my favorite buildings on the 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.670
 respect I'll just go back now 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.510
 disconnect the device and sometimes without 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.830
 drive trailer 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.960
 the acceleration will be the same 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.280
 Much better and here you can see 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.620
 also that the curves really with 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.610
 can drive at an extremely high speed 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.950
 even if I'm just a bit here 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.420
 Malheur but makes the suspension so far 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.310
 we had only 70 on the speedometer 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.960
 stand that is really right 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.890
 beautiful 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.690
 the suspension behaves but 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.010
 actually pretty good behavior too 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.650
 at this high speed is 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.900
 really enormously good acts now and then 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.820
 bit sluggish but at least yes 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.760
 but not so extremely erratic 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.350
 So one has little feeling that the 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.270
 is tug water and he does so 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.200
 also and that's why I like the whole thing 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.740
 actually pretty good 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.330
 the vote of the driving behavior here yes 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.980
 I really wanted you this jcb 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.290
 show because I have so I have something 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.970
 I missed one of those before 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.300
 I think even 75 or 80 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.860
 the whole was simply miserable by 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.720
 driving behavior yes and this is here 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.890
 really what the song was me 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.880
 maybe one or the other 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.320
 I will use other displays 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.620
 not great at jobs today do not know either 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.400
 Somehow I have a gasp breathing today 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.400
 we will see each other in any case
