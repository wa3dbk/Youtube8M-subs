00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
the time change of wheels then more

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.569 
the time change of wheels then more
horsepower<00:00:56.390> change<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.320> seats<00:00:57.649> another

these guards are actually still garden
underneath<00:03:19.130> which<00:03:19.310> has<00:03:19.459> been<00:03:19.580> chopped<00:03:19.819> to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
underneath which has been chopped to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.600 
underneath which has been chopped to
pieces<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:21.170> basically<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.800> made<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.400> bit

pieces<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.860> aluminium<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:26.060> filled<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.990> with

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
pieces of aluminium and filled it with

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.540 
pieces of aluminium and filled it with
foam<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.740> then<00:03:27.920> from<00:03:28.100> there<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.459> know

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
foam and then from there you know

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.210 
foam and then from there you know
fiberglass<00:03:29.150> at<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.450> top<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.860> just<00:03:31.040> gotta

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
fiberglass at the top and you just gotta

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.330 
fiberglass at the top and you just gotta
kind<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.690> work<00:03:32.690> out<00:03:32.870> how<00:03:33.050> it<00:03:33.080> works<00:03:33.290> or<00:03:33.530> find<00:03:34.280> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
kind of work out how it works or find a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.490 
kind of work out how it works or find a
friend<00:03:34.610> in<00:03:35.420> building<00:03:35.720> those<00:03:35.870> two<00:03:36.110> guards

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
friend in building those two guards

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.800 
friend in building those two guards

you<00:03:44.060> know<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.510> obviously<00:03:44.780> having<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.260> wind

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
you know and obviously having a wind

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.100 
you know and obviously having a wind
tunnel<00:03:45.590> would<00:03:45.860> be<00:03:46.040> fantastic<00:03:46.430> though<00:03:47.360> no

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
tunnel would be fantastic though no

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
you know the way things are designed on

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.350 
you know the way things are designed on
other<00:03:55.010> cars<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.580> that's<00:03:55.880> we're<00:03:56.060> getting<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.300> lot

so<00:04:27.970> that's<00:04:28.090> just<00:04:28.240> another<00:04:28.389> one<00:04:28.599> of<00:04:28.690> those<00:04:28.750> days

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
so that's just another one of those days

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.110 
so that's just another one of those days
we<00:04:29.199> just<00:04:29.229> fixed<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.159> car<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.819> know<00:04:30.879> again

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
we just fixed the car and you know again

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.179 
we just fixed the car and you know again
next<00:04:31.270> time

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.010 

I<00:04:36.219> mean<00:04:36.939> to<00:04:37.029> rebuild<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.509> now<00:04:37.659> you'd<00:04:37.989> probably

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
I mean to rebuild it now you'd probably

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.239 
I mean to rebuild it now you'd probably
get<00:04:38.699> some<00:04:39.699> change<00:04:39.939> out<00:04:40.209> of<00:04:40.300> 100,000<00:04:41.249> maybe

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:42.249 
get some change out of 100,000 maybe

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.710 
get some change out of 100,000 maybe
enough<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.699> Barbie<00:04:43.029> but<00:04:43.509> some<00:04:44.499> change

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.960 

I<00:04:47.750> never<00:04:48.440> even<00:04:48.650> dreamed<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.130> I'd<00:04:49.280> be<00:04:49.430> doing

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
I never even dreamed that I'd be doing

00:04:49.970 --> 00:05:01.930 
I never even dreamed that I'd be doing
it<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.330> attack<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:52.370> come<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.730> and<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.210> buzzer

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.760 

I<00:05:01.970> mean<00:05:02.720> that's<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.020> guess<00:05:03.230> what<00:05:03.410> keeps<00:05:03.650> me

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
I mean that's I guess what keeps me

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:12.310 
I mean that's I guess what keeps me
coming<00:05:03.800> back<00:05:04.100> you<00:05:04.970> know<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.300> then<00:05:05.390> ricey

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.810 

there's<00:05:12.770> not<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.040> better<00:05:13.220> feeling<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.760> the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
there's not a better feeling in the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.670 
there's not a better feeling in the
world<00:05:13.910> than<00:05:14.270> getting<00:05:14.570> out<00:05:14.690> there<00:05:14.930> just<00:05:15.500> doing

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
world than getting out there just doing

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.150 
world than getting out there just doing
it<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:16.040> know

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.220 

you
