this would be interesting and helpful to
people<00:00:36.100> out<00:00:36.519> there<00:00:36.760> who<00:00:37.120> may<00:00:37.780> be<00:00:37.839> ordering

i<00:01:00.040> would<00:01:00.489> definitely<00:01:00.790> call<00:01:01.089> this<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.299> single

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570

i would definitely call this a single
serving<00:01:02.049> size<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:03.330> 180<00:01:04.330> milliliters<00:01:04.900> is<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
serving size and 180 milliliters is the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.149 
serving size and 180 milliliters is the
smallest<00:01:07.200> individual<00:01:08.200> bottle<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.740> i've

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
smallest individual bottle that i've

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.300 
smallest individual bottle that i've
seen<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.500> see<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:11.860> one<00:01:12.130> 80

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
seen so if you see this one 80

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.740 
seen so if you see this one 80
milliliters<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:13.090> know<00:01:13.240> you're<00:01:13.450> getting

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
milliliters you know you're getting

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.719 
milliliters you know you're getting
pretty<00:01:14.290> small<00:01:14.710> amount<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.100> socket<00:01:15.490> for<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
pretty small amount of socket for the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.240 
pretty small amount of socket for the
money<00:01:15.909> so<00:01:16.030> just<00:01:16.180> be<00:01:16.450> aware<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
money so just be aware of that and it's

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.740 
money so just be aware of that and it's
definitely<00:01:18.549> good<00:01:18.970> if<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.329> want<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.570> try

definitely good if you want to try

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.929 
definitely good if you want to try
something<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.890> could<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.549> tasting

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
something this could be like a tasting

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.590 
something this could be like a tasting
size<00:01:22.180> almost<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:23.830> it's<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.430> really<00:01:24.909> you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
size almost but it's it's a really you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.080 
size almost but it's it's a really you
know<00:01:25.720> interesting<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.500> see<00:01:26.680> 180<00:01:27.520> versus<00:01:27.970> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
know interesting to see 180 versus the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.870 
know interesting to see 180 versus the
other<00:01:28.120> sizes<00:01:28.480> so<00:01:28.870> this<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> smallest<00:01:30.100> 180

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
other sizes so this is the smallest 180

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.360 
other sizes so this is the smallest 180
milliliters<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.650> next<00:01:32.650> size<00:01:32.800> up<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.130> much

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
milliliters the next size up is much

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.690 
milliliters the next size up is much
much<00:01:33.580> more<00:01:33.790> common<00:01:34.300> it's<00:01:34.890> 300<00:01:35.890> milliliters

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
much more common it's 300 milliliters

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.200 
much more common it's 300 milliliters
and<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:37.690> often<00:01:38.380> see<00:01:38.830> this<00:01:39.010> size<00:01:39.250> his<00:01:39.790> bottle

getting full bottle size there is one
more<00:03:36.470> size<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.890> though<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.940> 1.8

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
more size up though and that is 1.8

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.380 
more size up though and that is 1.8
liters<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.010> really<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.670> shy<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.180> two

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
liters that is really just shy of a two

liters that is really just shy of a two
liter<00:03:41.600> bottle<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:42.170> soda<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:42.920> can

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
liter bottle of soda so as you can

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.340 
liter bottle of soda so as you can
imagine<00:03:43.100> it's<00:03:43.970> quite<00:03:44.120> large<00:03:44.570> let's<00:03:45.110> take<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
imagine it's quite large let's take a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.070 
imagine it's quite large let's take a
look<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> same<00:03:47.360> sake<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.810> just

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
look so this is the same sake I just

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.690 
look so this is the same sake I just
showed<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.290> but<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.800> larger<00:03:49.160> bottle<00:03:49.489> size

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
showed you but in the larger bottle size

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.930 
showed you but in the larger bottle size
and<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.600> kind<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.220> economy<00:03:52.220> costco

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
and this is kind of the economy costco

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.960 
and this is kind of the economy costco
size<00:03:53.180> I'd<00:03:53.420> say<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:54.010> most<00:03:55.010> often<00:03:55.190> see<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.700> type

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
size I'd say I most often see this type

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.479 
size I'd say I most often see this type
