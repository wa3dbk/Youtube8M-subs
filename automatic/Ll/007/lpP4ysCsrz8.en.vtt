00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.840
 hello we respect visitor buyers 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.020
 store season 7 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.779
 Today we will have a small video on 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:20.960
 about such a timer for water with us 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.640
 there is a great video on 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.230
 With the review of such a timer now will be 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.819
 link by which it will be possible 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.860
 look here so what are these two 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:37.579
 the timer is different visually they 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.680
 absolutely identical different 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.480
 manufacturers 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:49.519
 but the difference in them actually is 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:51.969
 the differences are pretty serious nowhere in 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.269
 descriptions even in the instructions 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.070
 the manufacturer does not indicate this 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.129
 you need to be very careful when 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.140
 acquisition so really 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.540
 serious difference 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.520
 you can only see it 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.310
 more precisely you can just look here 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.310
 here here we see the ball mechanism 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:22.430
 here but such a mechanism is not visible if 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.770
 including this timer we hear the sound and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.590
 see pivot turning 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.890
 opening balls mechanism here we are 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.690
 hear just click here not mistaken 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.960
 here solenoid type types worth 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.190
 valve what does this mean for us on 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 practice practice this means that 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.620
 this ball timer will be 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.390
 work at the very words of water pressure 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.960
 with gravity systems such as 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 drip irrigation if we stand there 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.780
 a barrel some kind of the same valve will 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.140
 work only with appreciable pressure 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.390
 water 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.230
 just yesterday, we specifically went to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.990
 Dacha checked costs a large capacity 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.240
 put on again short meters above the ground 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:22.460
 that is, a set of it goes 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.720
 have the weakest but timer water 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.050
 no cameras open but no water comes out 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.590
 if you connect connect pressure 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.840
 already 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 for example from the crane from the trunk 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 If the timer is running water at least for a start 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.960
 so far about our tagged the nicest but 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.550
 still he has a timer too 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:50.990
 work out so again I draw 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.370
 attention is the main difference in what 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:59.480
 Valve type ball valve works with 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.530
 any pressure such valve and we don't 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.900
 see the ball only works with tangible 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.940
 water pressure 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.010
 again unfortunately no data 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.730
 Flint to the manufacturer not at the supplier 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.660
 there is no reason to even turn 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.570
 note that the instructions are labeled as such 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 the connector that comes bundled does not go to 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.320
 photos have a connector this is needed for 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:33.910
 in order to plug in water 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.910
 this type of connection is universal 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:41.690
 study can also be used for 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.810
 both valves i will be timers can 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.230
 take advantage of this 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.330
 Universal there are Christmas trees which 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.180
 allow for different different diameter 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.530
 hose connect about 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.570
 universal connectors we have 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.280
 great video you can watch on our 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.740
 site 8 season dot ru 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.350
 in the irrigation and irrigation section there 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.420
 great video which tells what 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.350
 it's like using it 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.570
 how convenient and cool thing is 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.040
 choose to do well thought out 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.520
 the choice 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.520
 further purchases
