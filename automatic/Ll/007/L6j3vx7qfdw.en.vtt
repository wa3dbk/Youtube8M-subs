00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
atomic mass comm here today we have the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
atomic mass comm here today we have the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
Kyosho real light decoration system this

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.290 
Kyosho real light decoration system this
system<00:00:10.250> really<00:00:11.250> sets<00:00:11.550> itself<00:00:11.790> apart<00:00:11.969> from

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
system really sets itself apart from

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640 
system really sets itself apart from
anything<00:00:12.509> else<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.990> there<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.200> mini<00:00:13.440> Z's

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
anything else out there for mini Z's

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
anything else out there for mini Z's
right<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.450> really<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
right now I think it's it's really a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.750 
right now I think it's it's really a
smart<00:00:16.170> system<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:17.310> knows<00:00:17.490> when<00:00:17.640> you're

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
smart system it knows when you're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
smart system it knows when you're
accelerating<00:00:18.330> decelerating<00:00:18.600> braking<00:00:19.470> as<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
accelerating decelerating braking as you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
accelerating decelerating braking as you
can<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.340> got<00:00:20.490> brake<00:00:20.699> lights<00:00:20.939> had<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
can see it's got brake lights had the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.590 
can see it's got brake lights had the
flashing<00:00:22.170> headlights<00:00:22.789> it's<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> ever<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
flashing headlights it's got the ever so

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.710 
flashing headlights it's got the ever so
cool<00:00:25.880> backfiring<00:00:26.880> tailpipes

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
cool backfiring tailpipes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.259 
cool backfiring tailpipes
which<00:00:28.019> i<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.619> neat<00:00:28.830> addition

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
which i think is a really neat addition

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.490 
which i think is a really neat addition
you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> hazards<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you can see the hazards there when you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
you can see the hazards there when you
leave<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> car<00:00:31.920> idle<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> few<00:00:32.579> seconds<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
leave the car idle for a few seconds the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.190 
leave the car idle for a few seconds the
hazards<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.570> come<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
hazards actually come on and when you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.569 
hazards actually come on and when you
start<00:00:34.440> rolling<00:00:34.649> again<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.950> turn<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
start rolling again they turn off as you

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
start rolling again they turn off as you
just<00:00:35.730> saw<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> actually<00:00:37.890> Frank
