00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
definitely wasn't something that was

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.520 
definitely wasn't something that was
thought<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.570> okay<00:00:33.570> suppose<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.320> just

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
thought out okay suppose that was just

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.950 
thought out okay suppose that was just
the<00:00:35.399> song<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.030> did<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> bunch<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> songs<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the song we did a bunch of songs and I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
the song we did a bunch of songs and I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
thought that that was the strongest is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
thought that that was the strongest is
that<00:00:38.879> indicative<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> expect

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that indicative of what we can expect

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650 
that indicative of what we can expect
from<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> upcoming<00:00:41.640> album<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.540> what

it's<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.360> expensive<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.530> not

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it's going to be expensive it's not

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's going to be expensive it's not
funny

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
funny

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.389 
funny
and<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.740> something<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and it's not it's not something that is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
and it's not it's not something that is
a<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:53.939> book<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.570> play<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.869> jokes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
a good book just like play on jokes

a good book just like play on jokes
yeah<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.040> maybe<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.790> maybe

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
yeah I think maybe that was so maybe

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510 
yeah I think maybe that was so maybe
consideration<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.869> true<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
consideration it's true yeah is this a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.450 
consideration it's true yeah is this a
good<00:01:59.700> idea<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.840> stupid<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:02.310> they

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
good idea to be stupid I think when they

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.270 
good idea to be stupid I think when they
said<00:02:03.020> give<00:02:04.020> us<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> list<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.560> places<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.979> play<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
