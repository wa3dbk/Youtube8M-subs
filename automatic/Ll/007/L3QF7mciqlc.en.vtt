00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.330
 this new video finally today there 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 show how to jailbreak 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.609
 i untethered 7.0 point 50 5 e 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 iphone 5 c you remember that video that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.650
 I did a few days ago where you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 I recommended not to upgrade to ios 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:32.579
 7.0.517.41 and a few days later today 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.559
 we have confirmation that the exploits do not 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.960
 then the jailbreak was closed and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 it remains valid however since the team 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.540
 of development of rage that is not going to him 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 have still updated ideas jones 7 in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:55.949
 official way therefore does not support 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 still aires 7.0.517.41 and I created it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.090
 for windows and for mac I will leave you the link 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.750
 in description then if you want to run 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 ios untethered jailbreak 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 7.0.517.41 I will resign the new link in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 this description as you see me 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:30.360
 I'm on aires 7.0.517.41 but vi 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.049
 I recommend going to settings 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 general block with code or if 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.930
 you have a iphone 5 sieve and and code 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.210
 and disable any type of code 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.909
 I highly recommend the lockscreen 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.100
 important not to have a password 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 lockscreen and must be free and not 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.240
 you will need to have no code after that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 you will have finished the jailbreak you can 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.250
 re-enable it but you won't have to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 absolutely have it also too 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.469
 recommended to go to the automatic block 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.540
 and set it to never once set 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.729
 these two parameters in the settings 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.099
 a very last precaution before 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.590
 perform jailbreak or execute a 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.920
 full backup of your iphone for 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 to do it just open itunes 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 on your computer and go to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.849
 select your iphone e 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.580
 then below click on 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.110
 backup now so that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.819
 if something should go wrong 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.560
 during the procedure 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.270
 just do a restore e 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.340
 then reinstall the backup 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.500
 therefore your data will be safe 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.170
 once backed up you can open 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.140
 evasion 7 if it gives you problems with 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.450
 the opening will suffice if you are on mac doing 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.700
 right click and select open 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.140
 while if you are on windows 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.380
 right click and select 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.690
 run as administrator and veil will open 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.209
 without problems once opened like 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.600
 you see recognize my iphone 5s with 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.030
 ios and 7.0 point 5 says it is supported 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.790
 then clicking jailbreak will start on 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.769
 obviously the video editing process 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.400
 it's speeded up so you don't lose too much 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.880
 time 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.290
 actually it will take about 5 minutes like 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.900
 you see will install the new application 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.730
 ebay john 7 later the iphone 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.519
 it will all restart completely 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.859
 automatic and at some point you tell us 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.620
 please continue to a work your device 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.720
 hands up the new evasion seven icon 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.320
 so when the program asks for it 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.970
 we will have to unlock the iphone and go to 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.549
 open the application that will come 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.549
 previously installed as I did 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.530
 I now recommend you touch the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.329
 your iphone only when you have it 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.670
 he asks if he doesn't ask you for anything 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.230
 touch anything just until 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.480
 jailbreak does not end as you see 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.090
 the iphone will restart another pair 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.880
 of times and during reboot will show 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.310
 these dynamic logos of ideas shaun one 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.950
 once done you will come back from the lockscreen e 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.859
 unlocking your iphone to the post 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:12.950
 the evasion 7 application you will find 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:15.190
 cydia installed on ios 7.0.517.41 and one 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.289
 once this process is over 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.239
 will perform the last reboot and once 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.090
 you will get the device locked 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.730
 use cydia as many times as you like 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.250
 perfection as you see it opens for 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.800
 the mind here in the type of user goes from 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.990
 select developer and once 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.970
 finished loading it remains 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.190
 a very last thing to do 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.740
 see this black bar at the top that yes 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.260
 loading well you don't have to click 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.150
 on nothing you have to let it end for 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.520
 I count on having finished with poles 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.460
 written updating data and jailbreak 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.430
 it will be complete indeed flowing a little 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:06.950
 down here below we can find iphone 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:09.830
 6.2 which would be 5s ios 7.0.517.41 5 o 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.780
