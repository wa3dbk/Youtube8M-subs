 nice all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 this new video has already been well 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 back in this new installment on gta 5 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 in this new video I want to show you and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.159
 explain how to create let's say these 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.900
 tenders issued with all these containers 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.339
 suspended in the air 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.859
 obviously you can't do it only 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.749
 with the container but you can do it like this 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.640
 in short with the ramps with all the 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:40.199
 contraptions you want to explain to you is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.859
 very clear this tutorial on how 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.739
 create them so I applied these 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.309
 hold a little fucking dog 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.859
 just to show you how forlÃ¬ e 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.460
 nothing will explain how to do them like 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.350
 create these races but before you start 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690

 sign up for lost content e 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.550
 I begin to como immediately to create 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.620
 these these sick races if you want to do 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.280
 on a race in this case I do it on 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.280
 a race to ask about the placement 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 accessories 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.260
 then take a container and for example 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.350
 if you know how to lift it from the ground 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.060
 guard in this case look at me it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 I know that lifting it up, lifting it and lifting it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 you have to spire press l3 and r3 l3 and per 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.490
 raise r3 and to lower in this case 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 mine is on session 3 then up 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.480
 xbox do not know with whom they are the keys 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:02.490
 Key dates 18 or l3 r3 to raise r3 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.340
 then to pile up then guys either 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.230
 present and for example you want to create 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 these containers 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.330
 look at everyone 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.170
 attached to each other is very simple 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 you have to choose this container 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.160
 selected no what is called the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.890
 empty container selected no 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.830
 obviously always on the desire to put 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.500
 in the air or on the ground and the same then I had to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.160
 go on if you now have accessories on work 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.550
 and choose the sa that the bags of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.349
 cement select it and you have to put it 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.019
 inside the container 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.750
 look at how his doing yuro you have to 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.560
 put it inside 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 and as soon as you see that the circle is blue 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.260
 you just have to choose the other continues 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.959
 so don't always depress hicks for per 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.590
 select between one contraption and another 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.230
 you must always press hicks for 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.709
 select it from one ignition to another 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.709
 hicks 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.640
 here you have to always press 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:17.690
 repeatedly hicks 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:20.579
 and here's to guys and very very simple 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.359
 then admits if you want to put gods 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.760
 for example, these arrows 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.209
 press hicks and the in select it e 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.730
 put it where you want it 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.030
 and in this way you can create that but 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.239
 look for catches emanated in short, you can 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.319
