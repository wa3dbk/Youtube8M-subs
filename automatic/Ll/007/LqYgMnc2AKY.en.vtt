00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
been put in the service I think the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
been put in the service I think the
actual<00:01:53.220> value<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.820> engine<00:01:54.180> purchase

five<00:01:56.399> thousand<00:01:56.969> dollars<00:01:57.299> there

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
five thousand dollars there

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
five thousand dollars there
guesstimating<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.890> six<00:01:59.100> hundred<00:01:59.369> thousand

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
