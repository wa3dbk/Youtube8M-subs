 the jar is packed into cucumbers 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 so that there is not much left 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.950
 places 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 so layouts on naborchiki on all banks 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 redraw caps that we will 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.060
 close the bank in about 5 minutes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060

 we add 3 tablespoons to buy 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.070
 we put on fire a big pot of water 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 days we will sterilize the jars 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.850
 pour each jar of marinade 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.330
