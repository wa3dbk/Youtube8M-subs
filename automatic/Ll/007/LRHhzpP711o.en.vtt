00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
actually found a way to implement a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.270 
actually found a way to implement a
computer<00:00:34.910> chip<00:00:35.150> into<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.630> fishing<00:00:35.930> reel<00:00:36.280> pretty

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
computer chip into a fishing reel pretty

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.430 
computer chip into a fishing reel pretty
revolutionary<00:00:38.030> stuff<00:00:38.329> what<00:00:38.870> they<00:00:39.020> did<00:00:39.260> they

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
revolutionary stuff what they did they

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.110 
revolutionary stuff what they did they
took<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.860> computer<00:00:40.340> chip<00:00:40.550> their<00:00:40.760> digital

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
took this computer chip their digital

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.389 
took this computer chip their digital
control<00:00:41.510> technology<00:00:42.110> put<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.800> into<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.100> reel

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
control technology put it into this reel

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.549 
control technology put it into this reel
and<00:00:43.609> they<00:00:43.910> basically<00:00:44.210> came<00:00:44.480> up<00:00:44.539> with<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:44.930> 4<00:00:45.350> by<00:00:45.530> 8

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
and they basically came up with a 4 by 8

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.450 
and they basically came up with a 4 by 8
system<00:00:46.100> giving<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.030> 32<00:00:47.539> total<00:00:48.170> total<00:00:48.949> casting

updates the spool constantly whenever

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.410 
updates the spool constantly whenever
you<00:02:09.950> make<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.160> cast<00:02:10.519> so<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.269> always

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
you make a cast so it's always

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you make a cast

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.470 
you make a cast
it's<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> fly<00:02:25.220> into<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.580> wind<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.060> even

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.180 
is smart enough and the computer chip
will<00:02:32.209> update<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.349> speed<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.860> spool

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
will update the the speed of the spool

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.910 
will update the the speed of the spool
in<00:02:34.459> order<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.000> accommodate<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.920> then

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
in order to accommodate for that then

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.550 
in order to accommodate for that then
you<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.450> accuracy<00:02:38.450> mode<00:02:38.780> great<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.379> fishing

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
you have accuracy mode great for fishing

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.680 
you have accuracy mode great for fishing
around<00:02:39.769> docks<00:02:40.220> anytime<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.239> need<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.480> make<00:02:41.660> a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
around docks anytime you need to make a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.750 
around docks anytime you need to make a
really<00:02:42.110> precise<00:02:42.500> cast<00:02:42.860> that's<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.400> setting

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
really precise cast that's the setting

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.360 
really precise cast that's the setting
then<00:02:44.390> long-distance<00:02:45.379> mode<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.769> your<00:02:45.980> everyday

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
then long-distance mode is your everyday

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100 
then long-distance mode is your everyday
kind<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.819> casting<00:02:47.239> conditions<00:02:47.750> if<00:02:47.959> you're

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
kind of casting conditions if you're

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.619 
kind of casting conditions if you're
going<00:02:48.230> down<00:02:48.349> a<00:02:48.470> bank<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:49.069> wanting<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.340> get

going down a bank just wanting to get

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.910 
going down a bank just wanting to get
you<00:02:50.629> know<00:02:50.720> an<00:02:50.810> extra<00:02:51.110> few<00:02:51.319> feet<00:02:51.530> out<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.709> your

you know an extra few feet out of your

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.410 
you know an extra few feet out of your
cast<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:52.819> you're<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> go<00:02:53.209> with

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
cast that's what you're going to go with

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.119 
cast that's what you're going to go with
fishing<00:02:53.930> offshore<00:02:54.079> or<00:02:54.409> something<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:54.829> that

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
fishing offshore or something like that

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.390 
fishing offshore or something like that
now<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.760> extreme<00:02:56.329> casting<00:02:56.599> mode<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.950> used

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now the extreme casting mode is is used

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.039 
now the extreme casting mode is is used
in<00:02:58.549> only<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> very<00:02:59.209> specific<00:02:59.840> set<00:03:00.019> of

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
in only a very specific set of

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.720 
in only a very specific set of
circumstances<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.890> needs<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.310> nearly

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

ideal<00:03:01.910> conditions<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.200> work

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
ideal conditions for this to work

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.430 
ideal conditions for this to work
properly<00:03:03.650> without<00:03:03.980> getting<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.489> backlash<00:03:04.879> so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
properly without getting a backlash so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.619 
properly without getting a backlash so
you've<00:03:06.440> got<00:03:06.620> schooling<00:03:07.129> fish<00:03:07.370> flat<00:03:08.150> column<00:03:08.510> in

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
you've got schooling fish flat column in

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.119 
you've got schooling fish flat column in
the<00:03:08.690> summertime<00:03:09.170> right<00:03:09.410> before<00:03:09.739> dark<00:03:09.920> you've

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
the summertime right before dark you've

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.680 
the summertime right before dark you've
got<00:03:10.310> schooling<00:03:10.760> fish<00:03:10.910> just<00:03:11.239> outside<00:03:11.629> of

got schooling fish just outside of
normal<00:03:11.959> casting<00:03:12.470> range<00:03:12.680> well<00:03:13.099> now<00:03:13.250> you're

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
normal casting range well now you're

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.740 
normal casting range well now you're
going<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:13.790> able<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:14.030> reach<00:03:14.239> those<00:03:14.480> fish

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
going to be able to reach those fish

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.780 
going to be able to reach those fish
with<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.079> extreme<00:03:15.560> casting<00:03:15.799> mode<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.430> lot<00:03:16.670> of

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
with this extreme casting mode a lot of

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
with this extreme casting mode a lot of
guys<00:03:16.910> use<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.359> in<00:03:17.540> casting<00:03:17.989> competitions

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
guys use this in casting competitions

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.309 
guys use this in casting competitions
because<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.980> can<00:03:19.099> cast<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.519> far<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.319> then

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
because you can cast so far with it then

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.780 
because you can cast so far with it then
other<00:03:21.500> than<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.739> all<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.160> need<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.640> to

other than that all you need to do is to

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.849 
other than that all you need to do is to
take<00:03:22.970> your<00:03:23.150> eight<00:03:23.660> setting<00:03:24.079> here<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.440> dial

take your eight setting here and dial

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.080 
take your eight setting here and dial
that<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.250> where<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.489> want<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.849> be<00:03:25.970> and
