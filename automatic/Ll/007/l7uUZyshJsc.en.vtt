 What up aquarium people? ! Fishtanktv.com 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.849
 Dustin's Fish Tanks Types of Sundays. That's right. Roll on you. Causing 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:16.849
 it's up to you. Correct. With one of my favorite plants, Red Tiger lotus. Nymphaea zenkeri 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 . The tiger lotus. It's from West Africa and it's exile okay. Don't miss this species 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.069
 Do not use this type unless you have a dirt tank or substantial surface 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:40.859
 , because it is a very large root grower. Which makes sense from the way it is 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.190
 grows as it grows to the top. As it grows to the top shit houses grows like 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 I want to say. Very cool plant. Love it. Large color patterns. Just really one 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.539
 very cool plant. Many people try to buy these bulbs and plant them. I have never 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.880
 they have had real success and I do not recommend doing it. I recommend you a plant because there 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 Then dud bulbs you can never know how they were treated before. So that's my thought 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.650
 on that. Really great installation I received a few plants I try it with little 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 light, lots of light. This plant has CO2 every now and then. It is from Guinea West Africa. The 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.960
 needs a lot of nutrients. They say it's to trim. I never actually trimmed 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 the. I let it grow to the top for the antenna benefit. It becomes more CO2 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.980
 it does better. Large plant. Really like it. Good contrast. You don't see red ones naturally 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 plants that you don't have to add too much iron to. This is a plant that will get you away 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 with no addition of a lot of iron just a lot of substrate. So I think it's everyone 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.950
 does dirt check it out. Types of Sundays, people.
