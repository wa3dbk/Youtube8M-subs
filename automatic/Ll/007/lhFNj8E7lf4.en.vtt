00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
done shot full screen there same same

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
done shot full screen there same same
same<00:01:08.640> presentation<00:01:09.600> basically<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> little

same presentation basically a little

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
same presentation basically a little
closer<00:01:11.100> look<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.150> sees<00:01:12.390> slow

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
closer look at it then he sees slow

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
closer look at it then he sees slow
rotation<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> tornado's<00:01:15.000> booth<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
rotation and if a tornado's booth can

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
rotation and if a tornado's booth can
manually<00:01:15.570> expects<00:01:15.990> come<00:01:16.320> fast<00:01:16.619> rotation<00:01:17.100> if

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
manually expects come fast rotation if

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
manually expects come fast rotation if
you're<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.509> close<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> storm<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you're if you're close to the storm on

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
you're if you're close to the storm on
that<00:01:20.759> more<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.280> Alan<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that more so when Alan is that is just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.460 
that more so when Alan is that is just
in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> Lamont<00:01:26.460> area<00:01:26.729> what's<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.119> storm

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
in the Lamont area what's in this storm

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.810 
in the Lamont area what's in this storm
that's<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.560> dry<00:01:28.950> area<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> country's<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that's a very dry area the country's I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.069 
that's a very dry area the country's I
felt<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.119> getting<00:01:30.390> rain<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
felt I getting rain they can get up that

felt I getting rain they can get up that
way<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> way<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.570> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
way and so I was up that way we have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
way and so I was up that way we have
Marty<00:01:33.960> down<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> west<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.280> another

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
Marty down just to the west here another

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.740 
Marty down just to the west here another
some<00:01:36.509> type<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.720> scarcity<00:01:37.259> region<00:01:38.600> rotating

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.170 

rotating<00:01:42.740> rotating<00:01:43.400> drug<00:01:43.610> den<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.060> have

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
rotating rotating drug den so you have

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.210 
rotating rotating drug den so you have
rotators<00:01:44.660> there<00:01:44.870> we've<00:01:45.470> got<00:01:45.590> one<00:01:45.770> western

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
rotators there we've got one western

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.850 
rotators there we've got one western
Oklahoma<00:01:46.850> let<00:01:47.030> me<00:01:47.120> put<00:01:47.330> them<00:01:47.510> up<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:47.810> Vice<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.350> so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
Oklahoma let me put them up on Vice I so

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.980 
Oklahoma let me put them up on Vice I so
as<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.070> mesocyclone<00:01:49.970> would<00:01:50.420> once<00:01:50.720> again<00:01:50.780> we

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
as a mesocyclone would once again we

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.670 
as a mesocyclone would once again we
have<00:01:51.110> 22<00:01:51.560> storm<00:01:51.950> trackers<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.680> can

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
have 22 storm trackers on it and can
