00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
has like a really kind of I want to say

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
has like a really kind of I want to say
waxy<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> gel<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
waxy but it's like a gel kind of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660 
waxy but it's like a gel kind of
consistency<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.559> solid<00:00:59.100> gel<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
consistency but more so a solid gel so I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
consistency but more so a solid gel so I
do<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.140> main<00:01:01.289> reason<00:01:01.649> why

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
do like this one and the main reason why

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.750 
do like this one and the main reason why
I<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> kinnor<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.760> mainly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I do like this on so kinnor is mainly

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
I do like this on so kinnor is mainly
because<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:07.020> gel<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.860> do

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
because it's not like gel so when you do

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.410 
because it's not like gel so when you do
put<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.580> hair<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> gives<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> hair

feel like this product will work better
for<00:05:38.730> textures<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.600> are<00:05:39.990> probably<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.830> little

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
for textures that are probably a little

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.830 
for textures that are probably a little
bit<00:05:41.190> looser<00:05:41.640> maybe<00:05:41.850> for<00:05:42.090> 3c<00:05:42.510> like<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.780> think

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
bit looser maybe for 3c like I think

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.690 
bit looser maybe for 3c like I think
