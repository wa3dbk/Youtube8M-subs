setting up your scope for a certain
distance<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.550> don't<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> compensate

distance you don't have to compensate
for<00:00:24.480> bullet<00:00:24.750> drop<00:00:24.779> anymore<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:25.590> explain

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
for bullet drop anymore I will explain

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400 
for bullet drop anymore I will explain
it<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> few<00:00:26.430> seconds<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.720> you

can<00:00:28.560> toggle<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> variable<00:00:29.609> zoom

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
can toggle through the variable zoom

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.420 
there's bullet drop so we're aiming too
low<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.980> hit<00:00:41.129> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
low to hit it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mouth don't get confused with the vapour

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
mouth don't get confused with the vapour
trail<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.739> covering<00:00:47.039> up

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
trail because it's actually covering up

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.959 
trail because it's actually covering up
the<00:00:47.430> weight<00:00:47.760> wool<00:00:48.030> drop<00:00:48.270> goes<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> bail<00:00:50.610> 53

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the weight wool drop goes so bail 53

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.369 
the weight wool drop goes so bail 53
would<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.780> aimed<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.140> bit

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
would just would have aimed a little bit

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
would just would have aimed a little bit
higher<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.430> gotten<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> nose<00:00:53.940> but

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
higher we would have gotten the nose but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
higher we would have gotten the nose but
now<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.260> zeroing<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.430> our

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
now we have zeroing so we get out our

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
now we have zeroing so we get out our
PLD<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> buildin<00:00:57.660> rangefinder<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> we

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
PLD with a buildin rangefinder and we

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
PLD with a buildin rangefinder and we
see<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.920> guys<00:00:59.100> approximately<00:00:59.699> 200<00:01:00.120> meters

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
see the guys approximately 200 meters

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.399 
see the guys approximately 200 meters
away<00:01:00.530> now<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.039> our<00:01:02.070> sniper<00:01:02.309> rifle

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
away now we go back to our sniper rifle

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.200 
away now we go back to our sniper rifle
aim<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.559> him<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.519> zero<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> V<00:01:07.380> key<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
aim at him and we zero with the V key on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
aim at him and we zero with the V key on
the<00:01:09.210> keyboard<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the keyboard you can see it also on the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.330 
the keyboard you can see it also on the
bottom<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.490> screen<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.970> person<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.340> now

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
bottom of your screen a person now now

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.810 
bottom of your screen a person now now
we're<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.580> 200<00:01:15.000> meters<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.409> shoot<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.650> now

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
we're at 200 meters if I shoot them now

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.190 
we're at 200 meters if I shoot them now
we<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.540> hitting<00:01:18.869> its<00:01:19.049> nose

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we see we're actually hitting its nose

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
we see we're actually hitting its nose
because<00:01:19.710> our<00:01:19.920> scope<00:01:20.220> center<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> our

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
because our scope center of our

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
because our scope center of our
crosshairs<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:21.840> calibrated<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.619> 200

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
crosshairs are not calibrated for 200

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.810 
crosshairs are not calibrated for 200
meters<00:01:24.049> however<00:01:25.049> wrong<00:01:25.770> zeroing<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.460> example

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
meters however wrong zeroing for example

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.170 
meters however wrong zeroing for example
1000<00:01:27.330> meters<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> bullet<00:01:29.909> goes

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
1000 meters like this the bullet goes

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.510 
1000 meters like this the bullet goes
all<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.130> bush<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
all the way up here so the bush is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
all the way up here so the bush is
actually<00:01:33.240> flying<00:01:33.509> higher<00:01:33.900> than<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> shoot<00:01:34.500> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually flying higher than the shoot in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually flying higher than the shoot in
order<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> hit<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> target<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> distance

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
order to hit the target at the distance

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
order to hit the target at the distance
so<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.549> compensating<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
so it's actually compensating for the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
so it's actually compensating for the
bullet<00:01:39.060> drop<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.450> advance<00:01:39.920> however<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
bullet drop in advance however if you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.289 
bullet drop in advance however if you
have<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> tricky<00:01:42.150> distance<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:43.079> example<00:01:43.110> like

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
have a tricky distance for example like

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.109 
have a tricky distance for example like
250<00:01:45.299> meters<00:01:46.310> can<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.680> yes<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.710> we're

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
250 meters can we do this yes now we're

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
250 meters can we do this yes now we're
250<00:01:51.119> meters<00:01:51.360> away<00:01:51.479> from<00:01:51.600> him<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.610> should

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
250 meters away from him so what should

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.060 
250 meters away from him so what should
I<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.060> zero<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.380> 200<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.759> 300

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
I do now zero in for 200 or for 300

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.539 
I do now zero in for 200 or for 300
so<00:01:59.070> they're<00:01:59.549> both<00:01:59.759> possible<00:02:00.630> ways<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.369> aim

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
so they're both possible ways if you aim

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.359 
so they're both possible ways if you aim
or<00:02:02.969> zero<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.630> 200<00:02:04.140> we'll<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> come<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
or zero in at 200 we'll have to come and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
or zero in at 200 we'll have to come and
see<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> bullet<00:02:05.790> drop<00:02:05.969> by<00:02:06.149> aiming<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.540> little

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
see if a bullet drop by aiming a little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
see if a bullet drop by aiming a little
bit<00:02:06.930> higher<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.590> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
bit higher like this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840 
bit higher like this
good<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.600> there<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.900> go<00:02:10.290> however<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
good and there you go however you can

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.300 
good and there you go however you can
also<00:02:12.030> zero<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.720> 300<00:02:13.470> meters<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:14.040> this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
also zero in for 300 meters like this

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
also zero in for 300 meters like this
but<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.810> aim<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.170> little

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
but then you will have to aim a little

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.170 
but then you will have to aim a little
bit<00:02:16.590> lower<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.550> that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
bit lower like that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.110 
bit lower like that
so<00:02:18.960> you'll<00:02:19.080> hit<00:02:19.170> your<00:02:19.230> target<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.910> yeah<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
so you'll hit your target but yeah I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.540 
so you'll hit your target but yeah I
think<00:02:21.240> pretty<00:02:21.870> much<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.410> feel<00:02:23.070> free<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.310> use
