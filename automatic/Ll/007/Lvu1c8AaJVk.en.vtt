 Minecraft update but more than 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.950

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.310
 thing also that I wanted to comment on 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.350
 Today is about fatal frame fatal 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.310

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.899

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.790
 store and according to the playstation blog 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
 this game is coming and the truth is that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.590

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.660
 for the playstation network 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.009
 so if you 've never played a fatal frame 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.390

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.410
