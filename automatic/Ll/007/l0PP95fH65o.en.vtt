linear<00:00:44.390> throttle<00:00:45.019> response<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.649> it's<00:00:45.769> not<00:00:45.890> as

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
linear throttle response so it's not as

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
her feature key if you're going through

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.619 
her feature key if you're going through
the<00:00:48.050> gears<00:00:48.289> real<00:00:48.530> quick<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.309> smoother<00:00:49.820> which

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
the gears real quick it's smoother which

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.759 
the gears real quick it's smoother which
is<00:00:50.750> kind<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.019> what<00:00:51.170> they<00:00:51.289> wanted<00:00:51.559> with<00:00:51.679> the

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
is kind of what they wanted with the

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.220 
is kind of what they wanted with the
touring<00:00:52.160> bike<00:00:52.370> it's<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:53.449> little<00:00:53.719> bit<00:00:53.839> slower

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
touring bike it's a little bit slower

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.829 
touring bike it's a little bit slower
but<00:00:54.620> at<00:00:55.100> 880<00:00:55.789> pounds<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.239> really<00:00:56.480> don't<00:00:56.660> want

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
but at 880 pounds you really don't want

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.829 
but at 880 pounds you really don't want
to<00:00:56.870> be<00:00:56.960> going<00:00:57.230> too<00:00:57.440> fast<00:00:57.769> around<00:00:58.309> this<00:00:58.839> turns

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
to be going too fast around this turns

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
but it's kind of deceiving because this

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.830

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
handle brake and then the middle one is

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.590 
handle brake and then the middle one is
activated<00:04:10.460> with<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.670> brake<00:04:11.060> for<00:04:11.300> the<00:04:11.330> back

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
activated with the brake for the back

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.010 
activated with the brake for the back
when<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.530> push<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:12.950> back<00:04:13.940> brake<00:04:14.270> down<00:04:14.600> it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
when you push the back brake down it

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.509 
when you push the back brake down it
activates<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.590> middle<00:04:15.860> piston<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.340> gives

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
activates the middle piston and gives

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.300 
activates the middle piston and gives
you<00:04:16.640> some<00:04:16.850> stopping<00:04:17.150> force<00:04:17.570> in<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.840> front<00:04:18.310> but

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
you some stopping force in the front but

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.039 
you some stopping force in the front but
if<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.610> really<00:04:19.790> need<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.060> panic<00:04:20.450> stop<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.930> want

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
if you really need a panic stop you want

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.540 
if you really need a panic stop you want
to<00:04:21.140> grab<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.530> handlebar<00:04:21.980> because<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.250> adds<00:04:22.400> a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
to grab the handlebar because it adds a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.610 
to grab the handlebar because it adds a
lot<00:04:22.790> more<00:04:23.030> force<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.540> that<00:04:23.690> three<00:04:23.990> piston<00:04:24.380> set

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
lot more force to that three piston set

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.250 
lot more force to that three piston set
up<00:04:24.770> her<00:04:24.950> side<00:04:25.840> back<00:04:26.840> also<00:04:27.230> got<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> disc<00:04:27.920> brake

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
up her side back also got a disc brake

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
also vented can't really see it here

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.920

two piston it's the back brake it
doesn't<00:04:39.170> do<00:04:39.230> that<00:04:39.380> much<00:04:39.590> work<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.310> works

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
doesn't do that much work and it works

this<00:04:40.880> thing<00:04:41.090> stops<00:04:41.420> really<00:04:42.010> controllably<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
this thing stops really controllably and

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.340 
this thing stops really controllably and
pretty<00:04:43.610> quick<00:04:43.910> especially<00:04:44.870> considering<00:04:45.290> how

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
pretty quick especially considering how

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.660 
pretty quick especially considering how
heavy<00:04:47.230> controls<00:04:48.230> are<00:04:48.410> real<00:04:48.530> easy<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.920> grab<00:04:49.220> and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
heavy controls are real easy to grab and

easy within my reach the handlebars are
2<00:04:55.130> inches<00:04:55.490> wider<00:04:55.820> than<00:04:56.030> on<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.419> M<00:04:56.570> version<00:04:57.040> and

they<00:05:06.650> think<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.010> because<00:05:07.340> of<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.669> 2<00:05:07.820> inch

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
they think it's because of the 2 inch

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.150 
they think it's because of the 2 inch
wider<00:05:08.180> handlebars<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.140> generally<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:09.890> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
wider handlebars and generally just the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.000 
wider handlebars and generally just the
difference<00:05:11.120> in<00:05:11.210> suspension<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:11.870> all<00:05:12.020> that

difference in suspension and all that

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.140 
difference in suspension and all that
really<00:05:13.220> surprised<00:05:13.550> me<00:05:13.730> because<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.090> N

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
really surprised me because the N

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.909 
really surprised me because the N
version<00:05:14.600> is<00:05:14.690> kind<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.080> racing<00:05:15.560> bike<00:05:15.740> and

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
version is kind of a racing bike and

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.170 
version is kind of a racing bike and
this<00:05:15.980> is<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.250> touring<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.700> they<00:05:16.850> said<00:05:17.060> this

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
this is the touring and they said this

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:26.000 
this is the touring and they said this
one<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.390> easier

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.040
