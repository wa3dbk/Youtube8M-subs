you think of this study and if you agree

you think of this study and if you agree
with<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> notion<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.060> women<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.660> better

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
with the notion that women are better

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
with the notion that women are better
drivers<00:02:40.380> than<00:02:40.410> men<00:02:40.770> that's<00:02:41.130> all<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.460> me<00:02:41.580> but

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
drivers than men that's all for me but
