00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.100
 age of screening genre may listeners 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 and today we have the first rock 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.399
 how to start the car 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.619
 Immediately make a reservation that an experienced percentage 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.469
 long it will not be interesting 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.109
 our lessons are designed for 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.989
 novice drivers 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.480
 who never sat behind the wheel 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 want to learn 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.550
 how was the driving 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 so what how but learning to wind up 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.149
 car for example we will pass 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.410
 sleep 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.660
 percent 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.090
 ford cars 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.720
 percentage he has 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.239
 steering lock 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.730
 as they say for could with a clutch unlock here 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.680
 this one is the key 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.850
 to start 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.640
 we need to check the speed 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.590
 car speed we will pass 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.900
 manual transmission 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.430
 percent switch 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 specify levers 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.010
 percent now the car is on 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 neutral speed it means you can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 erect many drivers of the place 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.330
 parking something from this 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 use a percentage how would he 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.470
 I don't lock the gearbox 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.390
 car 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 whatever he went 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440
 here from now stands the car at first 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 speeds 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 either we sometimes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.790
 includes so here and she as here too 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 will not hide anywhere 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.369
 if you start the car at the same time 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.480
 condition 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.070
 car start moving forward 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 we do not need it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.130
 and that was 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 that is, as if 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.610
 we can ohh create our own situation 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.390
 if you imagine a person or 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.530
 car empty him 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.490
 in simple terms 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.680
 what do you need to do to make it 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.510
 get started 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.650
 percent 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.990
 at first 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.590
 need to check the speed 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.760
 that is, his turochak hours but the second 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.840
 speed will make we need to turn it on 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350
 neutral let's say speed and after 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 this plant 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.680
 but 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.950
 it turns on very simply 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 vol 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.429
 every car 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.089
 on top of a lever there is such a gives 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.419
 the lesson is like speed gears here 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.079
 I see on this 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.499
 first speed second third and 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.559
 fourth fifth required speed 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.459
 and the second speed 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.489
 here and now my car is on 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.009
 second speed 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.419
 product 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.239
 I will simply advise you which is easy 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.169
 do well that is 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.139
 how to put the car on 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.099
 neutral speed 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.279
 squeeze the clutch pedal 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.420
 here it is the most extreme side on its side showed 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.809
 I'm sorry of course I spent a whole hour 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.919
 Balakovo but not very clean 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.930
 already in May 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.559
 clutch pedal 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.559
 in the world 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.749
 even if your car is on 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.469
 like speed 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.099
 that is, Moscow, if I now have 20 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.849
 debate 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.249
 then the car will not start the course 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.459
 It will start like at speed but it is not 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.769
 very correct 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.129
 you need to squeeze the clutch on and off 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.929
 speed 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.099
 put like a young neutral Kiichiro 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.939
 checks freely go here and there 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.080
 vodka 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.260
 checked as here and beginners 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.450
 drivers that is 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.809
 neutral speed 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.719
 we check how 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.619
 We put first on the first speed 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.059
 see by 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.479
 Meskheti first speed 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.429
 and then just turn it off 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.629
 turn off 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.439
 that is, we return as if to the original 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.129
 standing if you will be excluded 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.269
 second speed 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.229
 accordingly, how would you 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.099
 inconsistency sport system sc 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.599
 2 hours reading 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.489
 in may agree as 1 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.249
 that is, we contract speed sperm with 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.979
 secret grass all 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.279
 in a neutral stadium 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.069
 the percentage is all done 3 our and you 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.410
 there is 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.289
 car clutch pedals 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.269
 all put on neutral 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.010
 speed 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.249
 then take a clinch 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.249
 insert the keyhole 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.379
 we deliver the car 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.319
 lotion show turns on the tea 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.360
 in the trenches are turning now 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080
 car ignition switched on 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 he did not rule out ignition 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.830
 i.e. car but ready 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.669
 mushroom plant king further fish factory 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.539
 I still wound up in the car as if 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.259
 to see ours, we obliged individuals to begin 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.279
 work 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.029
 speed we have no equal therefore 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 car carrier did not sleep 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.650
 but in general this is not counting the actions 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.800
 my hero lessons 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.909
 but how to start the car 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.150
 maybe he by the way also was earlier he 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.499
 car stalled 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.580
 turn again 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.939
 and here's an asker turn on 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.269
 is it about car licorice 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:21.219
 the following lessons we will be a nightingale 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.650
 pass 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.770
 and how to get under way 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.460
 so look 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.210
 our video tutorials 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.660
 the best video lessons right then the border 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.290
 point
