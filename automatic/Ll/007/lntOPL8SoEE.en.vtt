00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Good day, my name is Ali 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.899
 monday and we have all our girls 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 uber and shoot today or rather 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 already laid out so which is dedicated to 23 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 February 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 the hives or linens have faded and loved ones 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.000
 male authors and strain want sheep 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 the forest 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.250
 although there is probably nothing better for me 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.250
 paint 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.230
 which is just a lot of people in one 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.800
 the same day I spread such long 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.930
 video 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 a little bit you can get tired of it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.340
 If we look at 10 in a row, we understand 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.520
 why not make such a shift 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.140
 setting cancel installation 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.330
 accept and I decided it seems so 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.850
 changing the situation to shoot a video that is not 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.670
 filmed a very very long time and in fact 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.390

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.970
 10 most interesting things that to me 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.369
 managed to find about this author 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.830

 life all is calm he says that 2nd 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.340
 components of creativity is his wife and 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.530
 a piece of luck, unlike many 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.299
 writers mind and she macrina is not some 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.519
 certain routine for which he 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.870
 writes, that is, it is not in his or sit 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.420
 he writes for his novel only then 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.780
 when he has both inspiration and continue 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.400
 write only as long as we are with him and 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.799
 last 10 fans when it comes to 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.190

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.410
 accuracy and clarity of sentences and the text 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.360
 multivalued as well as some stress 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.250
 which can occur between 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.959
 the sentences sound really 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.329
 a little bit strange but if you read 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.400
 some of the novels mcqueen it all 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.530
 make very clear sense 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.989
 I guess that's why I love his books. 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.380
 on simply unique and inimitable 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.270
 style 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.150
