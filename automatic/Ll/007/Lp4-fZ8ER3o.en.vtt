00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.009
 saved space users are 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.150
 doctor white we are here today with a new one 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.099
 career episode on 2k times 14 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 our career with maize gm la 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 team choice is that of boston 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.529
 I read in the comments to 15 years 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.820
 unfortunately I don't decide to change teams 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 I this team all decided 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 together to start with the boston 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 celtics so now I wanted to do at least 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 the second year maybe next year 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 on m2k 15 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.910
 we will begin not composed yet another 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.890
 team first of all two games 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 I should be back this week 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 unequal were two games against teams 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.110
 of the eastern conference 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 if I have not seen badly we have finished the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 matches against team teams 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.800
 of the coast sorry adversaries and therefore 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 all matches against teams from 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.440
 western conference then more to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.870
 flow 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 it's a week that went wrong because it is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.969
 bad because they were two games a lot 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.100
 fought and at least the first life 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.609
 against the toronto raptors that is one 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 poor team because we are scarce 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.570
 in the boston you feel are scarce but at least 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 we have a player like harris wants 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.909
 people who later settled on the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 game 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.920
 toronto these players why 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 however I give so many heats 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 many players but I think he's wrong 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.409
 completely in that roof the coach 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 of toronto because because it continues to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 use de rosa for three plays with a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 very low quintet so it doesn't 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 not even playing ros who is a player 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 very good on the game is indeed only one 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 made to play like six minutes then 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.720
 completely wrong training 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 so he left me slightly away 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.579
 free even under the basket where I am a 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 so lacking with the long so I have 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.570
 took command of the operations are 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.420
 always been ahead 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 toronto is back below at least 5 minus 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.090
 6 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.250
 but then I put all the players back on the field 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.790
 owners and I have also gone ahead of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.890
 20 25 points so I have to say game 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 excellent I didn't even have to play 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 owners very much in I could do 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 play some reservations 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.490
 good performance on attack harris 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560
 john wall 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.299
 so I was really satisfied 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.920
 this team 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.600
 but it must be said that toronto was 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 really poor so it wasn't a test 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 who could prove much of the strength of the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.680
 boston celtics 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.239
 in view of next year here 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.050
 match statistics john wall 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.180
 always in double double now beyond 15 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.010
 points 8 rebounds at basketball rates that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.440
 the only one who saves himself with the john wall 19 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.660
 points 6 rebounds 21 assists good 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.090
 performance of belinelli with 19 and 26 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.819
 tobias herre the second game was 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.440
 certainly more difficult we played for 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.330
 the chicago bulls that should have taken 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.700
 shannon brown on the free agent market 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.550
 so great team 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.650
 obviously here and roses is present is not 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.769
 injured so we had the challenge between 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.600
 john gol and derrick roses who are two among 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.519
 the strongest climate to be fulfilled 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.880
 then obviously together with rajon rondo 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.650
 two excellent playmaker balanced challenge 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.349
 at the beginning I was even in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 advantage then carlos boozer but done 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.349
 really really suffer because at that 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.630
 tironi falls backwards that is 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.370
 impossible for nothing to stop with 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.980
 this was in contact because in the first 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.110
 and according to how much I have been in contact and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.330
 I also played good found 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.130
 I had a good shooting percentage 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.660
 of adversaries however they succeeded you know 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.220
 score but could never do 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.799
 that break that I usually take against 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.620
 the strong teams made the first half 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.780
 I'm down by only 4 points in the third 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.640
 fourth a disaster really happens 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.410
 more marks it breaks loose with a tier 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.430
 iii the kind here I really defended 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.769
 really bad 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.440
 I started having trouble with fouls 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.940
 really with my role I had several 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.519
 fouls whistled against then he had 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.900
 five fouls for almost the entire second 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.880
 time on the other side also noah I think 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.799
 boozer and roses arrived with 5 bars 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.120
 6 fouls at the end so it's just one 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.000
 many shots with many fouls 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.980
 free throws by both teams 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.720
 I must say that I was losing then I have 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.459
 thought this break when by now 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
 only three minutes and fifty were missing 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.350
 at the end several counter-attacks arrive 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.600
 with crushed both from r and from pavirani 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.299
 however good defense would have done 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.030
 so many blocked then even 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.380
 this wall basket also arrives 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.389
 I risked a lot because if 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.000
 I took the breakthrough would have been 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.190
 out for six fouls then let's look here 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.810
 the last action will be below 2 ball 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.549
 lost leader who goes to shoot 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.150
 quite the wrong course there is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.009
 faber has what they jump 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.240
 but takes the rebound marks two points 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:29.220
 amanda overturn and then draw 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.630
 additional match that by now was ep 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.090
 that my players are doing 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.350
 really everything possible to win a 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.650
 see you john wall going to 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.479
 crush in the head jason then has 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.130
 boozer drives a minibreak for chicago 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.410
 which goes another 5 with a minute and 30 from 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.139
 play but then the soul of yours 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.190
 celtics allows me to recover 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.110
 win this game even 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.550
 therefore two victories out of two is therefore 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.410
 very bad because we have to 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.180
 tank areas we have made two victories on 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.010
 two so no apple together in sight 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.260
 the droid pro win is always good 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.020
 help quickly team up in 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.699
 36 fans with today we have concluded if 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.979
 the video well liked left like a 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.289
 comment 6 search I wanted to do the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.910
 play today you are a general 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.770
 manager you have to rebuild completely 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.870
 a team don't take real players 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.910
 it's just a hypothetical thing who by whom 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.860
 start rebuilding this team from 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.530
 a play maker from one center to one 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.990
 demon guard comments I will tell you a 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.820
 center because the height is the only one 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
 which you can't teach basketball 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.889
 so we will see each other soon 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.889
 Hi everyone
