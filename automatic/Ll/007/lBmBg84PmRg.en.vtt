procedure is the same we need to remove
the<00:00:19.020> fuel<00:00:19.350> from<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> machine<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.939> reason<00:00:21.359> for

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the fuel from the machine the reason for

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
the fuel from the machine the reason for
this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.830> fuel<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> stay<00:00:23.910> in

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this is that if the fuel was to stay in

condensation and the constituent parts

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
condensation and the constituent parts
of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> fuel<00:00:30.179> could<00:00:30.330> break<00:00:30.599> down<00:00:30.630> leaving

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
of the fuel could break down leaving

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.220 
of the fuel could break down leaving
harmful<00:00:32.070> deposits<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.390> those<00:00:33.570> deposits

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
into the mixing bottle there we go now

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.740 
into the mixing bottle there we go now
I'm<00:01:04.100> quite<00:01:04.309> sure<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.879> tanks<00:01:05.269> empty<00:01:05.630> now

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
I'm quite sure that that tanks empty now
