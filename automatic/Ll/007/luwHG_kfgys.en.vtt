00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
on a grand scale we've got GTA 5 where

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.410 
on a grand scale we've got GTA 5 where
you<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.260> big<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> majority

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you think it's big but then the majority

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
you think it's big but then the majority
of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:39.930> will<00:00:40.079> confirm<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.860> big

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of the people will confirm it's not big

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
of the people will confirm it's not big
enough<00:00:41.390> but<00:00:42.390> there's<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.200> already

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
enough but there's so much to go already

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.459 
enough but there's so much to go already
but<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> always<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:44.969> le<00:00:45.870> dangerous<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
but we always want more le dangerous is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
but we always want more le dangerous is
probably<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> game<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.670> well<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
probably a game like that as well and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060 
probably a game like that as well and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
find things that maybe you can survey

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320 
find things that maybe you can survey
and<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.889> can<00:04:32.069> take<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> data<00:04:32.669> back<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:32.970> you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
and you can take the data back and you

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.909 
and you can take the data back and you
can<00:04:33.509> actually<00:04:33.690> maybe<00:04:33.990> build<00:04:34.470> an<00:04:34.620> outpost

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
can actually maybe build an outpost

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.219 
can actually maybe build an outpost
somewhere<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:36.180> I'm<00:04:36.270> very<00:04:36.330> excited<00:04:36.539> for<00:04:37.110> that

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
somewhere so I'm very excited for that

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.950 
somewhere so I'm very excited for that
as<00:04:37.379> well<00:04:37.409> and<00:04:37.770> that's<00:04:38.310> where<00:04:38.699> Neptune<00:04:39.569> flux

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
as well and that's where Neptune flux

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.360 
as well and that's where Neptune flux
and<00:04:40.169> Fox<00:04:40.379> machina<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:40.949> really<00:04:41.190> got<00:04:41.310> me

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
and Fox machina it really got me

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.270 
and Fox machina it really got me
thinking<00:04:41.569> both<00:04:42.569> of<00:04:42.750> these<00:04:42.900> games<00:04:43.259> do<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> really

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
thinking both of these games do a really

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.640 
thinking both of these games do a really
good<00:04:44.580> job<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.150> exactly<00:04:45.780> what<00:04:46.020> they<00:04:46.169> made<00:04:46.409> for

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
good job and exactly what they made for

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.159 
good job and exactly what they made for
you<00:04:47.220> know<00:04:47.370> you'll<00:04:48.000> be<00:04:48.150> able<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.330> walk<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.960> Mac

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
you know you'll be able to walk in a Mac

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.369 
you know you'll be able to walk in a Mac
you'll<00:04:49.889> be<00:04:50.009> able<00:04:50.129> to<00:04:50.360> swim<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:52.020> submarine

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
you'll be able to swim in a submarine

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.930 
you'll be able to swim in a submarine
and<00:04:52.680> they<00:04:52.919> do<00:04:53.069> a<00:04:53.099> really<00:04:53.280> good<00:04:53.550> job<00:04:53.580> at<00:04:53.909> that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
and they do a really good job at that

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.749 
and they do a really good job at that
and<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.870> really<00:04:55.349> hope<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:56.159> elite<00:04:56.550> dangerous

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
and I really hope that elite dangerous

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.480 
and I really hope that elite dangerous
frontier<00:04:57.720> developments<00:04:57.990> will<00:04:58.979> be<00:04:59.099> able<00:04:59.280> to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
frontier developments will be able to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.279 
frontier developments will be able to
take<00:04:59.699> elite<00:05:00.000> dangerous<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.569> the<00:05:00.659> next<00:05:00.990> level

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
take elite dangerous to the next level

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.710 
take elite dangerous to the next level
by<00:05:01.860> implementing<00:05:02.460> these<00:05:02.970> kind<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.509> game

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
by implementing these kind of game

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.689 
by implementing these kind of game
mechanics<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.440> making<00:05:05.159> elite<00:05:05.490> dangerous

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
mechanics and making elite dangerous

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.120 
mechanics and making elite dangerous
that<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.539> game<00:05:06.900> where<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.949> do

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
that one game where you can do

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.600 
that one game where you can do
everything<00:05:08.669> for<00:05:09.630> now<00:05:09.780> airless<00:05:10.680> moons<00:05:10.949> airless

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
everything for now airless moons airless

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.850 
everything for now airless moons airless
planets<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.870> next<00:05:13.169> step<00:05:13.349> obviously

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
planets the next step obviously

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.490 
planets the next step obviously
atmosphere<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.479> go<00:05:15.659> down<00:05:15.870> on<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> planet

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
atmosphere so you go down on a planet

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040 
atmosphere so you go down on a planet
with<00:05:16.650> water<00:05:16.940> you'll<00:05:17.940> be<00:05:18.120> able<00:05:18.240> to<00:05:18.389> take<00:05:18.870> your

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
with water you'll be able to take your

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.230 
with water you'll be able to take your
car<00:05:19.289> out<00:05:19.469> or<00:05:19.710> your<00:05:19.830> Mac<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.639> drive<00:05:20.880> up<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.150> the

car out or your Mac you drive up to the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.510 
car out or your Mac you drive up to the
water<00:05:21.479> you<00:05:22.259> lower<00:05:22.530> your<00:05:22.710> submarine<00:05:23.159> in<00:05:23.310> there

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
water you lower your submarine in there

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.029 
water you lower your submarine in there
