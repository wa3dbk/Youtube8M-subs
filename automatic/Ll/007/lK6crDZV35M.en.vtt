00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
alright now the thing the difference

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.160 
alright now the thing the difference
here<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.740> genetics<00:01:59.430> right<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
here is the genetics right so when you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.940 
here is the genetics right so when you
have<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> goal<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> say<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.950> 180

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have a goal of say I want to be 180

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
have a goal of say I want to be 180
pounds<00:02:05.520> ten<00:02:05.790> percent<00:02:06.210> body<00:02:06.420> fat<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.259> don't

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
pounds ten percent body fat you don't

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.770 
pounds ten percent body fat you don't
know<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> look<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
know what that's going to look like you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.300 
know what that's going to look like you
can<00:02:10.080> find<00:02:10.379> somebody<00:02:10.739> who's<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> hundred

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
can find somebody who's a hundred

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.390 
can find somebody who's a hundred
pounds<00:02:12.819> at<00:02:12.940> 10%<00:02:13.330> body<00:02:13.750> fat<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.920> chances<00:02:15.160> are

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
pounds at 10% body fat but chances are

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.510 
pounds at 10% body fat but chances are
you're<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.390> look<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.900> way<00:02:17.520> now

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
you're not going to look that way now

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240 
you're not going to look that way now
you'll<00:02:18.819> be<00:02:18.849> just<00:02:19.300> as<00:02:19.510> lean<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.069> 10%<00:02:21.069> body

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
you'll be just as lean because 10% body

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.440 
you'll be just as lean because 10% body
fat<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.819> 10%<00:02:22.450> body<00:02:22.599> fat<00:02:22.800> however<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.730> way<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
fat is 10% body fat however the way the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.470 
fat is 10% body fat however the way the
muscle<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.110> structured<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.120> be<00:02:28.239> much

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
muscle is structured is going to be much

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080 
muscle is structured is going to be much
different<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:29.470> guy<00:02:29.650> might<00:02:29.980> look<00:02:30.280> huge<00:02:30.670> one

guy<00:02:31.450> might<00:02:31.810> look<00:02:32.110> small<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.420> here's<00:02:35.290> what<00:02:35.470> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
guy might look small so here's what I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.580 
guy might look small so here's what I
want<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.040> realize<00:02:36.849> okay<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.959> some

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
want you to realize okay is that some

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.000 
want you to realize okay is that some
guys<00:02:38.800> have<00:02:39.489> better<00:02:40.200> muscle<00:02:41.200> bellies<00:02:41.739> than

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
guys have better muscle bellies than

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.539 
guys have better muscle bellies than
other<00:02:42.250> some<00:02:42.970> guys<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.510> more<00:02:43.930> room<00:02:44.799> for<00:02:44.830> more

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
other some guys have more room for more

muscles<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:50.610> most<00:02:51.610> people<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.750> about

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
muscles and most people have about

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.699 
muscles and most people have about
average<00:02:54.280> genetics<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> terms<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.630> how<00:02:56.470> much

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
average genetics in terms of how much

average genetics in terms of how much
muscle<00:02:56.980> they<00:02:57.220> can<00:02:57.400> build<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.209> most

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
muscle they can build so for the most

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.640 
muscle they can build so for the most
part<00:02:58.620> everybody<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.950> build<00:03:00.220> about<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.120> same

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
part everybody can build about the same

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.580 
part everybody can build about the same
amount<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.799> muscle<00:03:03.220> right<00:03:04.200> excluding<00:03:05.200> the

amount of muscle right excluding the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.380 
amount of muscle right excluding the

guys with honestly bad genetics okay so

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.479

again most people their potential for

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.099 
again most people their potential for
muscle<00:03:18.850> growth<00:03:19.030> or<00:03:19.329> how<00:03:19.420> much<00:03:19.600> muscle<00:03:19.900> they

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
muscle growth or how much muscle they

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.310 
muscle growth or how much muscle they
put<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.820> at<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.880> rate<00:03:22.390> they<00:03:22.570> put<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.019> is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
put on at the rate they put it on is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.160 
put on at the rate they put it on is
about<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.160> same<00:03:24.459> all<00:03:25.269> right<00:03:25.480> what's<00:03:25.810> going<00:03:26.140> to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
about the same all right what's going to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.099 
about the same all right what's going to
be<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.250> big<00:03:27.549> difference<00:03:27.579> is<00:03:28.299> what<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:28.870> going

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
be the big difference is what it's going

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.740 
be the big difference is what it's going
to<00:03:29.200> look<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.730> okay<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.209> two<00:03:31.480> things

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
to look like okay we can do two things

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.229 
to look like okay we can do two things
two<00:03:31.959> muscle<00:03:32.319> we<00:03:32.920> can<00:03:33.069> make<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> grow<00:03:33.549> or<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.090> can

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
two muscle we can make it grow or we can

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.550 
two muscle we can make it grow or we can
make<00:03:34.359> it<00:03:34.510> shrink<00:03:34.720> or<00:03:34.870> obviously<00:03:35.319> we<00:03:35.440> can

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
make it shrink or obviously we can

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.380 
make it shrink or obviously we can
maintain<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.340> guess<00:03:36.579> three<00:03:36.850> things<00:03:37.120> but

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
maintain it so I guess three things but

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.270 
maintain it so I guess three things but
for<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.840> most<00:03:37.930> part<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.410> can<00:03:38.560> make<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.890> muscle

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
for the most part we can make the muscle

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.800 
for the most part we can make the muscle
grow<00:03:39.690> get<00:03:40.690> bigger<00:03:40.930> or<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.420> make<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.569> shrink

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
grow get bigger or we can make it shrink

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.030 
grow get bigger or we can make it shrink
or<00:03:43.989> maintain<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.650> okay<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> here's<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.709> cool

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
or maintain it okay so here's a cool

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.590 
or maintain it okay so here's a cool
trick<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.459> want<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.700> show<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.940> when<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.480> talk

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
trick I want to show you when I talk

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.599 
trick I want to show you when I talk
about<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.380> length<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.920> muscle<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.489> its

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
about the length of the muscle and its

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.039 
about the length of the muscle and its
potential<00:03:52.000> for<00:03:52.329> growth<00:03:52.510> here's<00:03:52.810> what<00:03:52.959> I'm

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
potential for growth here's what I'm

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:53.670 
potential for growth here's what I'm
talking<00:03:53.410> about

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
talking about

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.039 
talking about
if<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.069> go<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> gym<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:55.630> look<00:03:55.840> at<00:03:55.930> guys

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
if you go to the gym you look at guys

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.930 
if you go to the gym you look at guys
with<00:03:56.319> skinny<00:03:56.650> calves<00:03:56.980> what<00:03:57.639> are<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.819> gonna

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
with skinny calves what are you gonna

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.610 
with skinny calves what are you gonna
notice<00:03:58.420> you're<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.230> notice<00:03:59.410> that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
notice you're going to notice that

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.559 
notice you're going to notice that
typically<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.489> guy<00:04:00.609> with<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.940> skinny<00:04:01.269> calves

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
typically the guy with the skinny calves

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.780 
typically the guy with the skinny calves
don't<00:04:02.380> necessarily<00:04:03.040> have<00:04:03.220> small<00:04:03.549> legs

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
don't necessarily have small legs

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.270 
don't necessarily have small legs
although<00:04:04.090> they<00:04:04.269> could<00:04:04.859> but<00:04:05.859> what<00:04:06.069> they<00:04:06.220> do

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
although they could but what they do

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.759 
although they could but what they do
have<00:04:06.730> in<00:04:06.940> common<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.440> calf

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
have in common is that the calf

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.699 
have in common is that the calf
insertion<00:04:09.579> is<00:04:09.760> high<00:04:10.090> on<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.989> leg<00:04:11.200> right<00:04:11.500> so

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
insertion is high on the leg right so

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.199 
insertion is high on the leg right so
the<00:04:12.010> space<00:04:12.340> between<00:04:12.639> the<00:04:13.569> heel<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.970> calf

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the space between the heel and the calf

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.979 
the space between the heel and the calf
muscle<00:04:16.780> where<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.410> starts<00:04:17.859> is<00:04:18.010> long<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.239> guys

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
muscle where it starts is long and guys

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.820 
muscle where it starts is long and guys
with<00:04:20.440> bigger<00:04:21.220> calves<00:04:21.720> typically<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.320> space

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
with bigger calves typically that space

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.540 
with bigger calves typically that space
is<00:04:24.099> a

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
is a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.939 
is a
smaller<00:04:25.060> thus<00:04:25.810> they<00:04:26.080> have<00:04:26.110> more<00:04:26.560> potential

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
smaller thus they have more potential

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.100 
smaller thus they have more potential
for<00:04:27.220> growth<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.490> either<00:04:27.970> genetically<00:04:28.750> they

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
for growth so either genetically they

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.379 
for growth so either genetically they
have<00:04:29.289> bigger<00:04:29.560> calves<00:04:29.919> or<00:04:30.280> genetically<00:04:30.940> they

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
have bigger calves or genetically they

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.559 
have bigger calves or genetically they
have<00:04:31.629> more<00:04:32.169> potential<00:04:32.770> for<00:04:33.009> growth<00:04:33.419> all<00:04:34.419> right

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
have more potential for growth all right

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.689 
have more potential for growth all right
same<00:04:34.840> thing<00:04:34.870> happens<00:04:35.379> with<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.560> biceps<00:04:36.129> and<00:04:36.310> I

and<00:04:50.860> you're<00:04:51.370> gonna<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.759> space<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:52.690> now

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
and you're gonna see a space here now

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.070 
and you're gonna see a space here now
some<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.770> guys<00:04:53.949> will<00:04:54.940> see<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.659> tiny

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
some of you guys will see a very tiny

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.439 
some of you guys will see a very tiny
space<00:04:56.560> where<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.889> could<00:04:57.039> only<00:04:57.069> fit<00:04:57.610> about<00:04:57.729> one

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
space where you could only fit about one

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.749 
space where you could only fit about one
finger<00:04:58.750> between<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.259> bicep<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.310> tendon

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
finger between the bicep and the tendon

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.700 
finger between the bicep and the tendon
okay<00:05:01.719> that<00:05:02.020> means<00:05:02.259> you<00:05:02.919> have<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.460> long

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
okay that means you have a long

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.499 
okay that means you have a long
insertion<00:05:05.710> or<00:05:05.889> a<00:05:05.949> long<00:05:06.250> muscle<00:05:06.729> head<00:05:06.909> right

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
insertion or a long muscle head right

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.510 
insertion or a long muscle head right
the<00:05:07.659> insertion<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.319> lower<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:08.949> you<00:05:08.979> have<00:05:09.280> more

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the insertion is lower so you have more

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.110 
the insertion is lower so you have more
potential<00:05:09.940> for<00:05:10.690> growth<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:11.289> your<00:05:11.620> biceps<00:05:12.280> okay

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
potential for growth in your biceps okay

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.350 
potential for growth in your biceps okay
a<00:05:13.150> guy<00:05:13.449> like<00:05:13.659> me<00:05:14.520> horrible

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
a guy like me horrible

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.129 
a guy like me horrible
bicep<00:05:17.110> genetics<00:05:17.590> right<00:05:18.159> I<00:05:18.460> could<00:05:19.270> fit<00:05:19.479> about<00:05:19.719> 3

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
bicep genetics right I could fit about 3

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.790 
bicep genetics right I could fit about 3
fingers<00:05:20.879> between<00:05:21.879> the<00:05:22.120> bicep<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.289> tendon

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.110 
fingers between the bicep and the tendon
all<00:05:24.430> right

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
all right

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.959 
all right
usually<00:05:26.110> somebody<00:05:27.009> who<00:05:27.310> can<00:05:27.490> fit<00:05:27.699> two<00:05:27.940> fingers

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
usually somebody who can fit two fingers

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.439 
usually somebody who can fit two fingers
is<00:05:28.659> already<00:05:29.349> you<00:05:30.039> know<00:05:30.159> not<00:05:30.520> great<00:05:30.909> in<00:05:31.120> terms

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
is already you know not great in terms

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.480 
is already you know not great in terms
of<00:05:31.690> building<00:05:31.960> muscle<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.770> their<00:05:32.889> biceps<00:05:33.340> so

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
of building muscle for their biceps so

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.670 
of building muscle for their biceps so
you<00:05:33.610> get<00:05:33.759> when<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.060> can<00:05:34.210> fit<00:05:34.419> 3<00:05:34.719> fingers<00:05:35.169> then

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
you get when you can fit 3 fingers then

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.950 
you get when you can fit 3 fingers then
your<00:05:35.860> biceps<00:05:36.400> they<00:05:37.029> don't<00:05:37.240> have<00:05:37.449> that<00:05:37.690> much

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
your biceps they don't have that much

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.620 
your biceps they don't have that much
potential<00:05:38.460> right<00:05:39.460> in<00:05:39.639> terms<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.240> what<00:05:40.479> they're

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
potential right in terms of what they're

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.930 
potential right in terms of what they're
gonna<00:05:40.750> look<00:05:40.900> like<00:05:41.319> now<00:05:41.529> you<00:05:41.590> can<00:05:41.949> still<00:05:42.279> build

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
gonna look like now you can still build

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.990 
gonna look like now you can still build
your<00:05:43.479> biceps<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.319> should<00:05:44.560> still<00:05:44.889> train<00:05:45.639> your

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
your biceps you should still train your

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320 
your biceps you should still train your
biceps<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.750> fact<00:05:47.110> if<00:05:47.500> you<00:05:47.949> have<00:05:48.190> bad<00:05:48.610> bicep

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
biceps in fact if you have bad bicep

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.620 
biceps in fact if you have bad bicep
genetics<00:05:49.930> then<00:05:50.919> this<00:05:51.190> should<00:05:51.430> be<00:05:51.639> more<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.449> a

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
genetics then this should be more of a

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.339 
genetics then this should be more of a
reason<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:53.620> train<00:05:54.009> them<00:05:54.250> harder<00:05:54.849> not<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.900> deter

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
reason to train them harder not to deter

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.499 
reason to train them harder not to deter
you<00:05:56.590> from<00:05:56.620> training<00:05:57.159> them<00:05:57.430> at<00:05:57.580> all<00:05:57.759> right

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
you from training them at all right

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.480 
you from training them at all right
because<00:05:58.810> we<00:05:58.930> want<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.229> bring<00:05:59.500> these<00:05:59.949> muscle

can't<00:06:41.169> what<00:06:41.770> you<00:06:41.889> can<00:06:42.130> do<00:06:42.370> is<00:06:42.790> train<00:06:43.150> your

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
can't what you can do is train your

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.510 
can't what you can do is train your
chest<00:06:43.630> as<00:06:43.840> best<00:06:44.080> possible<00:06:44.710> and<00:06:44.860> hypertrophy

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
chest as best possible and hypertrophy

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.670 
chest as best possible and hypertrophy
the<00:06:45.910> chest<00:06:46.180> is<00:06:46.330> best<00:06:46.570> possible<00:06:47.139> and<00:06:47.410> whatever

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
the chest is best possible and whatever

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.610 
the chest is best possible and whatever
outcome<00:06:48.070> you<00:06:48.460> get<00:06:48.729> is<00:06:49.690> still<00:06:49.990> going<00:06:50.289> to<00:06:50.440> be

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
outcome you get is still going to be

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.060 
outcome you get is still going to be
better<00:06:50.860> than<00:06:51.190> the<00:06:51.430> starting<00:06:51.880> point<00:06:52.210> all<00:06:52.900> right

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
better than the starting point all right

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.189 
better than the starting point all right
so<00:06:54.070> the<00:06:54.400> point<00:06:54.610> of<00:06:54.880> this<00:06:55.000> video<00:06:55.240> really<00:06:55.750> is<00:06:55.960> not

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
so the point of this video really is not

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.810 
so the point of this video really is not
to<00:06:56.440> tell<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:56.830> that<00:06:57.280> you<00:06:57.400> have<00:06:57.550> shitty

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
to tell you that you have shitty

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.490 
to tell you that you have shitty
genetics<00:06:58.360> or<00:06:58.600> that<00:06:58.750> someone<00:06:58.960> has<00:06:59.229> better

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
genetics or that someone has better

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.409 
genetics or that someone has better
genetics<00:06:59.979> than<00:07:00.160> you<00:07:00.280> or<00:07:00.759> that<00:07:00.940> you<00:07:01.060> have<00:07:01.180> great

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
genetics than you or that you have great

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.029 
genetics than you or that you have great
genetics<00:07:01.930> and<00:07:02.020> you<00:07:02.169> have<00:07:02.289> better<00:07:02.560> genetics

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
genetics and you have better genetics

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.749 
genetics and you have better genetics
