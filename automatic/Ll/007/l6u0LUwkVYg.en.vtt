making<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> cheapest

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
making it one of the cheapest

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
making it one of the cheapest
two-by-twos<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> market<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
two-by-twos on the market the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.849 
two-by-twos on the market the
stickerless<00:00:24.750> shades<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.289> pretty<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
stickerless shades are pretty much the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
stickerless shades are pretty much the
same<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.189> half<00:00:26.400> Brides<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:26.849> cube<00:00:27.210> Smith

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
same as half Brides from cube Smith

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
same as half Brides from cube Smith
overall<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> shades<00:00:28.680> aren't<00:00:28.890> horrible<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
overall the shades aren't horrible but I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.679 
overall the shades aren't horrible but I
have<00:00:29.820> had<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.210> trouble<00:00:30.539> distinguishing

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
have had some trouble distinguishing

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
have had some trouble distinguishing
between<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> orange<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> red<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
between the orange and the red and I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.190 
between the orange and the red and I
really<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> orange<00:00:33.899> in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
really just don't like the orange in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
really just don't like the orange in
general<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.190> yellow<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:35.790> pretty

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
general the yellow is also pretty

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.490 
general the yellow is also pretty
extreme<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> wish<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> cube<00:00:37.350> had

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
extreme and I wish that the cube had

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.660 
extreme and I wish that the cube had
more<00:00:37.739> normal<00:00:38.160> shades

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
more normal shades

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
more normal shades
despite<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> cubes<00:00:39.870> low<00:00:40.110> price<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
despite the cubes low price the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 
despite the cubes low price the
performance<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> spectacular<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
performance is spectacular and up to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
performance is spectacular and up to
standards<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.440> by<00:00:43.620> twos<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
standards with other two by twos the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.220 
standards with other two by twos the
turning<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.820> moderately<00:00:45.239> fast<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> smooth

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
turning is moderately fast with a smooth

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
turning is moderately fast with a smooth
but<00:00:46.500> slightly<00:00:46.770> crispy<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> crunchy<00:00:47.910> field<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but slightly crispy and crunchy field I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
but slightly crispy and crunchy field I
think<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> cube<00:00:49.500> could<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> little

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think that the cube could be a little

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.590 
think that the cube could be a little
bit<00:00:50.219> faster<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> haven't<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.360> noticed

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
bit faster but I haven't really noticed

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
bit faster but I haven't really noticed
it<00:00:51.870> during<00:00:52.020> Sol's<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.610> most<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it during Sol's as with most of the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.459 
it during Sol's as with most of the
two-by-twos<00:00:54.660> corner-cutting<00:00:55.199> as

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
two-by-twos corner-cutting as

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.010 
two-by-twos corner-cutting as
effortlessly<00:00:55.949> 45<00:00:56.520> degrees<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.510> cut<00:00:57.750> past

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
effortlessly 45 degrees and can cut past

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
effortlessly 45 degrees and can cut past
with<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.260> effort<00:00:58.680> while<00:00:59.340> reverses<00:00:59.879> easily<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
with some effort while reverses easily a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.959 
with some effort while reverses easily a
quarter<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> piece<00:01:01.289> lock<00:01:02.160> ups<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.609> alright

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
quarter of a piece lock ups are alright

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.149 
quarter of a piece lock ups are alright
on<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.359> cube<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.439> catchy<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.040> it's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
on this cube it's a bit catchy but it's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429 
on this cube it's a bit catchy but it's
not<00:01:05.369> enough<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.119> mess<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.900> also

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
not enough to really mess you up I also

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.840 
not enough to really mess you up I also
haven't<00:01:07.680> had<00:01:07.860> any<00:01:08.010> pops<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.610> cube

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
haven't had any pops on this cube

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
haven't had any pops on this cube
because<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> mechanism<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.500> very

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
because of the mechanism it's very

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
because of the mechanism it's very
similar<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> fangshi<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> lingpo<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
similar to the fangshi in the lingpo the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
similar to the fangshi in the lingpo the
large<00:01:13.170> corner<00:01:13.530> bases<00:01:13.890> prevent<00:01:14.220> any<00:01:14.400> popping

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
large corner bases prevent any popping

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
large corner bases prevent any popping
the<00:01:15.450> alignment<00:01:15.869> mechanism<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.740> much

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the alignment mechanism is pretty much

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
the alignment mechanism is pretty much
the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> v<00:01:17.700> cube<00:01:18.000> -<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.600> pretty

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the same as the v cube - and it's pretty

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
the same as the v cube - and it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.950> far<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.280> assembling

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
self-explanatory as far as assembling

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
self-explanatory as far as assembling
just<00:01:21.600> note<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> assembling<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.530> cube<00:01:22.799> can

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
just note that assembling this cube can

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.460 
just note that assembling this cube can
be<00:01:23.100> very<00:01:23.610> challenging<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.350> any

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
be very challenging so are there any

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.289 
be very challenging so are there any
problems<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.130> cube<00:01:26.400> well<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.180> are

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
problems with this cube well there are

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
problems with this cube well there are
two<00:01:27.570> substantial<00:01:28.170> problems<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
two substantial problems with this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
two substantial problems with this
puzzle<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.869> Stickle

puzzle the first is that it is Stickle

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
puzzle the first is that it is Stickle
is<00:01:31.350> normally<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> Stickles<00:01:32.850> cube<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> also<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
is normally a Stickles cube can also be

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
is normally a Stickles cube can also be
bought<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> black<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.439> white<00:01:34.470> plastic<00:01:35.130> but

bought in black or white plastic but
that<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> case<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> cube<00:01:36.990> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that is not the case with this cube this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
that is not the case with this cube this
means<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> anybody<00:01:38.220> who<00:01:38.490> may<00:01:38.670> wish<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.060> use

couldn't compete with it this may not be
as<00:01:43.200> big<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.619> problem<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.159> people<00:01:44.310> who<00:01:44.549> live

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
as big of a problem for people who live

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
as big of a problem for people who live
in<00:01:44.880> areas<00:01:45.090> where<00:01:45.390> competitions<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.140> scarce

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
in areas where competitions are scarce

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
in areas where competitions are scarce
or<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:47.220> who<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> compete<00:01:48.149> but

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
or people who don't want to compete but

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
or people who don't want to compete but
if<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> person<00:01:49.229> ever<00:01:49.380> did<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
if that person ever did get to go to a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.679 
if that person ever did get to go to a
competition<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> use<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
competition they would have to use a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
competition they would have to use a
different<00:01:51.840> cube<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.979> second<00:01:53.310> problem<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
different cube the second problem is the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.969 
different cube the second problem is the
plastic<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.509> feels<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.259> cheap<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
plastic it feels very cheap which is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
plastic it feels very cheap which is
most<00:01:56.159> likely<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> case<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.030> only<00:01:57.180> four

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
most likely the case if it's only four

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
most likely the case if it's only four
dollars<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:58.770> feel<00:01:58.829> brittle<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
dollars it doesn't feel brittle like I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
dollars it doesn't feel brittle like I
could<00:01:59.729> snap<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.689> almost<00:02:00.780> feels<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.170> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
could snap but it almost feels like I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800 
could snap but it almost feels like I
could<00:02:01.409> Bend<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> pieces<00:02:02.280> are<00:02:02.490> forced<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
could Bend if the pieces are forced so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
could Bend if the pieces are forced so
overall<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.409> would<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.740> recommend<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
overall I would not recommend the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
overall I would not recommend the
cyclone<00:02:05.700> boys<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> buy<00:02:06.210> -<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.570> speed<00:02:06.869> cubers

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
cyclone boys to buy - to speed cubers

cyclone boys to buy - to speed cubers
cubes<00:02:08.250> performance<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.879> excellent<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.599> since

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
cubes performance is excellent but since

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
cubes performance is excellent but since
it<00:02:09.929> only<00:02:10.110> comes<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.500> stickerless<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.099> speed

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it only comes in stickerless a speed

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
it only comes in stickerless a speed
cuber<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:11.849> not<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.120> any<00:02:12.270> use<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
cuber would not have any use for this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.229 
cuber would not have any use for this
however<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.040> you're<00:02:14.190> looking<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.730> cheap<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
however if you're looking for cheap to

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.240 
however if you're looking for cheap to
buy<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> mess<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.770> cube<00:02:17.069> may

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
buy to just to mess with this cube may

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.729 
buy to just to mess with this cube may
be<00:02:17.310> worth<00:02:17.580> checking<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.239> some<00:02:19.140> overall<00:02:19.530> grade

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
be worth checking out some overall grade

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.830 
be worth checking out some overall grade
on<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.980> cube<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> B<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.270> performance<00:02:21.720> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
on this cube is a B the performance is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.330 
on this cube is a B the performance is
outstanding<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.709> could<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.099> lot<00:02:23.310> of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
outstanding and could be a lot of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.040 
outstanding and could be a lot of
people's<00:02:23.640> mains<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.360> came<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.660> black<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
people's mains if it came in black and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.400 
people's mains if it came in black and
white

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
white

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.080 
white
the<00:02:25.980> only<00:02:26.099> other<00:02:26.250> problem<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> cheap

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the only other problem is the cheap

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.790 
the only other problem is the cheap
plastic<00:02:27.239> which<00:02:27.959> doesn't<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.470> affect

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
plastic which doesn't really affect

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.510 
plastic which doesn't really affect
performance

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
performance

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.460

I<00:02:29.550> really<00:02:30.239> wish<00:02:30.390> cyclone<00:02:30.840> boys<00:02:31.019> would<00:02:31.290> just

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I really wish cyclone boys would just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.050 
I really wish cyclone boys would just
produce<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.069> their<00:02:32.250> cubes<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.670> black<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
produce all of their cubes in black and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
produce all of their cubes in black and
white<00:02:33.180> since<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.900> version<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.319> their<00:02:34.470> three

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
white since one version of their three

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.589 
white since one version of their three
by<00:02:34.769> threes<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> therefore<00:02:35.580> offer<00:02:35.880> also<00:02:36.120> only

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
by threes and therefore offer also only

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.610 
by threes and therefore offer also only
come<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.930> stick<00:02:37.140> ballast

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
come and stick ballast

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.440 
come and stick ballast
however<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.489> hard<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> complain<00:02:39.030> about<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
however it's hard to complain about a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
however it's hard to complain about a
four<00:02:39.750> dollar<00:02:39.900> two<00:02:40.170> by<00:02:40.349> two<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.160> would<00:02:41.280> like
