00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.480 
carefully but the subject of qi going
you<00:04:23.470> really<00:04:23.680> want<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.949> study<00:04:24.070> with<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.310> good

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
you really want to study with a good

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.040 
you really want to study with a good
master<00:04:24.880> that's<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.240> most<00:04:25.389> important<00:04:25.900> thing

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
master that's the most important thing

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
master that's the most important thing
because<00:04:26.169> people<00:04:26.560> who<00:04:26.620> don't<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
because people who don't have the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.129 
because people who don't have the
education<00:04:27.240> sometimes<00:04:28.240> they<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.870> make

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
education sometimes they just make

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.360 
education sometimes they just make
mistakes<00:04:29.590> not<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.190> they're

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
mistakes not because they're

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.950 
mistakes not because they're
deliberately<00:04:30.789> hurting<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.270> student<00:04:31.600> but

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
deliberately hurting a student but

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.360 
deliberately hurting a student but
because<00:04:32.199> they<00:04:32.350> simply<00:04:32.560> don't<00:04:32.889> know<00:04:33.160> any

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
because they simply don't know any

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.279 
because they simply don't know any
better<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.449> it's<00:04:34.570> an<00:04:34.660> important<00:04:35.020> point<00:04:35.139> to

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
better and so it's an important point to

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.230 
better and so it's an important point to
consider<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:36.340> name<00:04:36.550> of<00:04:36.729> your<00:04:36.880> book<00:04:37.060> again

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
consider the name of your book again

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.500 
consider the name of your book again
it's<00:04:38.139> opening<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:39.130> energy<00:04:39.729> gates<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.240> your

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
it's opening the energy gates of your

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.020 
it's opening the energy gates of your
