00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 of that population 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.510
 all welcome to so many tourists today 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.520
 I bring you a video that has everything 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.390
 a little the tutorial of this makeup 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.920
 a seen between the pine on July 4 that 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.650
 will happen who do not have us 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.450
 dependence the football world cup with the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.460
 makeup features be by 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.169
 the colors that you use is that for this 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.970
 little detail that I did here I have a 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.220
 star also I will be giving 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.860
 an idea outfit a little bit to three lives 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.899
 but ideal fun to go see the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.579
 football game and I was thinking that 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.769
 This makeup can be adapted and 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.019
 use the colors of the flag of 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.800
 country that you support does not get me any further 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.800
 with the introduction 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.520
 The first thing is to moisturize the lips to 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.020
 prepare them for a dark lipstick 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.000
 I start the makeup of the eyes 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.680
 placing a creamy pencil that goes to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.450
 make the shadows last longer 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.019
 time and it will intensify the colors 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.359
 of newer cattle 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.270
 I'm going to use three shades of blue 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.939
 light medium and dark I place the color 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.399
 clear on the first part of the eyelid and 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.799
 the middle blue in the center of the eyelid 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.909
 climbing slightly above the clearing 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.909
 to make the transition 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.990
 and finally the dark floor to give 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.990
 depth and tear the eye 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.560
 / color and color I clean my finger and for 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.630
 last I will take the target to 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.760
 illuminate and integrate makeup up 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.040
 the eyebrows are going to make the outline 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.140
 of the eye and I will use a black pencil 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.590
 It is important that you have the sharp tip 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.600
 to get a fine stroke start of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.760
 half of the backwards little bit to 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.740
 little to be curious was 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.810
 making small strokes and I'm leaving 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.700
 approaching the initial part of the eyelid 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.250
 which is more comfortable for me to leave 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.929
 end try and see now with a 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.670
 Finite brush I'm going to blur 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 slightly the stroke and this is going to help 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.390
 to make the outline look softer and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.070
 no imperfections now I'm going to touch up 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.840
 the eyebrows is very important to give a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.510
 pretty shape because they are the ones 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.930
 mark the eyes and again the tip of the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.180
 pencil has to be sharp I'm going to 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.990
 blur the stroke so there are more 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.990
 soft and natural 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.980
 floor lashes and abundant masks and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.080
 we look at the world I will place a pencil 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 blue on the water line but they can 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 put black or white also a moment 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.450
 of the red blush combined with the labial 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.450
 it will be red too 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.160
 this part is optional I decided to add 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.810
 a white star because it's a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.940
 makeup theme for the world cup 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.069
 football supporting the team of states 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.490
 united and also celebrating the day of the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.130
 independence than patriot and today another 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.920
 once sharp pencil and white shadow 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.910
 to seal well the star will last us 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 all day 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.330
 I'm going to stick a red star of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.140
 those that sell to make nail arts 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.280
 and placed it in the center equal to this 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.280
 it would be the final result 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.959
 let's go to the hair I make a tall bun 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.270
 and today I'm going to use this hair monkey 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.250
 synthetic that I leave carmen and the 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.380
 will know in the next video I decided 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.989
 invite her to the channel so they know her 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.480
 because she does a very nice job 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.790
 and it's the sewing wigs extensions of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.290
 setra and the areas sick people 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.810
 but we'll talk more in the next 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.630
 video for lovers of the look girl 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.030
 and pin up can add a red handkerchief 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.459
 or a headband like this that brings a bow 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.280
 of gifts here my girlfriend is 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.280
 asking what I laugh about minimum 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.359
 and let's start with the feet if you're one of the 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.330
 who prefer to be comfortable a couple of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.220
 tennis and these bring sequins so 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.140
 we go in tennis but without losing the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.140
 glamor speaks nothing 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.540
 to the court in jeans vest in jeans and 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.170
 long white blouse behind to disguise 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.170
 The tail 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.550
 to those who can not give up the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.820
 high heel shoes 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.920
 these are precious the evolution of the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.280
 sandal slavia dor that now bring 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.280
 heel 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.750
 and this is a different proposal 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.070
 fun to go out with friends to 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.100

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.480
 preference in my case and you 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.150
