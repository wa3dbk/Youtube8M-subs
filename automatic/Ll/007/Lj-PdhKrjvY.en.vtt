favorites<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.400> well<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.900> think

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
favorites as well and actually i think

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
favorites as well and actually i think
it<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.799> Daniel<00:01:41.070> Duke<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.150> left<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> other

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it was Daniel Duke that left the other

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
it was Daniel Duke that left the other
week<00:01:42.810> he<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.590> amazing<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
week he was amazing but I think the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719 
week he was amazing but I think the
catch<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.540> favorite<00:01:45.930> Sasha<00:01:46.729> but

catch is one of my favorite Sasha but

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
catch is one of my favorite Sasha but
there<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.149> too<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.509> stood<00:01:48.869> out

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
there that there too i think stood out
