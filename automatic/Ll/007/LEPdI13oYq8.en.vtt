00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
strangely enough these batteries

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.180 
strangely enough these batteries
normally<00:02:18.940> may<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.000> well<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.360> welded<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
normally may as well be welded in to the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.949 
normally may as well be welded in to the
iPhone<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.120> difficult<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.629> get<00:02:23.780> out

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
iPhone they are so difficult to get out

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.920 
iPhone they are so difficult to get out
but<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:25.360> doesn't<00:02:26.360> feel<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.629> it's<00:02:26.810> got

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
but so this doesn't feel like it's got

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.780 
but so this doesn't feel like it's got
any<00:02:27.049> adhesive<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.739> all<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.760> a

any adhesive on it it's all there is a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.869 
any adhesive on it it's all there is a
stickiness<00:02:32.209> there<00:02:32.950> whether<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.280> moisture<00:02:34.819> in

stickiness there whether the moisture in

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.270 
stickiness there whether the moisture in
some<00:02:35.120> Wayne<00:02:35.329> has<00:02:35.659> caused<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.620> are<00:02:36.860> anything

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
going to do next is get the battery out

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.920 
going to do next is get the battery out
and<00:02:42.200> try<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.120> powered<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.480> without<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
get the camera to focus on a little bit

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.319 
get the camera to focus on a little bit
better<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:56.390> next<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.629> my<00:02:56.780> fingernail<00:02:57.650> there

better just next to my fingernail there
some<00:02:59.329> sort<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.629> dried-up<00:02:59.959> signs<00:03:00.379> of<00:03:00.500> moisture

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
some sort of dried-up signs of moisture

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
some sort of dried-up signs of moisture
on<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.150> connector<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.930> there's<00:03:03.409> quite<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
on the connector also there's quite a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.949 
on the connector also there's quite a
bit<00:03:03.859> more<00:03:04.780> down<00:03:05.780> here<00:03:07.599> obviously<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.750> has

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
bit more down here obviously that has

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.899 
bit more down here obviously that has
dried<00:03:09.260> up<00:03:09.290> now<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:09.859> there<00:03:10.010> are<00:03:10.129> signs<00:03:10.609> that

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
dried up now but there are signs that

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.649 
dried up now but there are signs that
water<00:03:11.690> has<00:03:12.170> been<00:03:12.379> there<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.120> say<00:03:14.329> next

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
water has been there but like I say next

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.740 
water has been there but like I say next
what<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.049> want<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.590> do<00:03:15.739> is<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:17.510> try<00:03:17.690> to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
what I want to do is just to try to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.789 
what I want to do is just to try to
power<00:03:18.079> it<00:03:18.319> without<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:20.329> battery<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.200> the

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
power it without the battery in the

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.909 
power it without the battery in the
reason<00:03:22.069> for<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.930> could<00:03:24.109> be<00:03:24.319> just<00:03:24.709> the

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
reason for this is it could be just the

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.059 
reason for this is it could be just the
power<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:26.269> another<00:03:26.480> power<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.069> battery

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
power so another power the battery

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.330 
power so another power the battery
that's<00:03:28.669> been<00:03:29.419> given<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> knock<00:03:30.280> sort<00:03:31.280> of

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that's been given the knock sort of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.619 
that's been given the knock sort of
power<00:03:31.489> wise<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.870> isn't<00:03:33.819> really<00:03:34.819> except

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
power wise and it's isn't really except

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.960 
power wise and it's isn't really except
in<00:03:35.750> charge<00:03:35.959> anymore<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:37.220> might<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.609> unable<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
in charge anymore it might be unable to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.970 
in charge anymore it might be unable to
because<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.510> water<00:03:38.720> damaged<00:03:39.109> so<00:03:39.379> that's<00:03:39.829> why

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
because the water damaged so that's why

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.039 
because the water damaged so that's why
I<00:03:40.040> always<00:03:40.099> try<00:03:40.639> first<00:03:40.940> with<00:03:41.239> water<00:03:41.690> damage

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
I always try first with water damage

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.220 
I always try first with water damage
cases<00:03:42.410> especially<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:43.220> iPhone<00:03:44.209> 4s<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.109> we'll

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
cases especially in iPhone 4s so we'll

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.629 
cases especially in iPhone 4s so we'll
be<00:03:45.349> testing<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.739> now<00:03:45.980> what<00:03:46.129> we've<00:03:46.250> got<00:03:46.280> here

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
be testing that now what we've got here

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.830 
be testing that now what we've got here
is<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.590> iPhone<00:03:48.590> connected<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
is the iPhone connected to just a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.640 
is the iPhone connected to just a
computer<00:03:51.169> with<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.530> cable<00:03:52.510> there<00:03:53.510> are<00:03:53.690> signs<00:03:54.379> of

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
computer with a cable there are signs of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.390 
computer with a cable there are signs of
activity<00:03:54.949> there<00:03:56.379> now<00:03:57.379> and<00:03:57.500> again<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:57.799> did<00:03:58.160> have

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
activity there now and again I did have

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.490 
activity there now and again I did have
the<00:03:58.639> charger<00:03:59.329> connected<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.870> did<00:04:00.049> come<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the charger connected it did come on the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.860 
the charger connected it did come on the
went<00:04:00.680> straight<00:04:00.949> up<00:04:01.160> again<00:04:01.459> for<00:04:02.389> some<00:04:02.540> reason

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
went straight up again for some reason

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.349 
went straight up again for some reason
this<00:04:02.989> seems<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.440> prove<00:04:03.699> be<00:04:04.699> proven<00:04:05.060> mobile

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
this seems to prove be proven mobile

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.420 
this seems to prove be proven mobile
like<00:04:05.510> reliable<00:04:06.079> there<00:04:06.260> we<00:04:06.379> go<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.799> might<00:04:07.040> be

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
like reliable there we go it might be

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.240 
like reliable there we go it might be
just<00:04:07.760> because<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.449> connector<00:04:09.190> on<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
just because the connector on the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.539 
just because the connector on the
charger<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.959> maybe<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.440> little<00:04:12.709> loose<00:04:13.160> for<00:04:13.400> some

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
charger is maybe a little loose for some

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.349 
charger is maybe a little loose for some
reason<00:04:16.630> we've<00:04:17.630> got<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.900> trying<00:04:18.199> to<00:04:18.440> switch<00:04:18.799> on

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
reason we've got it trying to switch on

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.540 
reason we've got it trying to switch on
so<00:04:20.359> as<00:04:20.419> far<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.780> screen<00:04:21.169> goes<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.769> LCD<00:04:22.400> at

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
so as far as the screen goes the LCD at

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.870 
so as far as the screen goes the LCD at
least<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.510> looks<00:04:23.690> okay<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.229> looks<00:04:24.320> fine

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
least that looks okay that looks fine

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.330 
least that looks okay that looks fine
but<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.479> not<00:04:26.600> switching<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.139> or<00:04:27.410> staying<00:04:28.070> on

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
but it's not switching on or staying on

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.550 
but it's not switching on or staying on
reliably<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.889> what<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.070> want<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.370> do<00:04:31.490> now<00:04:31.789> is

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
reliably so what I want to do now is

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.749 
reliably so what I want to do now is
disconnect<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:36.139> assembly<00:04:37.070> here<00:04:37.100> that

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
disconnect this assembly here that

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.659 
disconnect this assembly here that
connector<00:04:38.360> is<00:04:38.690> what<00:04:39.620> comes<00:04:39.889> from<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.370> dock

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
connector is what comes from the dock

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.020 
connector is what comes from the dock
connector<00:04:41.270> here<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:42.070> want<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.130> do<00:04:43.250> that's<00:04:43.460> then

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
connector here I want to do that's then

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.320 
connector here I want to do that's then
put<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.900> battery<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.039> see<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.639> brand<00:04:47.240> new

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
put a battery in it to see a brand new

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.300 
put a battery in it to see a brand new
battery<00:04:47.539> should<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:48.080> say<00:04:48.259> to<00:04:48.710> see<00:04:48.889> if<00:04:49.100> it'll

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
battery should I say to see if it'll

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.029 
battery should I say to see if it'll
stay<00:04:49.520> on<00:04:50.139> from<00:04:51.139> just<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.860> battery<00:04:52.250> power

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
stay on from just on battery power

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.740 
stay on from just on battery power
yeah<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.190> say<00:04:55.310> feel<00:04:55.520> sterilized<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.479> old

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
yeah to say feel sterilized is the old

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.540 
yeah to say feel sterilized is the old
battery<00:04:57.259> that's<00:04:57.440> been<00:04:57.620> taken<00:04:57.979> out<00:04:58.099> this<00:04:58.340> is<00:04:58.520> a

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
battery that's been taken out this is a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.900 
battery that's been taken out this is a
brand<00:04:58.910> new<00:04:59.000> one<00:04:59.330> disconnected<00:05:00.289> this

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
brand new one disconnected this

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.610 
brand new one disconnected this
connection<00:05:01.910> that<00:05:02.000> goes<00:05:02.150> down<00:05:02.419> to<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.660> dock<00:05:02.960> so

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
connection that goes down to the dock so

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.210 
connection that goes down to the dock so
if<00:05:03.919> purely<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.580> working<00:05:05.240> on<00:05:05.419> only<00:05:06.220> battery

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
if purely is working on only battery

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.939 
if purely is working on only battery
power<00:05:07.430> if<00:05:07.849> it's<00:05:08.090> going<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.389> switch<00:05:08.599> on<00:05:10.630> okay

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
power if it's going to switch on okay

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.499 
power if it's going to switch on okay
right<00:05:12.949> purely<00:05:13.310> working<00:05:13.580> from<00:05:13.729> battery<00:05:14.090> power

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
right purely working from battery power

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.110 
right purely working from battery power
although<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.840> Apple<00:05:15.110> symbolize<00:05:15.560> before<00:05:16.120> when

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
although the Apple symbolize before when

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.390 
although the Apple symbolize before when
it<00:05:17.150> was<00:05:17.270> only<00:05:17.570> coming<00:05:17.990> from<00:05:18.320> mains<00:05:19.070> power

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it was only coming from mains power

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.230 
it was only coming from mains power
through<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.479> dark<00:05:20.660> connector<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.940> quite

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
through the dark connector and quite

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.480 
through the dark connector and quite
happily<00:05:23.570> say<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.919> this<00:05:25.039> has<00:05:25.160> been<00:05:25.280> on<00:05:25.430> for

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
happily say that this has been on for

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.409 
happily say that this has been on for
longer<00:05:25.910> now<00:05:26.090> than<00:05:26.800> what<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.949> was<00:05:28.300> when<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.330> was

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
longer now than what it was when it was

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.820 
longer now than what it was when it was
only<00:05:29.830> through<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:30.889> dock<00:05:32.380> still<00:05:33.380> staying<00:05:33.650> on

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
only through the dock still staying on

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.779 
only through the dock still staying on
so<00:05:34.039> that's<00:05:34.159> good<00:05:36.130> gotta<00:05:37.130> say<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.310> do<00:05:37.400> have<00:05:37.669> to<00:05:37.760> be

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
so that's good gotta say I do have to be

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.450 
so that's good gotta say I do have to be
careful<00:05:38.409> with<00:05:39.409> why<00:05:39.590> I'm<00:05:39.650> doing<00:05:39.979> here<00:05:40.159> the<00:05:40.280> back

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
careful with why I'm doing here the back

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.870 
careful with why I'm doing here the back
ease<00:05:40.669> off<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.500> battery<00:05:42.500> is<00:05:42.740> just<00:05:43.430> there<00:05:43.639> sort

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
ease off the battery is just there sort

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.570 
ease off the battery is just there sort
of<00:05:43.970> stuck<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:44.389> there<00:05:44.979> hopefully<00:05:45.979> securely<00:05:46.370> you

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
of stuck in there hopefully securely you

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.020 
of stuck in there hopefully securely you
know<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.909> doesn't<00:05:46.940> fall<00:05:47.330> out

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
know so it doesn't fall out

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.290 
know so it doesn't fall out
still<00:05:50.030> got<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.240> Apple<00:05:50.510> symbol<00:05:52.060> still<00:05:53.060> it<00:05:53.180> is

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
still got the Apple symbol still it is

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.850 
still got the Apple symbol still it is
looking<00:05:53.539> much<00:05:53.900> much<00:05:54.409> better

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.980 

still<00:06:02.490> got<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.699> opposite<00:06:03.060> Bobby<00:06:03.509> Flay<00:06:03.750> I'm

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
still got the opposite Bobby Flay I'm

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.629 
still got the opposite Bobby Flay I'm
thinking<00:06:04.650> that's<00:06:04.740> because<00:06:05.069> it<00:06:05.190> might<00:06:05.460> be

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
thinking that's because it might be

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.409 
thinking that's because it might be
having<00:06:05.849> difficulty<00:06:06.300> starting<00:06:06.539> up<00:06:08.419> because

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
having difficulty starting up because

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.230 
having difficulty starting up because
I'm<00:06:09.509> sure<00:06:09.720> any<00:06:09.960> iPhone<00:06:10.610> being<00:06:11.610> dropped<00:06:11.910> in

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
I'm sure any iPhone being dropped in

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.400 
I'm sure any iPhone being dropped in
water<00:06:13.229> I<00:06:13.800> only<00:06:14.130> started<00:06:14.400> dummies<00:06:14.729> like<00:06:14.910> this

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
water I only started dummies like this

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.900 
water I only started dummies like this
you<00:06:16.410> will<00:06:16.500> be<00:06:16.650> very<00:06:16.770> unhappy<00:06:17.280> with<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.460> yeah

okay passcode screen right so numbers
going<00:06:28.050> in<00:06:28.289> working<00:06:29.720> notion<00:06:30.720> can<00:06:30.900> establish

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
going in working notion can establish

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.860 
going in working notion can establish
facts<00:06:31.740> I'm<00:06:31.919> taking<00:06:32.190> it<00:06:32.280> out<00:06:32.780> but<00:06:33.780> the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
facts I'm taking it out but the

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.219 
facts I'm taking it out but the
digitizer<00:06:34.409> I<00:06:35.150> can<00:06:36.150> feel<00:06:36.449> doing<00:06:36.960> things<00:06:37.310> so<00:06:39.229> let

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
digitizer I can feel doing things so let

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.040 
digitizer I can feel doing things so let
me<00:06:40.409> hold<00:06:40.889> down<00:06:41.099> the<00:06:41.220> power<00:06:41.250> button<00:06:41.870> and<00:06:42.870> do

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
me hold down the power button and do

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.370 
me hold down the power button and do
that<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:44.099> looks<00:06:44.340> like<00:06:44.580> a<00:06:45.169> feeling<00:06:46.169> I<00:06:46.259> was

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
that that looks like a feeling I was

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.710 
that that looks like a feeling I was
touching<00:06:46.860> that<00:06:47.039> there<00:06:47.250> it's<00:06:47.880> up<00:06:48.000> on<00:06:48.150> council

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
touching that there it's up on council

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.580 
touching that there it's up on council
right<00:06:49.530> so<00:06:49.949> this<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.460> looking<00:06:51.150> very<00:06:51.240> very<00:06:51.630> good

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590

right so this is looking very very good
I'll<00:06:53.159> just<00:06:53.310> notice<00:06:53.729> the<00:06:53.759> airport<00:06:54.300> so<00:06:54.569> another

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
I'll just notice the airport so another

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.080 
I'll just notice the airport so another
Apple<00:06:55.139> the<00:06:56.009> airport<00:06:56.460> symbol<00:06:56.909> they're
