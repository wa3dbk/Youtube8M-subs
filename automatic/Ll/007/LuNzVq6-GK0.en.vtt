00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.760
 I'll show you that in this video as 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:15.160
 make a protective case for the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.920
 The police here have to welcome 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.470
 power here to represent her to 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.939
 do this part of the team that integrates 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:33.360
 nor will it take distance from the pulley shaft 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:38.710
 of the motor will represent on a plate 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.760
 make a line download measure here do 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 another line in the squad so you go 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.649
 the diameter will measure the diameter of the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.879
 poly and will talk a little bit bigger 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:01:01.350
 huh 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:07.840
 A break here will trace circles here. 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.110
 reaching end to end of the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.520
 same thing in caring to leave it 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.230
 distance 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.880
 leave that distance here tea 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.950
 also down here that I want 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.730
 show what it's like to do with it 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.080
 she goes to her part in front and goes 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:35.170
 nestled up so I wanted to stay 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:42.040
 inside or put your hand on top of the poly 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:46.980
 Good belt to do just goes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:52.510
 set a time your police launched 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.110
 mpb4 bc is suitable to make the motor 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.110
 any here 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:24.959
 there was a height of 15 11 january 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.519
 place I'm doing here because it's 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.130
 family easier 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.470
 demonstrated that they can do this tactic 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.200
 separated later you put on top 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 again this is the rule this part is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.170
 a grid you could see could there in 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.720
 sees the military police need to go 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:57.890
 some maintenance or sometimes it is 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:57.890
 closed here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.989
 Now that comes a point you're going to have to 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.970
 do another part here since you do not 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.450
 will cut her round will cut into the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.580
 Straight after you will fold if you can 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.400
 cut whole can count on me 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:27.069
 do half a half here only do here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:31.360
 only here you get the measurement here goes 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:36.459
 having to pick up the diane diameter Dada 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:43.090
 police box box is here 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:53.500
 the diameter here gave of 154 you do 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:57.640
 that is 154 times 1.20 1.57 242 goes from 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.420
 more or less like half the half 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:07.060
 so I'll play down here 121 and 121 forth 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.780
 but where it comes from and 157 157 half dp if 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.280
 remember 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.450
 Take the diameter of the box you made here 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.630
 1.57 times will give this piece you 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.169
 will have to cut here how to do 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:31.470
 half and half 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:31.470
 then it reaches 121 10 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:58.260
 Okay, now I'll take this measure here. 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:12.720
 do the same thing I did this 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:18.750
 As far as I'm going to get 3 103 months 1.57 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:21.290
 that half from 161 in 71 162 / 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:27.780
 2009 81 each side 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:44.120
 let's put 80 into one however 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:44.120
 No one is ready, I'll do the other side. 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.440
 ready will now cut time worked 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.400
 here it is cut 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.400
 now I'll fold 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:04.229
 yesterday my box 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:07.039
 my politics in there I think until 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.039
 you can smoke 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.039
 I think it's very simple to do but it's okay 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.509
 the other is always a lot of people always do 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.509
 this is short delivery
