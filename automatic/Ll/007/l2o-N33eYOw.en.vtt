put this in my pocket while they're not
looking<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.210> they<00:01:29.360> think<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.899> card

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
looking and so they think that the card

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.600 
looking and so they think that the card
box<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:30.890> hand<00:01:31.100> because<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.490> obviously

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
box is in this hand because it obviously

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.520 
box is in this hand because it obviously
made<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.240> look<00:01:32.390> like<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:32.870> I<00:01:32.930> put<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.320> there

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
made it look like that I put in there

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.080 
made it look like that I put in there
but<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.740> actually<00:01:33.920> switched<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.610> for<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.909> deck

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
but I actually switched it for the deck

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330 
but I actually switched it for the deck
so<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:36.170> need<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.470> snap<00:01:36.740> my<00:01:36.950> fingers

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
so then I just need to snap my fingers

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.969 
so then I just need to snap my fingers
or<00:01:37.640> wave<00:01:38.060> my<00:01:38.270> hand<00:01:38.510> over<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.530> did<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:39.860> the

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
or wave my hand over like I did in the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.430 
or wave my hand over like I did in the
demo<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.659> do<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:43.159> then<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.490> turns

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
demo and I do that and then it turns

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.260 
demo and I do that and then it turns
completely<00:01:45.440> into<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.580> deck<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.909> cards<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:49.270> just
