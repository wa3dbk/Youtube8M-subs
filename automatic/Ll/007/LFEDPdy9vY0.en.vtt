00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.359
 [music] 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.160
 hello everyone you sang from behind me 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:14.110
 is a sheep this is 114 part of mine 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.950
 craft mechanisms and today I'll show you 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.140
 such a mechanism is an activator 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.210
 in fact, it’s not just an activator 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.210
 activator on the note block we click on 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 the necessary block and the activator works like 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.000
 we see it works fine we press 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.430
 great just mechanisms are very secretive 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.260
 let's say if you don’t have a lamp here 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.269
 let's say here you have such a door 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.089
 piston 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:43.120
 then when pressed it will open and and 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.760
 just stealth over9000 therefore 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 I advise everyone 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.280
 i would say i thought it up myself but 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.780
 now youtube filled just 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 message that this feature is out 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 which counts 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.690
 not my blog as a block that changes its 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.699
 which is updated during how 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.760
 you activate it essentially it before 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.549
 updated but earlier his house is not protected 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.039
 shaft and now there is a new house like this 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.780
 that house looks like this 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.280
 absolutely now I'll show you how he is 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 working principle it works fine 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.450
 it works let's say on the same note 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.079
 the blocks here it works so we activate 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.820
 him and it works besides if on 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.369
 put the block and activate it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.689
 it will not reproduce the sound and all 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.469
 anyway it will work that is it 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 awesome thing here and also he 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:43.869
 works here let's say through the wall here 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.079
 by the way he is here and the unit is working on 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.359
 comparator and here through the wall too its 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.299
 can be activated here if 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:55.780
 put as you see here but here 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.469
 It works only torch redstone dust and 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.659
 Repeat the diet and wear the house itself 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.030
 based on this comparator that is it 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.579
 the basis of the comparator you put something 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.610
 activated and from the comparator can 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.799
 only use 4 and the theme to make it 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.230
 in the block from the comparator is a diet 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.330
 Again, a torch and a repeater 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.760
 musical block which 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.680
 Here, too, it works now I will teach you 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.840
 do this circuit principle you see yourself 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 Well, I'll show you just in case 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.730
 block on him a torch on him sticky 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.100
 the piston on it block now we take the chest 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.580
 put the usual blocks from the block on which 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.300
 there is a package itself this one here is a chest 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.190
 then we put here the comparator and the middle 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.690
 we stuff one thing 1 item 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.580
 trying bottom is not important here 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.860
 all the scheme is working right now there is no well 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.750
 let's say yes see near near 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.420
 the comparator is triggered either belly 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.610
 again red town stop what i do 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.480
 Redstone as you can see at once two schemes 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.760
 lights in my opinion a great thing just 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.500
 now if you can you know how 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.870
 do i just thought about 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.510
 this look carefully here it is you 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.100
 floor 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.650
 half of you is a musical block which 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.290
 Well, you say, and then the wall here so I 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.750
 I don't know right now 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.739
 go in general you press and you 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.370
 activated here is the scheme let's say so 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.450
 now look here so here and here 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.239
 sticky piston works let's say yes 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.510
 so I do not even know how to put it all 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:44.570
 so that there was beauty here for example 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.100
 here and here to me here a torch to disturb here 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:58.620
 so here 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 to attack yes no so here now yes here 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.400
 everything and your door 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.530
 let's close it means you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.150
 click on the block and the door closes 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.400
 here is one door on the other side 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.460
 it is possible to invent a second door 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.290
 can anything really so in 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.870
 principle you can be sure that 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.410
 the scheme is simply unique in itself 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.970
 here is such it is interesting here and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.100
 that's all i won't be much there 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.020
 bother to show some traps 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.000
 you will come up with something yourself if you want 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.830
 see traps then collect huskies under 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.390
 this video when enough is typed 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.880
 amount and this I don't know how much 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.680
 how much can you type then I 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.690
 I'll show you the traps you can 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.760
 use with this scheme on this all 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.340
 thank you all for watching subscribe 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.330
 on the channel put your fingers with you was singing and 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.330
 bb
