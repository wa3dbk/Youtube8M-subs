00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.880
 so after I had already boarded that also wanted the Xbox 60 under 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.379
 under 6 PP costs 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.239
 um again makes a little too expensive for the pop-band connection 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.819
 this was under Windows Vista 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.769
 around 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.679
 so first with 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.159
 give a pass under the page and look 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.230
 clearly that's the reason to create I already have 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.880
 if you then declared 2 percent just here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.979
 via e-mail 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.360
 cellphone number request a malicious code 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 Customers will then call via e-mail 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.710
 under customer service in the customer area 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.330
 the back on Install a 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.800

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 Heckendorn under point 2 again our open followed at the end of July 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 Left on and Baden and the program down 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 after we heard close again 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 then us who's here 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 the funds can with the card 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 so in the woods 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 round 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 Security message burglary reinstall 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.580
 Round - 6 it was a little faster 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 though 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 and Pia when it's done here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 in several places 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 No 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.409
 as next percent 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.939
 next step now here on start 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.849
 network 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.659
 If this window is synonymous earn up here synonymous Network and Sharing Center 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 then we also manage network connections here 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.119
 there are three connections again 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.449
 once here my 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.879
 w-lan connect my laptop with me 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.709
 connected to the internet 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.909
 my lan connection from the laptop over the I later the Xbox 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.889
 connect fire 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.219
 and again the virtual network appeal to Gnome 2 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 now he went first 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.599
 up and running at connections 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.599
 with right-click properties 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.419
 So here we see internet protocol version 4 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.599
 highlight and click Properties 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.249
 let's go now 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.629
 at both points 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.239
 Kind of wanting to use the explained and then we do not want to go is one 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.469
 szo 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.949
 once 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.569
 Let's enter ITER Dressel's 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.789
 under 92 and 68 01 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.449

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.489
 0 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.749
 1 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.749
 Then we went under 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.639
 it has rows with mask 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.539
 Just click it and then 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.879
 Grisham automatically set the Werther 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.299
 around 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.299
 We can release the rest and clear it up in the reconstruction 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.309
 because next step would be now 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.319

 one hundred 92 out of 68 0 and the 1 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 then we still put in by manually referring to 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.349
