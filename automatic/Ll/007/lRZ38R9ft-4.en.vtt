the sinking hyper herring I just want to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.799 
the sinking hyper herring I just want to
take<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.340> sec<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.610> explain<00:00:11.120> this<00:00:11.240> bait<00:00:11.480> show<00:00:11.750> it

to<00:00:11.959> you<00:00:12.050> in<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.230> water<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:13.010> know<00:00:13.099> what<00:00:13.219> I

to you in the water so you know what I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.980 
to you in the water so you know what I
was<00:00:13.429> thinking<00:00:13.490> when<00:00:13.849> I<00:00:13.940> made<00:00:14.150> it<00:00:14.300> so<00:00:14.719> that<00:00:14.750> you

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
was thinking when I made it so that you

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.260 
was thinking when I made it so that you
can<00:00:15.139> apply<00:00:15.349> it<00:00:15.469> to<00:00:15.679> your<00:00:15.799> arsenal<00:00:16.029> what<00:00:17.029> it<00:00:17.150> is

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
can apply it to your arsenal what it is

can apply it to your arsenal what it is
I<00:00:17.300> built<00:00:17.660> this<00:00:17.779> beta<00:00:18.050> sinks<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.820> in<00:00:20.119> mind<00:00:20.630> what

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
I built this beta sinks so in mind what

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.659 
I built this beta sinks so in mind what
I<00:00:20.899> was<00:00:21.050> thinking<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.470> I'll<00:00:21.680> throw<00:00:22.160> it<00:00:22.279> out<00:00:22.430> and

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
I was thinking is I'll throw it out and

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.550 
I was thinking is I'll throw it out and
run<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.000> at<00:00:23.119> 10<00:00:23.329> feet<00:00:23.540> deep<00:00:23.599> I<00:00:24.020> always<00:00:24.380> have<00:00:24.529> a

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
run it at 10 feet deep I always have a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.290 
run it at 10 feet deep I always have a
hard<00:00:24.619> time<00:00:24.919> with<00:00:25.099> BT<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:25.579> pulling<00:00:25.939> down<00:00:26.090> or

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
hard time with BT that pulling down or

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.839 
hard time with BT that pulling down or
playing<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:26.750> up<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:27.950> I<00:00:27.980> did<00:00:28.099> is<00:00:28.220> I<00:00:28.399> spent

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
playing it up so what I did is I spent

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.580 
playing it up so what I did is I spent
the<00:00:28.939> time<00:00:29.149> develop<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.930> bait<00:00:30.110> so<00:00:30.349> that<00:00:30.500> it

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
the time develop the bait so that it

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.109 
the time develop the bait so that it
would<00:00:30.680> run<00:00:30.829> perfectly<00:00:31.369> at<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.759> depth<00:00:31.970> you

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
would run perfectly at the depth you

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.370 
would run perfectly at the depth you
wanted<00:00:32.419> like<00:00:32.509> if<00:00:32.660> you're<00:00:32.780> fishing<00:00:32.989> water

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
wanted like if you're fishing water

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.490 
wanted like if you're fishing water
columns<00:00:34.540> thermal<00:00:35.540> Cline's<00:00:35.809> if<00:00:36.350> you're

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
columns thermal Cline's if you're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.340 
columns thermal Cline's if you're
fishing<00:00:36.890> structure<00:00:37.850> grass<00:00:38.570> beds<00:00:38.960> whatever

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
fishing structure grass beds whatever

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.040 
fishing structure grass beds whatever
you<00:00:39.530> can<00:00:39.680> it'll<00:00:40.220> it'll<00:00:40.730> truly<00:00:41.150> track<00:00:41.480> at<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
you can it'll it'll truly track at the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.620 
you can it'll it'll truly track at the
depth<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.470> engage<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.000> by<00:00:44.570> doing

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
depth that you engage it at so by doing

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.790 
depth that you engage it at so by doing
that<00:00:44.960> what<00:00:45.170> I'm<00:00:45.290> going<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.470> do<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:45.680> I'm<00:00:45.770> going

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
that what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.350 
that what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:00:45.950> check<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.280> out<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:46.820> I'm<00:00:47.000> gonna<00:00:47.150> run<00:00:47.330> it

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
to check it out and I'm gonna run it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.560 
to check it out and I'm gonna run it
about<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> foot<00:00:47.780> deep<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.390> depending<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.450> my

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
about a foot deep and depending on my

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.300 
about a foot deep and depending on my
speed<00:00:50.900> it'll<00:00:51.110> go<00:00:51.320> deeper<00:00:52.840> or<00:00:53.840> stay<00:00:54.410> up<00:00:54.560> so

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
speed it'll go deeper or stay up so

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:08.630 
speed it'll go deeper or stay up so
anyways<00:00:56.000> let's<00:00:56.030> give<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.329> a<00:00:56.390> shot<00:00:57.940> let's<00:00:58.940> go

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 

now<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.479> doing<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.870> running<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
now what I'm doing is I'm running at a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.860 
now what I'm doing is I'm running at a
medium<00:01:10.770> retrieve<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:12.120> you'll<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> let<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
medium retrieve and you'll see I let it

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.870 
medium retrieve and you'll see I let it
sink<00:01:13.110> down<00:01:13.260> about<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> foot<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> run

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
sink down about a foot it's going to run

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
sink down about a foot it's going to run
a<00:01:14.909> foot<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.479> way<00:01:15.600> back<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.050> boat<00:01:16.200> even

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a foot all the way back to the boat even

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
a foot all the way back to the boat even
though<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.770> lines<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> water<00:01:17.610> it's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
though my lines out of the water it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
though my lines out of the water it's
still<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.780> track<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> foot<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
still going to track about a foot and I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
still going to track about a foot and I
can<00:01:20.369> let<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.580> sink<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> cool

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
can let it sink down one of the cool

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.770 
can let it sink down one of the cool
things<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> snap<00:01:23.190> your<00:01:23.220> rod

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
things is that when you snap your rod

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.109 
things is that when you snap your rod
it's<00:01:24.780> got<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.259> nice<00:01:25.470> erratic<00:01:29.119> really

it's got a really nice erratic really

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's got a really nice erratic really
nice<00:01:30.270> slow<00:01:30.720> speed<00:01:31.110> high<00:01:31.710> speed<00:01:31.740> doesn't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
nice slow speed high speed doesn't

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.109
