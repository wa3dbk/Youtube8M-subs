wanted to show you how we link a few of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.950 
wanted to show you how we link a few of
the<00:00:05.670> spins<00:00:05.940> together<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.509> talk<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> lot<00:00:06.930> about

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the spins together you talk a lot about

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.890 
the spins together you talk a lot about
different<00:00:07.799> chain<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.460> techniques<00:00:08.910> let's<00:00:09.630> link

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
different chain of techniques let's link

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410 
different chain of techniques let's link
them<00:00:10.019> up<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.349> show<00:00:10.830> them<00:00:10.860> smoothly<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.210> here's

some of the movie done so far by chamber

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.660 
some of the movie done so far by chamber
we've<00:00:14.790> done<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> regular<00:00:15.450> Florence<00:00:15.780> pin<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
we've done a regular Florence pin and we

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.450 
we've done a regular Florence pin and we
have<00:00:17.850> work<00:00:18.660> done<00:00:18.900> doing<00:00:19.140> underarm<00:00:19.890> changes

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
have work done doing underarm changes

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
have work done doing underarm changes
and<00:00:20.789> we're<00:00:21.689> coming<00:00:22.020> under<00:00:22.289> our<00:00:22.380> changes<00:00:22.859> back

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
and we're coming under our changes back

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.720 
and we're coming under our changes back
and<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:24.180> again<00:00:24.449> underarm<00:00:25.220> underarm<00:00:26.220> also

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and then again underarm underarm also

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
work on doing underarm and spinning and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.010 
work on doing underarm and spinning and
then<00:00:30.929> again<00:00:31.199> underarm<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.300> spinning<00:00:33.300> we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
then again underarm and spinning we

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170 
then again underarm and spinning we
worked<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> between<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> leg<00:00:34.860> changes<00:00:35.610> where

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
worked on between the leg changes where

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
worked on between the leg changes where
they<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.600> leg<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.129> over

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
they use our leg just what get it over

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.060 
they use our leg just what get it over
and<00:00:38.760> spin<00:00:39.030> again<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.110> more<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.710> leg

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and spin again and one more time you leg

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
and spin again and one more time you leg
spins<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> over<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> top<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:43.230> worked<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
spins and over the top we worked on

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
spins and over the top we worked on
behalf<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> Matadors<00:00:44.820> where<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> actually

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
behalf of Matadors where if you actually

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.260 
behalf of Matadors where if you actually
go<00:00:45.570> under<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> arm<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> neck<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
go under the arm and over the neck and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
go under the arm and over the neck and
you<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> let<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> come<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.239> okay<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you just kind of let it come off okay so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
you just kind of let it come off okay so
we<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.629> under<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> arm<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> neck<00:00:53.460> let<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we go under the arm over the neck let it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
we go under the arm over the neck let it
come<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.989> under<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> arm<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
come up there get under the arm over the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
come up there get under the arm over the
neck<00:00:56.730> let<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> come<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.079> step

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
neck let it come up we use you be step

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
neck let it come up we use you be step
so<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.920> go<00:00:58.980> under<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> arm<00:00:59.550> over<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> next

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so we go under the arm over the next

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
so we go under the arm over the next
step<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> evolution<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:02.359> half<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> go

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
step in the evolution back half so go

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.880 
step in the evolution back half so go
back<00:01:04.970> half<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.260> Backman<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
back half that will Backman in the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
back half that will Backman in the
pullback<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.210> under<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> arm<00:01:09.840> or

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
pullback we have to go under the arm or

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
pullback we have to go under the arm or
the<00:01:10.409> neck<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> spin<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the neck and we spin it like that

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990 
the neck and we spin it like that
nunchuck<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.310> go<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
nunchuck this way then we go over the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.230 
nunchuck this way then we go over the
top<00:01:15.240> spin<00:01:16.020> through<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> come<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.119> go

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
top spin through and come back so we go

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.490 
top spin through and come back so we go
full<00:01:18.780> net<00:01:19.049> dog<00:01:19.759> step<00:01:20.759> forward<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> come<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
full net dog step forward is come up and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.179 
full net dog step forward is come up and
spin<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.509> talked<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:25.189> going

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
spin back I think we talked about going

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.609 
spin back I think we talked about going
over<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> end<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.650> bit

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
over the end of it and have a little bit

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
over the end of it and have a little bit
and<00:01:31.619> again<00:01:35.420> did<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.540> talk<00:01:36.689> about<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.140> way

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and again did we talk about the way

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.399 
and again did we talk about the way
around<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> waist<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.159> spinning<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.240> my

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
around the waist and spinning in my

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.489 
around the waist and spinning in my
horsemen<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.850> how<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.909> tournament<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:45.469> a

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
number two where we totally start with

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.590 
number two where we totally start with
the<00:01:48.619> two<00:01:48.859> together<00:01:49.210> then<00:01:50.210> when<00:01:50.359> we're<00:01:50.569> ready

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
he's fanned out into a beautiful number

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.499 
he's fanned out into a beautiful number
two<00:01:54.799> almost<00:01:55.159> like<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> pretend<00:01:55.759> Sabbath<00:01:56.270> I'll
