00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.299
 Ukrainian security forces cease 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.109
 trying to fight off the air at the Harbor 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.940
 militias 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.250
 however, Donetsk people's fighters 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 Republic manages to restrain counterattack 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 more about the situation at the airport of Donetsk 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 my colleague will tell you special 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:26.060
 life news correspondent 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.060
 Peg's seed look out the courageous plan 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.719
 Now the active phase of the operation has begun. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 by sweeping carl with this extreme point already 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.190
 actually behind the runway 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 Donetsk airport where are 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 positions of the Ukrainian military now we 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 hear the gunfire from conventional weapons not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.239
 meaning artillery also hear volleys 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.489
 grads from the Ukrainian positions 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 originally the plan was the following general 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.970
 the artillery of the militia processed here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.720
 positions near cheese and all your greens 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.560
 which is behind them behind these positions then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 left 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.810
 several tanks of militia just here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.299
 precisely the tank shells breaks and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.479
 seen on their television screens after 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.350
 how the tanks will depart the fire group 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 which is based here on 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.829
 collapsed control tower will be 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.829
 cover up their waste 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.990
 cover up the waste of tanks in general not 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 I had to position near the radar militia 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.630
 actually taken before our eyes here you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 Seen the silhouettes of people this already militias 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.830
 protect basic dugouts 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.830
 Ukrainian military who were 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.310
 are located exactly on and growth they have there 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.580
 everything was teaching secretive squirrels that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 intelligence worked but worked very 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.140
 neatly so that we have no losses and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 Respectively from a little bit 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.550
 time since the seizure of this territory but 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.090
 picked up the strength picked up all the information 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.010
 we made such a blitzkrieg and borrow 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.250
 territory tell them there was hidden 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.920
 exact a large number of appliances was 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.970
 It was yes there was always a technique 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.430
 2-3 tanks it was constantly here and bmp 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.850
 The LCD also went and practiced on 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.950
 to the other flank how do you see now 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 breaks careless 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.170
 armored battalion east in the rear 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.970
 here on the control tower covers 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 their Republican guard Donetsk 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.580
 People's Republic to the unit 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.489
 amine armored vehicles bmp and btr after 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.070
 of how the sweep began she rls 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.600
 went there for help and to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.269
 to gain a foothold in general so that the Ukrainian 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.230
 the military could not make a counter attack 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.780
 and repel this strategic point 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.140
 back so much otvetka like here 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.870
 call on the slang the militia here yes 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.209
 control towers crashes but the answer 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.209
 this is ukrainian artillery 120 mortars 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.750
 so the militia end of the day 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.270
 pushed aside 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.180
 another kilometer approximately 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.540
 front line around the Donetsk airport 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.910
 on its perimeter that is for the radar already 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.640
 now we hear shooting battle I'm in 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.220
 tree plantings and they are also cleaned there 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.470
 any units or sabotage 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.880
 Ukrainian military groups if left 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.950
 it is also literally overnight 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.510
 will be knocked out from there as reported to us 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.690
 here and headquarters I will note that until that moment 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.459
 until the radar was cleared in one 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.910
 full security at the forefront 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.459
 near the collapsed tower as well as 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.820
 fire part if she look here 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.940
 there face and defense with is on the right 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.980
 on the eve of the Abkhaz fighters tried to hold 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.100
 sweep there actually were clamped in 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.820
 pincers are precisely with the radar group and 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.370
 moved forward 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.380
 and blocked them there only with a covering 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.600
 nights managed to return to the original 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.100
 positions here now in general 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.180
 move more or less calmly 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.880
 can be here directly to the control room 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.310
 towers to the firehouse and in fact 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.770
 square by square but not once 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.680
 said that the airport is under control 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.690
 over sweep square by square 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.950
 continues daily and repeat again 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.100
 one kilometer 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.580
 the front line is moved forward from 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.580
 the airport
