what<00:01:09.530> are<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.710> benefits<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.490> well

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
what are the benefits of this well

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.690 
what are the benefits of this well
memory<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:11.930> runs<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.350> lower<00:01:12.560> voltage<00:01:13.040> means

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
memory that runs on lower voltage means

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.090 
memory that runs on lower voltage means
less<00:01:14.120> heat<00:01:14.450> everybody<00:01:15.290> knows<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.530> heat<00:01:15.950> is

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
less heat everybody knows that heat is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100 
less heat everybody knows that heat is
the<00:01:16.130> enemy<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.790> your<00:01:17.150> computer<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:17.990> has

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
the enemy of your computer it's what has

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.900 
the enemy of your computer it's what has
lots<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.470> fan<00:01:18.770> noise<00:01:19.070> when<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.520> go<00:01:19.670> crazy

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
lots of fan noise when you go crazy

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.570 
lots of fan noise when you go crazy
doing<00:01:20.300> cooling<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:20.960> all<00:01:21.380> about<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.860> heat<00:01:22.070> so

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
doing cooling it's all about the heat so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.490 
doing cooling it's all about the heat so
when<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.760> have<00:01:22.910> low<00:01:23.330> voltage<00:01:23.840> memory<00:01:24.200> running

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
when you have low voltage memory running

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.530 
when you have low voltage memory running
in<00:01:24.590> your<00:01:24.710> system<00:01:25.130> this<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.760> great<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.300> instead

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
in your system this is great so instead

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540 
in your system this is great so instead
of<00:01:26.600> your<00:01:26.840> computer<00:01:27.200> spending<00:01:27.560> time<00:01:27.770> cooling

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
of your computer spending time cooling

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.130 
of your computer spending time cooling
the<00:01:28.670> memory<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.180> cooling<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.600> system<00:01:29.960> it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the memory and cooling the system it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.380 
the memory and cooling the system it
just<00:01:30.500> runs<00:01:30.770> at<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> much<00:01:31.640> better<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.330> much

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
just runs at a much better and much

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.840 
just runs at a much better and much
cooler<00:01:33.140> rate<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.250> excellent<00:01:34.550> for<00:01:34.670> those

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
cooler rate this is excellent for those

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.240 
cooler rate this is excellent for those
people<00:01:35.030> who<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.390> HT<00:01:35.840> pcs<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.530> you'd<00:01:37.010> instead

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
people who have HT pcs and you'd instead

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.500 
people who have HT pcs and you'd instead
a<00:01:37.280> real<00:01:37.490> close<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:37.880> their<00:01:38.030> ears<00:01:38.240> where<00:01:38.420> they

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
a real close to their ears where they

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.910 
a real close to their ears where they
don't<00:01:38.750> want<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:38.960> hear<00:01:39.050> any<00:01:39.230> type<00:01:39.410> of<00:01:39.440> noise<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
don't want to hear any type of noise and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.130 
don't want to hear any type of noise and
all<00:01:40.010> traditional<00:01:40.520> cooling<00:01:40.940> so<00:01:41.480> this<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.960> what

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
all traditional cooling so this is what

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140 
all traditional cooling so this is what
this<00:01:42.290> is<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.220> an<00:01:43.310> introduction<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.090> to

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
this is this is an introduction just to

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.490 
this is this is an introduction just to
show<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.480> benefits<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:44.990> what<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.290> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
show you the benefits and what this is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.560 
show you the benefits and what this is
we'll<00:01:45.920> be<00:01:46.040> making<00:01:46.430> another<00:01:46.520> video<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.390> show

we'll be making another video to show
you<00:01:47.630> how<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.380> done<00:01:48.440> how<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.070> get<00:01:49.250> these<00:01:49.430> XMP

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
you how it's done how to get these XMP

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.880 
you how it's done how to get these XMP
profiles<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:50.810> how<00:01:50.840> well<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.260> does<00:01:51.410> run<00:01:51.680> in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
profiles and how well it does run in

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.540 
profiles and how well it does run in
your<00:01:52.130> system<00:01:52.580> thanks<00:01:53.150> for<00:01:53.270> watching
