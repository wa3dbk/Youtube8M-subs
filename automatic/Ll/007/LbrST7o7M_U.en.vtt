really an interesting thing to come to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.049 
really an interesting thing to come to
human<00:00:12.719> design<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.379> realize<00:00:13.709> that<00:00:13.999> you<00:00:14.999> know

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
human design and realize that you know

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.470 
human design and realize that you know
it's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.329> 50/50<00:00:15.990> deal<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> planet<00:00:16.920> guys<00:00:17.480> 50%

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it's a 50/50 deal on the planet guys 50%

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.269 
it's a 50/50 deal on the planet guys 50%
of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> beings<00:00:19.109> half<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.769> specie

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of the beings half of the specie

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.130 
of the beings half of the specie
basically<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.179> putting<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.779> an<00:00:21.929> emotional

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
basically is putting on an emotional

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.109 
basically is putting on an emotional
wave<00:00:22.590> they're<00:00:22.859> putting<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.340> an<00:00:23.640> emotional

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
wave they're putting out an emotional

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990 
wave they're putting out an emotional
frequency<00:00:24.599> into<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.929> world<00:00:25.759> and<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.910> other

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
frequency into the world and the other

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.480 
frequency into the world and the other
half<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.509> taking<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> amplifying<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
half are taking it in and amplifying it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.870 
half are taking it in and amplifying it
and<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:31.560> difference<00:00:32.279> between<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and this difference between the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
and this difference between the
emotional<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.540> non<00:00:33.750> emotional<00:00:34.350> beings<00:00:35.250> are

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
emotional and non emotional beings are

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.979 
emotional and non emotional beings are
specie<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.469> me<00:00:37.680> seems<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.370> significant<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.510> not

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
specie to me seems as significant if not

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.040 
specie to me seems as significant if not
more<00:00:40.500> even<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.280> aura<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.030> mean<00:00:42.719> literally

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
more even than aura I mean literally

more even than aura I mean literally
really<00:00:43.260> guys<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.739> almost<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
really guys I almost think that the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
really guys I almost think that the
break<00:00:45.180> should<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.809> emotional<00:00:46.320> bond

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
break should be your emotional bond

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
break should be your emotional bond
emotional<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.609> floor<00:00:47.820> art

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
emotional and then into the floor art

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
emotional and then into the floor art
types<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.989> makes<00:00:49.199> sense<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> because

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
types if that makes sense to you because

types if that makes sense to you because
it's<00:00:50.579> black<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> white<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:52.050> either

it's black and white you know either

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's black and white you know either
your<00:00:53.090> authority<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.449> emotions<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your authority is emotions and all you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
your authority is emotions and all you
can<00:00:55.859> trust<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> emotions<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.300> authority

can trust is emotions or your authority

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
can trust is emotions or your authority
is<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.079> emotions<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.920> never<00:00:59.430> trust<00:00:59.760> your

it's got twice as much emotion in fact
it's<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:07.080> twice<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.590> much

it's got way more than twice as much

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's got way more than twice as much
because<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.400> taking<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because it's been taking in and

through<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:16.860> deconditioning<00:01:17.520> process<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
through my deconditioning process I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
through my deconditioning process I
assumed<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> had<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.680> many<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> would

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
assumed that I had so many what I would

assumed that I had so many what I would
call<00:01:20.610> emotional<00:01:20.820> breakdowns<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.110> time

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
call emotional breakdowns is is time

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.890 
call emotional breakdowns is is time
times<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.780> know

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
times more like I just you know

ribbiting tears because I'll scare you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
ribbiting tears because I'll scare you
guys<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:31.310> get<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.399> far<00:01:32.640> enough<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> be

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
guys off get in far enough not to be

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.340 
guys off get in far enough not to be
able<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.049> I'll<00:01:34.140> tell<00:01:34.290> you

the<00:01:34.500> truth<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.259> mean<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> assumed<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the truth but I mean I just assumed that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
the truth but I mean I just assumed that
that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> toxin<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:40.100> emotions<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that was the toxin of emotions that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
that was the toxin of emotions that
weren't<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.759> being<00:01:42.270> miss<00:01:42.509> stored<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> my<00:01:43.170> body

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
weren't me being miss stored in my body

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
weren't me being miss stored in my body
or<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:44.009> form<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.630> through

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
or in my form and as I was going through

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840 
or in my form and as I was going through
my<00:01:45.899> cellular<00:01:46.439> process<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.100> changing<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
my cellular process it was changing so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
my cellular process it was changing so
we<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.439> different<00:01:49.770> beings<00:01:50.159> I

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
we have these two different beings I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
we have these two different beings I
mean<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
mean really different you know is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
mean really different you know is
different<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> blocking<00:01:52.680> life<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.219> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
different is blocking life you know the

gives us the beautiful diversity we out
on<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:48.910> planet<00:05:49.330> why<00:05:49.960> do<00:05:50.020> they<00:05:50.229> like<00:05:50.380> anyone

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830

else why not be uniquely you that's what
human<00:05:54.280> design<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.790> it's<00:05:55.570> waiting<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.110> be

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
human design is it's waiting to be

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.979 
human design is it's waiting to be
uniquely<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:58.320> so<00:05:59.320> that's<00:05:59.500> my<00:05:59.710> perspective
