00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.409
 I went to youtube a few days ago 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.080
 I did not find any specific review to 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.390
 minimum boxing that could not give any 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.609
 idea that this phone is more or less 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320
 so for all the people that I 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.750
 that they are asking for a review 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.589

 good introduction us what is the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.660
 unboxing came recently from the company 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.250
 I'm here in Chile I bought it for 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.650
 approximately 110 120 dollars 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.390
 good until the first things of 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.960
 phone 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.960
 sources 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.980
 we have more of mine 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.000
 comes with this this tripod shape 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.800
 to put it horizontally in its 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.350
 main attractive that in case it is 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.580
 on the television 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 an adapter that is universal 110 220 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.759
 the cable for the data connection and the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.420
 Hands- free power connection 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.460
 a cover that explained seeing bone 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 the screen turns on and off 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.630
 when we close and depending on the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.540
 country where we are going to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 have to change the flag and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 good the rest of papers 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.400
 but then the important thing is the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.430
 phone the truth is that I do not 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.910
 used a lot I got today and I do not 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.950
 I know in terms of their performance 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.850
 let's say battery and design what what 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 more we are interested 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.320
 as you will see here is a phone for crazy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.070
 with 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.070
 my family 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.120
 There are 4 is almost the same size 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.769
 is a screen I think of 4 inches 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.730
 if it comes with the operating system of 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.489
 living 4.2 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.340
 according to the specifications of the page 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.700
 says that if a battery of 1500mah perez 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 that could eventually help me 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.780
 less than one video 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.439
 then as you see the phone is 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.340
 fluid at the beginning did not install a 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:50.170
 came only with the applications of 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.870
 that were already pre-installed 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.420
 an idea of ​​what the camera is 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.940
 many people out there wanted to know how to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.660
 he supposedly had a camera of 8 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.660
 megapixels 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.220
 to this 8 megapixels 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.930
 with flash 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.190
 now is that the quality I do not know how 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.540
 good closed but apparently 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.550
 it's not like we're going to use this 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.900
 phone primarily to take 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.440
 Photos 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 and good the rest of things that 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.310
 which are well known 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.709
 has a 1.3 dual processor with a 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.750
 internal memory of 4 gb all those 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.239
 four mid-12 arrivals is also 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.870
 to install your applications and the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.830
 rest of things 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.830
 has an expandable micro sd up to 32 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.240
 and that the front camera of 1.3 the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.430
 Today's back 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.430
 to install 4 points 1 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.209
 good and now the main thing that I think 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.689
 which is what motivates the purchase in many 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.689
 occasions that is the part of the TV 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.739
 but it has an antenna on its side 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.510
 upper left than if one the 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.220
 expand and you could see me with the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.240
 channels I do not do is that in this 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.240
 moment of a week 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.370
 on the right side the channel change 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.559
 I tried it a bit and the truth is that 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.129
 if you see on some channels there's no 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:40.919
 quality if of any number 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.550
 but if it's acceptable to see one that 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.550
 another game 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.180
 in addition the camera teaches such crises 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.600
 letters to the top that we have 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.840
 in the part of the charger and in the part 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.270
 of the audio jack the left side that 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.880
 there are no buttons the bottom one that we have 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.520
 the microphone neither buttons and the side 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.840
 right we have the button up to a 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.840
 the volume and the pay 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.610
 so that any doubt that they have 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.670
 leave the comments and then 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.460
 I will try to solve it then this was 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:26.600
 a small review and a small unboxing 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.600
 of what is the bio 778 s see you later
