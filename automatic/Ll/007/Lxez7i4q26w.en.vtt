00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 and well in the cold weather and you walk us 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.230
 being a little old fashioned so 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.360
 I made this new one and in this video you 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.430
 I explain how to do them all 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.799
 use what I found in a store 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.810
 fantasies miguel to me I liked these 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.859
 colors but you can use the ones that you 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.099
 like to take the pink stamen leaves metro 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 and a half and make a knot like that pass the subway 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.310
 and a half through the center of the knot 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 place the yarn on the first post and 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.530
 put the remainder through the center of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.530
 frame 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.710
 scale stamina by the poles of the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 frame in this way 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.550
 leave the last four posts 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.400
 with the hook take the knot below and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.720
 pass it over the post leaves the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.170
 up in place 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 asmismo with the other knots 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.380
 Take the loop with the hook and pass it 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.240
 above top gel in place 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.329
 and press down the stamen 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.870
 in this way do the same with all 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.240
 the posts 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.620
 in net to the next course of yarn 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 on top of the one that stayed on the posts 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.360
 now proceed as in step 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.570
 previous with the hook takes out the yarn 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 pass it over the top and press 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 down so again all the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 frame 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.510
 continue with another turn of yarn 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.730
 repeat all the previous steps 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.370
 take out the fabric that is coming out 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.510
 under the frame 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.200
 tg until completing 10 centimeters 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.980
 cut the yarn fiusha and tie if the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.980
 green stamen 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.340
 cut the ends in the net the stamen 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.310
 green on the posts just like the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.310
 previous steps and continues weaving 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.610
 weaves a segment of green yarn and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.570
 as long as you want from here 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.980
 already at the end leaves another segment of green 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.769
 same as the first 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.879
 I know that the stamen of the first post and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.879
 put the hook 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.930
 I took the one that comes from the skein 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.350
 and pass it through the ones you have from 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 this way 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.650
 do the same in each post 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.760
 pull out the yarn 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.000
 passes the hook and then knots 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.269
 at the end cut the yarn and with the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.659
 hook make a last row of knots 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.670
 the same way as in the previous step 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.670
 using the meter and a half that you left the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.599
 start and tie a knot at the end 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.650
 to top it takes 10 stretches of yarn 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:22.299
 of each color of about 40 centimeters 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:27.980
 take one of each color fold in half 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:32.080
 put the hook pulls the stamens and passes 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.070
 everyone in the middle forming a knot 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.900
 take out the hook and stretch the yarn 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.350
 complete the two ends of the scarf 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.310
 with these fringes and that's how you get it ready 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.310
 for the winter season
