00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.790
 Y 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.130
 here I will show you first that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.410
 God bless you I'm going to show you a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 stapes bending machine made by 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 myself with the tools that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.150
 we can get everywhere 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.029
 we have a 4x4 4x4 tube we can 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.499
 see he is cut to approximately 70 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.300
 centimeters 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:32.520
 we have a no-inch angle of 2 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 inches which gave screw 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 injured pierce what I did not put in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.350
 opposite direction to make the wall 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.310
 which will prevent the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 make me a bow when I'm bending 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.280
 then take the different measures of the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 of the bars one by one for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.590
 different stretchers I put one to 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.640
 12 centimeters to 10 centimeters I have measurements 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.989
 of 10 of 12 of 15 of 20 25 3 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.439
 from 30 to 50 centimeters 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.280
 taking to begin to elaborate this 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:17.159
 take as a point of reference and I made it 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.159
 this little bow here I made this lever 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 and says this lever which pierces and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.289
 I put two bearings inside and the but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 it was with the media bars all 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.729
 these chapels that are here are from 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.759
 mean all of them cross sideways 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.340
 to side as we can see in the part 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.369
 below the tool that you see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.520
 the holes where they spend the sun 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.920
 of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.920
 to give it more strength 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.090
 the reference point to be able to take 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.240
 the measures here here I have to have 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.660
 the reference point this arc is not 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.090
 a center with a compass and then cut it 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.710
 Say the circle and drill from here with the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.080
 first that was placed was this one here 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.420
 from now on he was taking one by one the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.330
 measure the distance from here to here 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.560
 until having all the measurements work 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.110
 it's very easy to do it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.480
 Anything else I can call her 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.510
 I put here here 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.080
 and fold it 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.600
 [Music] 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 i 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:36.680
 the plastic but 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 she to look at this area 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.890
 and they Doubles us 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.810
 We stayed then we had it here 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.810
 sorry for here 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.620
 we place it here and then we continue 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.580
 doing twice as much as we do 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.580
 is that I have to fix the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 it costs a little bit because more capital is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.120
 makes it much easier 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 let's have here with your hand for here 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.430
 as you can see this is a stretcher of 9 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.829
 millimeters 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.450
 five eighths would be more or less not 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:29.569
 sorry three eighths and we can already see that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.569
 I'm almost done a stirrup 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.679
 [Music] 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.890
 and here practically the last one is missing 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.650
 doubles and the stirrup is totally 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.170
 square 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.170
 and one more would need the last fold 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.020
 [Music] 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.800
 and here we can see 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.110
 the stirrup 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.300
 I did it in a clear rudimentary way 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.160
 this is not bad done either because it is not 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.630
 fixed and does not have the sea ​​and adds a 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.280
 piece of rebar without any measure 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.860
 specific but what I wanted to demonstrate 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.010
 that everyone can make their machine 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.750
 to have to bend your stirrups and so 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.390
 facilitate your work in the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.160
 construction god bless me god god 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.480
 I kept hope you are great 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.480
 utility god bless me
