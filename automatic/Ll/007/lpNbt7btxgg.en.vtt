this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> robot<00:00:45.390> used<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> world

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this is how the robot used the world

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
this is how the robot used the world
this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.470> where<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> robot<00:00:46.920> thinks<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this is where the robot thinks it is and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.960 
this is where the robot thinks it is and
this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.960> furniture<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.699> robot

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
this is all the furniture that the robot

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.450 
this is all the furniture that the robot
has<00:00:51.180> built<00:00:51.449> before<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.170> using<00:00:52.710> ice<00:00:52.920> cameras

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
has built before this using ice cameras

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
has built before this using ice cameras
you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.900> path<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you can see that this is the path that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
you can see that this is the path that
it's<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.769> to<00:00:55.920> follow<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> there

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.399 

so<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.320> wanna<00:01:01.620> cook<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.989> knows<00:01:04.199> how

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so if you wanna cook is and it knows how

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
so if you wanna cook is and it knows how
long<00:01:04.559> its<00:01:04.710> arms<00:01:04.949> are<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.759> tries<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
long its arms are right so it tries to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
long its arms are right so it tries to
figure<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.689> hey<00:01:06.900> Mark<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> park<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.619> pace<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
figure out hey Mark I park my pace to be

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.249 
figure out hey Mark I park my pace to be
able<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> co-captain<00:01:09.689> breach<00:01:10.049> that

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
able to have a co-captain breach that

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.830 
able to have a co-captain breach that
could<00:01:10.320> ring<00:01:10.560> back<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> table<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.180> we

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
could ring back to the table so we

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
could ring back to the table so we
simply<00:01:13.380> compute<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.399> set<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.090> possible

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
simply compute a set of possible

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
simply compute a set of possible
locations<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:16.170> drive<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
locations to drive to and then we have a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
locations to drive to and then we have a
navigation<00:01:18.119> planner<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
navigation planner that we have that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.300 
navigation planner that we have that
chooses<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.149> then<00:01:21.570> goes<00:01:22.020> there

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
chooses one of them and then goes there

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
chooses one of them and then goes there
looks<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> coke<00:01:23.970> shelf<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.159> determines

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
looks at the coke shelf and determines

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
looks at the coke shelf and determines
if<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.430> within<00:01:26.610> reach<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.149> then<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.420> turn<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
if it's within reach and then in turn it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
if it's within reach and then in turn it
adjusted<00:01:28.439> its<00:01:28.890> position<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
adjusted its position in the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.249 
adjusted its position in the
conservation<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.899> now<00:01:31.020> we're<00:01:31.140> just

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
conservation so right now we're just

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
conservation so right now we're just
getting<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.770> coke<00:01:32.070> area<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
getting to the coke area and then it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
getting to the coke area and then it's
gonna<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.740> its<00:01:34.950> camera<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> find<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.729> coke

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
gonna use its camera to find the coke

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
gonna use its camera to find the coke
cans<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.330> then<00:01:36.450> readjust<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.990> readjust<00:01:37.619> its

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
cans and then readjust to readjust its

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.730 
cans and then readjust to readjust its
position

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
position

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.560 
position
as<00:01:40.010> you<00:01:40.159> can<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.549> here<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.240> table

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
as you can see here this is the table

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.390 
as you can see here this is the table
that's<00:01:42.320> going<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.619> pick<00:01:42.740> up<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.040> can<00:01:43.159> see<00:01:43.280> it's

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
that's going to pick up you can see it's

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.070 
that's going to pick up you can see it's
detected<00:01:43.909> these<00:01:44.180> two<00:01:44.390> cookie<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.900> already

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
detected these two cookie and already

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.120 
detected these two cookie and already
these<00:01:45.710> are<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:47.090> two<00:01:47.270> cans<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.659> stuff<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
these are the two cans and stuff the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.460 
these are the two cans and stuff the
whole<00:01:49.369> table<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.820> made<00:01:50.000> up<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.210> these<00:01:50.330> dots<00:01:50.690> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
whole table is made up of these dots the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.590 
whole table is made up of these dots the
robot<00:01:51.770> used<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.369> entire<00:01:52.670> world<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.210> terms<00:01:53.450> of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
robot used the entire world in terms of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.020 
robot used the entire world in terms of
these<00:01:53.750> little<00:01:53.930> dots<00:01:54.350> floating<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.009> space<00:01:55.190> so

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
these little dots floating in space so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
these little dots floating in space so
the<00:01:56.180> sensors<00:01:56.600> like<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.020> camera

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the sensors like this camera

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380 
the sensors like this camera
these<00:01:58.950> dots<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.490> robot<00:01:59.820> are<00:01:59.909> obstacles

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
these dots to the robot are obstacles

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.870 
these dots to the robot are obstacles
they're<00:02:00.570> places<00:02:00.900> where<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> robot<00:02:01.380> can't<00:02:01.619> go

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
they're places where the robot can't go

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.590 
they're places where the robot can't go
or<00:02:02.880> put<00:02:03.150> its<00:02:03.270> arm

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
or put its arm

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.480 
or put its arm
so<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.530> I've<00:02:05.650> chosen<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.100> pick<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.370> this

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
so here it's I've chosen to pick up this

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.600 
so here it's I've chosen to pick up this
camp<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.120> it's<00:02:08.020> come<00:02:08.710> up<00:02:08.830> with<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.039> plan<00:02:09.399> to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
camp and it's come up with a plan to

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.550 
camp and it's come up with a plan to
move<00:02:09.820> its<00:02:10.000> arm<00:02:10.210> there<00:02:10.509> which<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.929> difficult<00:02:11.140> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
move its arm there which is difficult it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.620 
move its arm there which is difficult it
has<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.920> come<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.520> with<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.730> way<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.910> move<00:02:13.150> all<00:02:13.330> of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
has to come up with a way to move all of

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.300 
has to come up with a way to move all of
the<00:02:13.810> joints<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.410> arm<00:02:14.590> all<00:02:14.740> seven<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.190> them

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
the joints in the arm all seven of them

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.530 
the joints in the arm all seven of them
which<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.760> don't<00:02:15.850> really<00:02:16.000> think<00:02:16.209> about<00:02:16.360> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
which we don't really think about that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.570 
which we don't really think about that
the<00:02:16.750> robot<00:02:17.050> has<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:18.010> through<00:02:18.220> how<00:02:18.310> all

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the robot has to think through how all

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.610 
the robot has to think through how all
the<00:02:18.730> joints<00:02:18.940> move<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> way<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.660> bring<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the joints move in a way to bring the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.660 
the joints move in a way to bring the
arm<00:02:20.920> around<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.280> table<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:24.520> it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
arm around the table and and now it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.980 
arm around the table and and now it's
gonna<00:02:24.820> bring<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> soda<00:02:25.870> back<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> side<00:02:26.500> or

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
gonna bring the soda back to the side or

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.570 
gonna bring the soda back to the side or
you'll<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.800> will<00:02:29.950> choose<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> spot

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you'll see then it will choose a spot

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.370 
you'll see then it will choose a spot
that's<00:02:30.880> near<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.330> snacks<00:02:31.750> where<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.110> thinks

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
that's near the snacks where it thinks

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.830 
that's near the snacks where it thinks
if<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.830> stand<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.310> spot<00:02:33.430> I'll<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.540> able<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
if I stand in that spot I'll be able to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.240 
if I stand in that spot I'll be able to
reach<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.080> snack<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.470> here's<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.770> spot<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.070> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
reach a snack so here's the spot that it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.680 
reach a snack so here's the spot that it
chose

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
chose

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.560 
chose
so<00:02:38.110> also<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.880> want<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> point<00:02:40.180> out<00:02:40.300> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
so also I just want to point out that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.570 
so also I just want to point out that
you<00:02:41.230> know<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.710> these<00:02:41.830> two<00:02:41.890> tables<00:02:42.430> right

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
you know we have these two tables right

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.280 
you know we have these two tables right
in<00:02:42.730> such<00:02:42.910> odd<00:02:43.090> location<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.810> only<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.110> put

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
in such odd location so I only just put

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.580 
in such odd location so I only just put
all<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.400> food<00:02:46.270> across<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.080> wall<00:02:47.320> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
all of the food across this wall and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.020 
all of the food across this wall and
then<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.800> can<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:47.980> drive<00:02:48.280> easily<00:02:48.460> from<00:02:48.850> there

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
then it can just drive easily from there

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.030 
then it can just drive easily from there
to<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.210> without<00:02:49.900> having<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> make<00:02:50.830> all<00:02:50.920> these

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
to here without having to make all these

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.820 
to here without having to make all these
odd<00:02:51.250> motions<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.330> wiggle<00:02:52.930> itself<00:02:53.230> so

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
odd motions right and wiggle itself so

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.220 
odd motions right and wiggle itself so
we<00:02:54.670> put<00:02:54.940> these<00:02:55.090> tables<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.900> simulate

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
we put these tables here to simulate

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.560 
we put these tables here to simulate
your<00:02:56.440> homes<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.790> your<00:02:57.970> homes<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.330> don't<00:02:58.450> have

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
your homes in your homes you don't have

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.500 
your homes in your homes you don't have
like<00:02:58.750> large<00:02:58.960> spaces<00:02:59.730> where<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.210> it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
like large spaces where you know it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.670 
like large spaces where you know it
would<00:03:01.600> be<00:03:01.690> easy<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> robot<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.440> drive

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
would be easy for a robot to drive

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.330 
would be easy for a robot to drive
around<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.280> know<00:03:03.370> we<00:03:03.910> live<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.780> messy<00:03:05.710> areas

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
around you know we live in messy areas

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.070 
around you know we live in messy areas
where<00:03:06.820> all<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.210> our<00:03:07.300> stuff<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.600> all<00:03:07.750> around<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
where all of our stuff is all around the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.910 
where all of our stuff is all around the
robot<00:03:08.320> would<00:03:08.410> have<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> figure<00:03:08.680> out<00:03:08.800> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
robot would have to figure out to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.180 
robot would have to figure out to
navigate<00:03:09.280> around<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.240> do<00:03:10.330> research<00:03:11.190> on

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
navigate around it so we do research on

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.620 
navigate around it so we do research on
these<00:03:12.460> types<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.790> problems<00:03:12.970> real<00:03:13.360> world

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
these types of problems real world

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.000 
these types of problems real world
problems<00:03:14.050> where<00:03:14.350> there's<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> lot<00:03:14.710> of<00:03:14.830> clutter

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
problems where there's a lot of clutter

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.730 
problems where there's a lot of clutter
and<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:16.060> have<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.240> figure<00:03:16.450> out<00:03:16.480> waste<00:03:16.750> motion

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
and we have to figure out waste motion

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.530 
and we have to figure out waste motion
plan<00:03:17.920> around<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.730> navigation<00:03:19.270> and<00:03:19.390> for

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
plan around that for navigation and for

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.140 
plan around that for navigation and for
manipulation<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.500> here<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.580> width<00:03:21.880> here<00:03:21.970> is

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
manipulation so here this width here is

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.620 
manipulation so here this width here is
actually<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:23.350> width<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:25.060> maybe<00:03:25.420> two

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
actually like the width like maybe two

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.600 
actually like the width like maybe two
inches<00:03:25.870> greater<00:03:26.230> than<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.070> entire<00:03:27.190> width<00:03:27.520> of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
inches greater than the entire width of

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.370 
inches greater than the entire width of
the<00:03:27.730> robot<00:03:28.060> when<00:03:28.240> it<00:03:28.360> when<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.780> has<00:03:28.900> its<00:03:29.080> arms

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
the robot when it when it has its arms

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.540 
the robot when it when it has its arms
in<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.620> tough<00:03:29.860> position

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
in this tough position

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.660 
in this tough position
so<00:03:30.910> our<00:03:31.530> planners<00:03:32.530> are<00:03:32.680> able<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.070> navigate

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
so our planners are able to navigate

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.070 
so our planners are able to navigate
simply<00:03:34.360> from<00:03:34.570> there<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.870> here<00:03:34.900> without

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
simply from there to here without

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.710 
simply from there to here without
actually<00:03:35.500> knocking<00:03:36.430> into<00:03:36.760> anything<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.480> it's

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
actually knocking into anything and it's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.570 
actually knocking into anything and it's
a<00:03:37.810> pretty<00:03:37.960> complex<00:03:38.320> problem

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
a pretty complex problem

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:49.180 
a pretty complex problem
I<00:03:40.610> got<00:03:41.330> you're<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.630> smart<00:03:41.900> one

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
so now the next thing it's going to be

and<00:04:21.750> it's<00:04:21.960> looking<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> find<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.830> flat<00:04:23.280> surface

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.910 
and it's looking to find a flat surface
which<00:04:24.060> there's<00:04:24.300> quite<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.540> bit<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.590> has<00:04:25.770> to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
which there's quite a bit but it has to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.140 
which there's quite a bit but it has to
find<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.280> place<00:04:26.490> where<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:26.760> thinks<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.120> can

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
find a place where it thinks it can

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.290 
find a place where it thinks it can
safely<00:04:27.480> put<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> object<00:04:28.320> down<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.150> flat

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
safely put the object down on a flat

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.000 
safely put the object down on a flat
surface<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.960> table<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.770> won't<00:04:31.920> hit

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
surface like a table and it won't hit

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.070 
surface like a table and it won't hit
anything

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.439 

and<00:04:37.500> now<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:37.889> generated<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.400> path<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:39.330> the

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
and now it's generated a path that the

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.330 
and now it's generated a path that the
arms<00:04:39.690> going<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:39.990> follow<00:04:40.199> in<00:04:40.470> order<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.800> get<00:04:41.250> the
