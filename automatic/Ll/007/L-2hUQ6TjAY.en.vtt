00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.790 

today<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:00.659> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.870> show<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.050> how<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.350> write

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
today I'm going to show you how to write

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.380 
today I'm going to show you how to write
any<00:00:02.190> decimal<00:00:02.760> off<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.600> four<00:00:04.020> decimal<00:00:04.259> places

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
any decimal off to four decimal places

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.670 
any decimal off to four decimal places
so<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.629> rounded<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.049> four<00:00:07.259> decimal<00:00:07.290> places

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
so if you rounded to four decimal places

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.980 
so if you rounded to four decimal places
this<00:00:08.250> means<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.790> want<00:00:09.090> four<00:00:09.510> numbers

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this means that I want four numbers

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.129 
this means that I want four numbers
after<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.769> decimal<00:00:10.860> point<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.090> let's<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.049> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
after the decimal point so let's have a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.340 
after the decimal point so let's have a
look<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.710> example<00:00:14.160> 1<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:15.750> I've<00:00:15.809> gotta<00:00:15.990> round<00:00:16.170> it

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
look at example 1 so I've gotta round it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.859 
look at example 1 so I've gotta round it
off<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.500> 4<00:00:17.100> decimal<00:00:17.460> places<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.210> when<00:00:18.510> four

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
off to 4 decimal places so when four

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.349 
off to 4 decimal places so when four
numbers<00:00:19.230> after<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> decimal<00:00:19.680> point<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:21.270> we

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
numbers after the decimal point so if we

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.220 
numbers after the decimal point so if we
count<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.960> two<00:00:22.230> three<00:00:22.970> four<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.869> we've<00:00:25.019> got<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
count one two three four so we've got to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.160 
count one two three four so we've got to
cut<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> number<00:00:25.769> off<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.869> now<00:00:27.869> we've<00:00:27.990> got

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
cut the number off here now we've got

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.130 
cut the number off here now we've got
two<00:00:28.380> choices<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.630> can<00:00:30.630> either<00:00:30.720> ran<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
two choices now I can either ran the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.380 
two choices now I can either ran the
number<00:00:31.349> down<00:00:31.529> around<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> number<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
number down around the number or if I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
number down around the number or if I
ran<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> number<00:00:33.989> down<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> they've<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
ran the number down and they've the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
ran the number down and they've the
answer<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.149> four<00:00:36.450> point<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:36.989> seven<00:00:37.290> three

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
answer is four point one seven three

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
answer is four point one seven three
five<00:00:38.390> if<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.570> ran<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> number<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.610> my<00:00:41.610> answer

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
five if I ran the number up my answer

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.690 
five if I ran the number up my answer
would<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.300> four<00:00:42.570> point<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.200> seven<00:00:43.530> three<00:00:43.950> six

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
would be four point one seven three six

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
would be four point one seven three six
you<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.090> add<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> last<00:00:46.110> digit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you just add one on to this last digit

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.580 
you just add one on to this last digit
here<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:48.180> decide<00:00:48.480> whether<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.170> round<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> up

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
here to decide whether and round it up

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
here to decide whether and round it up
or<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.789> need<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> look<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
or down we just need to look at the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.340 
or down we just need to look at the
number<00:00:51.930> after<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.559> line<00:00:53.660> now<00:00:54.660> since<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
number after the line now since it's the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
number after the line now since it's the
six<00:00:56.000> remember<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> rules<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.809> 5<00:00:57.989> or

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
six remember the rules if it's 5 or

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
six remember the rules if it's 5 or
above<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.559> round<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.949> less<00:00:59.340> than<00:00:59.550> five<00:00:59.789> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
above you round up less than five you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
above you round up less than five you
round<00:01:00.300> down<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.649> need<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> round<00:01:02.129> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
round down so we need to round this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.170 
round down so we need to round this
number<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> answer<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.280> four<00:01:05.670> point

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
number up so answer will be four point

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.740 
number up so answer will be four point
one<00:01:06.840> seven<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> change<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
one seven three just need to change that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.310 
one seven three just need to change that
last<00:01:10.080> digit<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> six<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> let's<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> look

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
last digit to a six so let's have a look

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.039 
last digit to a six so let's have a look
at<00:01:13.439> example<00:01:13.710> 2<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.939> time<00:01:15.299> we've<00:01:15.780> got

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
at example 2 then so this time we've got

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.070 
at example 2 then so this time we've got
a<00:01:16.200> longer<00:01:16.650> decimal<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> again<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
a longer decimal so I want it again to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.850 
a longer decimal so I want it again to
4dp

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
4dp

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
4dp
so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.729> count<00:01:20.909> four<00:01:21.270> numbers<00:01:21.570> after<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so if we count four numbers after the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
so if we count four numbers after the
decimal<00:01:22.020> point<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.460> three<00:01:24.270> four<00:01:25.700> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
decimal point one two three four so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
decimal point one two three four so
there's<00:01:27.090> two<00:01:27.360> possible<00:01:27.840> answers<00:01:27.900> again<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
there's two possible answers again we

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
there's two possible answers again we
can<00:01:28.979> either<00:01:29.100> leave<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.640> thirty-seven

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
can either leave it as thirty-seven

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.120 
can either leave it as thirty-seven
point<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.750> seven<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.350> eight<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.950> round

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
point two seven one eight if we round

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
point two seven one eight if we round
down<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.689> round<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.140> it'll<00:01:34.740> be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
down or if we round it up it'll be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.300 
down or if we round it up it'll be
thirty-seven<00:01:35.579> point<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:35.939> seven<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.869> nine<00:01:37.310> so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thirty-seven point two seven one nine so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
thirty-seven point two seven one nine so
again<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.820> need<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> number

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
again we just need to look at the number

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.120 
again we just need to look at the number
after<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.619> line<00:01:41.540> since<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.810> less<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.829> five

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
after the line since it's less than five

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.399 
after the line since it's less than five
if<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.490> round<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> number<00:01:45.180> downwards<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.259> we

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
if we round the number downwards so we

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.510 
if we round the number downwards so we
keep<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> same

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
keep it the same

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.630 
keep it the same
so<00:01:48.270> it'd<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.450> thirty-seven<00:01:49.439> point<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.890> seven

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so it'd be thirty-seven point two seven

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.830 
so it'd be thirty-seven point two seven
one<00:01:50.970> eight<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.810> final

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
one eight so let's look at one final

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
one eight so let's look at one final
example<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:59.280> time<00:01:59.520> we've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.700> six

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
example then and this time we've got six

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.749 
example then and this time we've got six
point<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.509> five<00:02:00.750> eight<00:02:00.990> three<00:02:01.920> five<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.159> one

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
point one five eight three five one one

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.940 
point one five eight three five one one
nine<00:02:03.000> two<00:02:03.210> four<00:02:03.450> seven<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
nine two four seven so again if we do it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.840 
nine two four seven so again if we do it
to<00:02:05.070> 4dp

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to 4dp

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.059 
to 4dp
so<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.990> four<00:02:07.290> numbers<00:02:07.619> after<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.979> decimal

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so on four numbers after the decimal

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.420 
so on four numbers after the decimal
point<00:02:09.080> we're<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.289> cut<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> off<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.129> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
point we're going to cut it off here so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
point we're going to cut it off here so
if<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.480> look<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.780> look<00:02:12.930> at<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> number

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
if we look at look at the number

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.790 
if we look at look at the number
after<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> line<00:02:14.070> which<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.520> five<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.440> since

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
after the line which is five so since

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.530 
after the line which is five so since
it's<00:02:17.010> five<00:02:17.250> above<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.820> need<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> ran<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it's five above we need to ran the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.840 
it's five above we need to ran the
number<00:02:18.900> upwards<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.070> we<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.310> need<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.520> add

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
number upwards so we just need to add

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.080 
number upwards so we just need to add
one<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.480> last<00:02:21.780> digit<00:02:22.050> here<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.880> get

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
one on to this last digit here so we get

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.310 
one on to this last digit here so we get
final<00:02:24.660> outs<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.990> six<00:02:25.350> point<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.220> five<00:02:26.700> eight

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
final outs of six point one five eight

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.540 
final outs of six point one five eight
four<00:02:29.000> thanks<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.120> watching
