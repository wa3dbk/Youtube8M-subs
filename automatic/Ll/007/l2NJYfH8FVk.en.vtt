00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.960
 This is the first tutorial place in the structure that supports a 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.440
 zero point 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.130

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.150
 I'll say no 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 with the result on Wednesdays and already begins with much emphasis on the height already changed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.999
 very rainy than normal graphic 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.769
 and then exceeded 18 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.770
 some changes but initially the flight already to pass the commands nÃ© 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.620
 that a lot of people are doubtful about it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.760
 some commands that have changed a lot 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.320
 3por4 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 good first in shock the pictures 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.270
 We'll come and read with me. 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.980
 three points 0 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.300
 milliband 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.800
 kid rock 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.670
 He is going to raise Carol. 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 we wanted the side that will get hurt after cutting 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 we see here in this tool that by cultured norm 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.199
 and she now wants to pass 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.549
 from side to side that neither the workout and I'm here falls on top and it will not 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.730
 give it to people 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.510
 the satin cut where you go out 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.830
 we see this I am part of 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.010
 Theo says that now 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.010
 in some parts 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.630
 and not only when in a partially ready dinner there nÃ© 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.660
 was also cut to imposing he was with a sharp 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.630
 W 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.940
 another function is that this occurs so far has not 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.040
 is the function of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.370
 the test is often half 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.640
 jaqueline sai c 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.920
 and create the marvel comics studios 0 separated 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.719
 little changed today 8 that cover them space 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.730
 currently discovering 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.450
 museum comes here in leiria 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.170
 the cart full of leaving first 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 main aliases 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 you see here in terms of leisure taipei 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 Do you know if you would have it here? 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.119
 and the good cure that now dimension gauging the polished marine wheels 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.450
 has posted 0 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 they finish fine 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.969
 here you will not even move do not forget with the same name 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.759
 blair which is an act like 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.239
 for now an extra reason 14 05 gives them more of the vinci with 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.619
 pedro stammered 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.319
 and you're going to the field 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.109
 then that created the comics so with the new c3 only that here live in front 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.199
 you can see that in the year in the quim quim 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.529
 he created a pastry for each comic 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.579
 this means that now in the hand of the acronym the four can put everything that 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.509
 said 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.659
 separately by law 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.109
 each led to the pastinha team you put davis herbie of balloons few 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.359
 images 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.319
 P 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.500
 another 3 billion 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 it gets messy 3 it's going to be all together 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.369
 so he just was not number one we did here 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.209
 but we must not forget but Pedro was Miret then he knows it is in this 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.639
 phase that 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.229
 We will enter here. 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.589
 let's see 1 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.399
 To gaspar here 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:12.609
 another difference 2 3 prof 4 is that you can not delete the maximums will 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.859
 end up with funds for the most diverse 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.309
 You can not speak more easily. 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:18.779
 if you coming 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.279
 the first step after incorporating margin 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.279
 It is one of per se because it did not want new entourage names 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.479
 good here you can not erase the profit margins and maybe do not turn off 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.279
 the edges when you went to work 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.129
 quietly 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.189
 have the comic without the fear of picking up the knits 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.689
 suddenly ccc rudin de dilma while reading here for her father uk 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.139
 main you can delete everything 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.139
 without erasing the navies there 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.639
 now simply good people can work here 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.220
 and he reminding everyone that red 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.709
 he will cut 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.399
 in the quota of pis and corn 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.809
 the story here the next day 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.809
 and we can by disloyal act of the cute little front 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.840
 then you can continue to edit the panels it is difficult for you to 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.469
 diverse 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.919
 in the next hour I go because of the success there like 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.370
 put the characters 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.199
 only work of balloons 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.879
 good to see them first studio lesson of the projects from August to July 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.959
 is the section my blog mendes rui duarte yet another point with 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.040
 village of count 12 dilma rousseff and also missing the side the team you 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:32.650
 it's going 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.849
 having busy and password 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.120
 some things to 0 in racing racks 4 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.089
 hard to pass on vegetation in sight passing en masse initiated by me 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.939
 little damage aside
