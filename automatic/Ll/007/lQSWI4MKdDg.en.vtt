to visit you to ask you archery
questions<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> I've<00:00:50.730> got<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> long<00:00:51.270> list<00:00:51.600> I'll

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
questions and I've got a long list I'll

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.650 
questions and I've got a long list I'll
just<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.850> triangular<00:00:53.850> heads<00:00:54.120> versus

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
just start triangular heads versus

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
just start triangular heads versus
diamond<00:00:55.230> heads<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.520> myself<00:00:56.760> more<00:00:57.329> partial

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
diamond heads I find myself more partial

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
diamond heads I find myself more partial
to<00:00:57.930> triangular<00:00:58.770> heads<00:00:58.980> aesthetically<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
to triangular heads aesthetically but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
to triangular heads aesthetically but
the<00:01:00.449> diamond<00:01:00.930> heads<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> special<00:01:02.190> way<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the diamond heads have a special way of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.850 
the diamond heads have a special way of
cutting<00:01:02.850> through<00:01:03.059> meet<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.930> hurled<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.589> prey

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
cutting through meet when hurled at prey

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.969 
cutting through meet when hurled at prey
and<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.299> wondering<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and so I'm wondering if you think that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
and so I'm wondering if you think that
one<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.970> identity<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.570> only

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
one has to have an identity with only

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
one has to have an identity with only
triangular<00:01:10.799> heads<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.700> guessing<00:01:12.180> you're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
triangular heads or I'm guessing you're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
triangular heads or I'm guessing you're
from<00:01:12.570> Minnesota<00:01:12.860> yes<00:01:13.860> absolutely<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.760> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
from Minnesota yes absolutely well then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
from Minnesota yes absolutely well then
you're<00:01:15.210> obviously<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> diamond<00:01:16.710> camp

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you're obviously from the diamond camp

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
you're obviously from the diamond camp
see<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> triangular<00:01:18.450> head<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
see a triangular head is more for the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
see a triangular head is more for the
meats<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> you'll<00:01:20.100> find<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.580> southern

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
meats that you'll find in the southern

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
meats that you'll find in the southern
regions<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.290> north<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.610> they

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
regions and up north there where they

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
regions and up north there where they
use<00:01:24.049> diamond<00:01:25.049> heads<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.560> cut<00:01:25.770> things<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> elk

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
use diamond heads to cut things like elk

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
use diamond heads to cut things like elk
and<00:01:27.030> beaver<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.500> yes<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.460> diamond

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and beaver then yes we would use diamond

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.200 
and beaver then yes we would use diamond
heads<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.540> both<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:31.110> very<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:32.159> valid<00:01:32.640> forms

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
heads but both are very very valid forms

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.800 
heads but both are very very valid forms
of<00:01:34.400> arrowheads<00:01:35.400> when<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> diamond<00:01:36.630> head

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of arrowheads when the diamond head

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
of arrowheads when the diamond head
pierces<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> beaver<00:01:37.860> though<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> beaver

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pierces the beaver though the beaver

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420 
pierces the beaver though the beaver
shrinks<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:40.290> often<00:01:40.560> wondered<00:01:40.950> if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
shrinks and I've often wondered if

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.020 
shrinks and I've often wondered if
that's<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> surprise<00:01:43.280> or<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that's out of surprise or out of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's out of surprise or out of
distress<00:01:45.630> well<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> could<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
distress well and could it be the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.670 
distress well and could it be the
distress<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.909> surprise<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.409> headed

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
distress of surprise like I was headed

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.580 
distress of surprise like I was headed
to<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.920> Book<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> Month<00:01:50.880> meeting<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
have to go to the beaver doctor instead

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
have to go to the beaver doctor instead
I<00:01:55.530> meant<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> nice<00:01:56.579> way

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I meant that in a nice way

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.200 
I meant that in a nice way
but<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.500> when<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.979> first<00:01:59.280> hit<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> beaver<00:01:59.939> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
but but when it first hit the beaver and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.039 
but but when it first hit the beaver and
