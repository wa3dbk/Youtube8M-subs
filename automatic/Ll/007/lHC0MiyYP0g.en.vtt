00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
come from trades because I am in a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
come from trades because I am in a
different<00:01:46.290> part<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> country<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
different part of the country and I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
different part of the country and I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
like like maybe I'll cover like all the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.420 
like like maybe I'll cover like all the
racing<00:02:25.170> games<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> particular<00:02:26.010> system<00:02:26.220> or

racing games for a particular system or
something<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
something like that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.880 
something like that
and<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.600> sucks<00:02:27.900> when<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.710> one

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and it sucks when I don't have that one

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.490 
and it sucks when I don't have that one
game<00:02:29.130> right<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> games<00:02:31.230> but

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
game right so I have all the games but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650 
game right so I have all the games but
that<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.460> wish<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.120> had<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
that one it's like I wish I had that and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.570 
that one it's like I wish I had that and
I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.260> key<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> your<00:02:35.040> question<00:02:35.430> was

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
I think the the key to your question was

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.390 
I think the the key to your question was
cheap<00:02:36.180> right<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> don't<00:02:37.980> take<00:02:38.190> chances

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
cheap right and now I don't take chances

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
cheap right and now I don't take chances
with<00:02:38.760> games<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:39.900> expensive

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
with games that are really expensive

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.190 
with games that are really expensive
especially<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.520> they<00:02:41.610> suck<00:02:41.930> again<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.080> not

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
especially if they suck again I'm not

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.660 
especially if they suck again I'm not
going<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> complete<00:02:43.980> collection<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.460> have

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
going for a complete collection you have

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.130 
going for a complete collection you have
done<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.120> past<00:02:45.150> where<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.600> had<00:02:45.960> to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
done that in the past where you had to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.890 
done that in the past where you had to
put<00:02:46.800> down<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.100> money<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.270> last<00:02:48.600> couple

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
put down the money for that last couple

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.320 
put down the money for that last couple
games<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.670> necessary<00:02:51.240> your

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
games and it's not necessary your

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.640 
games and it's not necessary your
favorite<00:02:51.660> right<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.050> what<00:02:52.290> game<00:02:52.470> I'll

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
favorite right or what game I'll

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
favorite right or what game I'll
probably<00:02:53.100> never<00:02:53.310> play<00:02:53.640> out<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> may<00:02:54.180> test<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
probably never play out I may test it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.780 
probably never play out I may test it
but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.080> pretty<00:02:55.680> much<00:02:55.770> I'm<00:02:56.040> having<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.550> for

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but I pretty much I'm having it for

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.030 
but I pretty much I'm having it for
historical<00:02:57.420> purposes<00:02:57.480> saying<00:02:58.290> yeah<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.800> have

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
historical purposes saying yeah I have

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.530 
historical purposes saying yeah I have
this<00:02:59.220> game<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.610> my<00:02:59.640> collection<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.270> it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
this game in my collection because it

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.870 
this game in my collection because it
completes<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> set<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.700> showcase

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
completes the set and I want to showcase

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.050 
completes the set and I want to showcase
every<00:03:03.600> game<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.590> system<00:03:04.980> has<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
every game that that system has and and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.430 
every game that that system has and and
another<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.990> thought<00:03:07.050> about<00:03:07.110> too

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
another thing I just thought about too

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.400 
another thing I just thought about too
was<00:03:07.770> games<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.790> complete<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.240> box<00:03:09.410> those

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
was games that are complete in box those

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.600 
was games that are complete in box those
are<00:03:10.560> becoming<00:03:10.830> at<00:03:11.100> least<00:03:11.280> my<00:03:11.550> experience

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
are becoming at least my experience

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.430 
are becoming at least my experience
experienced<00:03:12.390> really<00:03:12.570> hard<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.840> find<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.290> so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
experienced really hard to find and so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
experienced really hard to find and so
sometimes<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.850> find<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.270> game<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.480> is

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
sometimes if I find the game that is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.570 
sometimes if I find the game that is
completing<00:03:16.200> box<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.710> it's<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.100> necessarily

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
completing box and it's not necessarily

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.030 
completing box and it's not necessarily
rare<00:03:18.240> or<00:03:18.570> expensive<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.500> completed<00:03:19.980> in

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
rare or expensive but it's completed in

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.760 
rare or expensive but it's completed in
the<00:03:20.100> box<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.610> looks<00:03:20.640> beautiful<00:03:21.560> yeah<00:03:22.560> I'll
