00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.690 

we're<00:00:32.020> talking<00:00:32.380> about<00:00:32.500> rhythm<00:00:32.950> we're<00:00:33.550> going

applying<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.250> eighth<00:00:45.520> notes<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:55.660> going

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
applying it to eighth notes we're going

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.479 
applying it to eighth notes we're going
to<00:00:55.870> kind<00:00:56.080> of<00:00:56.199> look<00:00:56.530> under<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:56.980> hood<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.220> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
to kind of look under the hood and the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.700 
to kind of look under the hood and the
triplet<00:00:58.000> really<00:00:58.390> explore<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.960> in<00:00:59.020> depth<00:00:59.320> today

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
triplet really explore it in depth today

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.639
