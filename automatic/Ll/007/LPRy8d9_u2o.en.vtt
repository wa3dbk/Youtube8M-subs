00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.790 

we're<00:00:18.330> trying<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> replicate<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.380> food<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we're trying to replicate the food of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
we're trying to replicate the food of
the<00:00:19.830> fish<00:00:20.160> rate<00:00:20.550> either<00:00:20.910> through<00:00:21.300> dry<00:00:21.570> flies

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the fish rate either through dry flies

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
the fish rate either through dry flies
and<00:00:22.140> imps<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.560> streamers<00:00:23.100> are<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.180> three

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and imps or streamers are the three

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
and imps or streamers are the three
basic<00:00:24.900> things<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:27.920> things<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.340> or

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
basic things like things like this or

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.930 
basic things like things like this or
dry<00:00:29.910> flies<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.539> gonna<00:00:30.689> float<00:00:31.640> like<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
dry flies they're gonna float like that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
dry flies they're gonna float like that
say<00:00:34.219> it's<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> top<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
say it's in the top and they go down to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.580 
say it's in the top and they go down to
every<00:00:37.890> size<00:00:38.210> imaginable<00:00:39.210> okay<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
every size imaginable okay we put a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
every size imaginable okay we put a
little<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> hack<00:00:41.790> I'll<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
little this on the hack I'll see this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.389 
little this on the hack I'll see this
here<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.610> silicone<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:46.280> then<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
here it's like a silicone and then it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
here it's like a silicone and then it
comes<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.879> spray<00:00:48.239> bottles<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
comes in spray bottles or this I like to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.970 
comes in spray bottles or this I like to
do<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> way<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> gets<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.980> more

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
do it this way I think it gets on more

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
do it this way I think it gets on more
where<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> spray<00:00:53.579> bottle<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.149> goes<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
where a spray bottle just goes in the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
where a spray bottle just goes in the
air<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.469> soaked<00:00:59.070> up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
air a lot so that will not soaked up

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400 
air a lot so that will not soaked up
some<00:00:59.309> water<00:00:59.789> now<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.480> stay<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> little

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
some water now I'm gonna stay a little

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.359 
some water now I'm gonna stay a little
longer

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.890 

why<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.430> people<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.750> it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
why do people do a lot of that if it's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
why do people do a lot of that if it's
on<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> dry<00:01:07.470> fly<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.670> drying<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> fly

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
on a dry fly you're drying the fly

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
on a dry fly you're drying the fly
because<00:01:10.200> no<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> fly<00:01:10.860> supposed<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> float<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
because no the fly supposed to float I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
because no the fly supposed to float I
personally<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.549> few<00:01:14.970> strokes<00:01:15.390> as

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
personally like as few strokes as

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
personally like as few strokes as
possible<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.340> wet<00:01:17.580> fly<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> nymph<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
possible if it's a wet fly a nymph or a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
possible if it's a wet fly a nymph or a
streamer<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> pick<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.790> one

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
streamer I like to pick it up in one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.719 
streamer I like to pick it up in one
time<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> fly<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> stay<00:01:23.340> wet

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
time because I want to fly to stay wet

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.859 
time because I want to fly to stay wet
so<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.479> sink<00:01:24.869> right<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.479> or<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> kept

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so it will sink right now or if you kept

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
so it will sink right now or if you kept
with<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.439> dry<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> fly<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.100> I'm

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
with me you're gonna dry the fly out I'm

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
with me you're gonna dry the fly out I'm
just<00:01:29.369> gonna<00:01:29.579> float<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> top<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.930> often<00:01:31.290> do

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
just gonna float on the top how often do

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.450 
just gonna float on the top how often do
you<00:01:31.500> recast<00:01:31.950> Oh<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.610> dry<00:01:33.390> flight<00:01:34.280> today<00:01:35.280> we're

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you recast Oh a dry flight today we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.649 
you recast Oh a dry flight today we're
going<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> river

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
going down the river

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.600 
going down the river
and<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> nice<00:01:37.890> place<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and we put it in a nice place now the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
and we put it in a nice place now the
currents<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.329> eventually<00:01:39.780> pull<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> fly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
currents gonna eventually pull that fly

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
currents gonna eventually pull that fly
downward<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> gonna<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.570> dragging<00:01:42.899> there

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
downward this is gonna be dragging there

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530 
downward this is gonna be dragging there
at<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.890> point<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> dry<00:01:44.970> fly<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.450> would

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
at that point it was a dry fly you would

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
at that point it was a dry fly you would
pick<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.049> maybe<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
pick it up maybe we would put a little

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
pick it up maybe we would put a little
few<00:01:47.909> times<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> dry<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.770> put<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
few times just to dry it and then put it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.860 
few times just to dry it and then put it
back<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.630 

okay<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.050> main<00:01:54.350> thing<00:01:54.650> now<00:01:54.860> Kara<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.460> we're

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
okay the main thing now Kara is we're

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.910 
okay the main thing now Kara is we're
going<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.790> keep<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.180> film<00:01:56.480> on<00:01:56.630> top<00:01:56.900> but<00:01:57.740> I

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
going to keep that film on top but I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.050 
going to keep that film on top but I
think<00:01:58.160> it's<00:01:58.280> very<00:01:58.430> important<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:58.910> that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
think it's very important to get that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.670 
think it's very important to get that
because<00:01:59.300> your<00:01:59.420> thumb<00:01:59.660> is<00:01:59.810> kind<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.080> sensitive

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
because your thumb is kind of sensitive

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.470 
because your thumb is kind of sensitive
and<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.860> lets<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.220> know<00:02:01.250> when<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.790> add<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
and it lets you know when to add a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.660 
and it lets you know when to add a
little<00:02:02.840> pressure<00:02:03.230> to<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.740> stroke<00:02:04.100> or<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.550> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
little pressure to the stroke or to the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.450 
little pressure to the stroke or to the
rot<00:02:05.080> okay<00:02:06.080> now<00:02:06.230> as<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:06.470> pick<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:06.830> up<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.310> like

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
rot okay now as we pick this up I like

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.630 
rot okay now as we pick this up I like
to<00:02:07.490> keep<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:07.970> left<00:02:08.570> hand<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:09.050> here<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.649> as<00:02:10.490> we

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
to keep this left hand up here and as we

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
to keep this left hand up here and as we
pick<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.000> up<00:02:11.180> we're<00:02:11.420> gonna<00:02:11.540> give<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.020> a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
pick this up we're gonna give this a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.050 
pick this up we're gonna give this a
little<00:02:12.380> bit<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.770> pull<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.310> what<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.760> does

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
little bit of a pull to what that does

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.390 
little bit of a pull to what that does
it<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.420> multiplies<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.380> line<00:02:15.620> speed<00:02:16.420> now

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it it multiplies the line speed now

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.280 
it it multiplies the line speed now
let's<00:02:19.400> try<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.700> see<00:02:20.210> what<00:02:20.330> happens<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.810> you're

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
let's try it see what happens if you're

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.410 
let's try it see what happens if you're
gonna<00:02:21.380> stop<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.010> ride<00:02:22.160> at<00:02:22.340> 12<00:02:22.640> o'clock<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.270> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
gonna stop the ride at 12 o'clock in it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.080 
gonna stop the ride at 12 o'clock in it
work<00:02:24.410> stroke<00:02:25.150> okay<00:02:27.130> that's<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.310> too<00:02:28.520> bad<00:02:28.790> it's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
work stroke okay that's not too bad it's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.360 
work stroke okay that's not too bad it's
important<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.630> we<00:02:29.840> stop<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.410> at<00:02:30.560> 12<00:02:30.890> o'clock

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
important that we stop it at 12 o'clock

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
important that we stop it at 12 o'clock
but<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.850> can<00:02:32.030> drift<00:02:32.360> back<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:33.050> but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
but we can drift back a little but

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.080 
but we can drift back a little but
momentarily<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.250> splits<00:02:34.550> like<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.850> want<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
momentarily it splits like you want to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.060 
momentarily it splits like you want to
stop<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.200> what<00:02:36.410> we're<00:02:36.530> trying<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.920> is

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
stop it and what we're trying to do is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.820 
stop it and what we're trying to do is
keep<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.430> real<00:02:37.730> tight<00:02:38.120> level<00:02:38.630> line<00:02:38.900> behind<00:02:39.590> us

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
keep a real tight level line behind us

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.220 
keep a real tight level line behind us
so<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> think<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> person<00:02:41.570> should<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:41.990> at

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
so I think what the person should do at

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.320 
so I think what the person should do at
first<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.739> get<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.730> habit<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.120> turning

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
first is get in the habit of turning

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.240 
first is get in the habit of turning
your<00:02:44.600> head<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.080> look<00:02:45.260> at<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.620> line<00:02:45.920> back

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
your head and look at that line back

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.110 
your head and look at that line back
there<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.820> see<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:47.660> going<00:02:48.020> out<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:49.120> try

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
there and see that it's going out I try

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.060 
there and see that it's going out I try
not<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.420> put<00:02:50.570> jerks<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.320> smoother<00:02:51.860> you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
not to put jerks in it the smoother you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.920 
not to put jerks in it the smoother you
do<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:53.060> better<00:02:53.209> that's<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.630> going<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
do this the better that's all going to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.330 
do this the better that's all going to
cast<00:02:54.440> gonna<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.330> go<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:58.010> outweighs

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
cast gonna be there you go it outweighs

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.300 
cast gonna be there you go it outweighs
that<00:02:58.519> one<00:02:58.640> out<00:02:58.760> front<00:02:59.030> carry<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.930> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that one out front carry here is a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.860 
that one out front carry here is a
casting<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.640> lawn<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.239> she's<00:03:02.510> laying

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
casting on the lawn and she's laying

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.020 
casting on the lawn and she's laying
that<00:03:03.019> line<00:03:03.260> out<00:03:03.440> pretty<00:03:03.680> nice<00:03:03.950> next<00:03:04.760> step

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
that line out pretty nice next step

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.729 
that line out pretty nice next step
would<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.390> get<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.930> water<00:03:06.170> where<00:03:06.470> fish

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
would be to get in the water where fish

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:17.510 
would be to get in the water where fish
live<00:03:12.610> things<00:03:13.610> are<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:13.940> taller<00:03:14.209> than<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.570> am

there's some grass fights out there

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.520 
there's some grass fights out there
pretty<00:03:42.890> darn<00:03:43.280> reasonable<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.239> $50<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:47.530> for

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
pretty darn reasonable like $50 and for

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.890 
pretty darn reasonable like $50 and for
like<00:03:48.680> $100<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.760> could<00:03:49.940> get<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> whole<00:03:50.450> outfit

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.690 

then<00:03:59.900> after<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.830> really<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.370> fishing

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
then after you really get fishing

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.400 
then after you really get fishing
there's<00:04:02.030> other<00:04:02.239> things<00:04:02.360> we<00:04:02.780> want<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.110> really

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
there's other things we want it really

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.190 
there's other things we want it really
to<00:04:03.739> land<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.340> water<00:04:04.550> with<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.330> curve<00:04:05.750> in<00:04:06.080> it

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
to land on the water with a curve in it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.890 
to land on the water with a curve in it
because<00:04:06.620> basically<00:04:06.920> fish<00:04:07.640> are<00:04:08.480> looking

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
because basically fish are looking

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.309 
because basically fish are looking
upstream<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.880> want<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.390> line<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.690> flow

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
upstream and you want that line to flow

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.580 
upstream and you want that line to flow
over<00:04:12.700> which<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.850> fly<00:04:14.120> over<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.019> side<00:04:15.290> of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
over which the fly over to the side of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:31.339 
over which the fly over to the side of
the<00:04:15.709> mainline

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.260 

if<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.530> were<00:04:32.650> never<00:04:33.099> hit<00:04:33.400> fish<00:04:33.669> before<00:04:34.150> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
if you were never hit fish before and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.520 
if you were never hit fish before and
you<00:04:34.360> just<00:04:34.389> went<00:04:34.659> and<00:04:34.810> bought<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.020> rigging<00:04:35.409> this

you just went and bought a rigging this

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.920 
you just went and bought a rigging this
started<00:04:36.039> out<00:04:36.159> you<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.389> will<00:04:37.539> bury<00:04:37.750> with

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
started out you know this will bury with
