00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
let you play around with the properties

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.439 
let you play around with the properties
of<00:00:19.380> player<00:00:20.039> traits<00:00:20.340> inside<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> specific

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of player traits inside of a specific

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.460 
of player traits inside of a specific
zone<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.380> create<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:24.050> make<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
basically you can find trade zones under

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
basically you can find trade zones under
the<00:00:28.050> gadgets<00:00:28.410> menu<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> they<00:00:29.460> cost<00:00:29.640> 50<00:00:30.000> bucks

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the gadgets menu and they cost 50 bucks

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
the gadgets menu and they cost 50 bucks
which<00:00:30.779> isn't<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.800> bad<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.340> um<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.410> 15

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
top of each other so in this trade zone

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
top of each other so in this trade zone
it's<00:00:50.700> set<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:50.969> alpha<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.129> with<00:00:53.129> trade<00:00:53.340> zones

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I have a set to alpha and the Alpha

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.450 
I have a set to alpha and the Alpha
traits<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:06.270> hundred<00:01:06.540> percent<00:01:06.810> jump<00:01:07.460> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
traits are two hundred percent jump so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
traits are two hundred percent jump so
yeah<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> cool<00:01:09.390> things<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
with them and two hundred percent jump

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.800 
with them and two hundred percent jump
is<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:14.130> jump<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.000> high<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
is we jump to about this high as I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
is we jump to about this high as I
haven't<00:01:16.110> worked<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> block<00:01:17.490> right

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
haven't worked out for this block right

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
haven't worked out for this block right
here<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.820> took<00:01:23.880> another<00:01:24.810> trade

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
here and now if I took another trade

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.670 
here and now if I took another trade
zone<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.490> add<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.299> same<00:01:27.540> traits<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
zone so add the same traits you have a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
zone so add the same traits you have a
set<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> Alpha<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> everything<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.350> it's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
set the Alpha and everything and it's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
set the Alpha and everything and it's
the<00:01:31.530> same<00:01:31.680> exact<00:01:32.009> size<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> same

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the same exact size it's in the same

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
the same exact size it's in the same
exact<00:01:34.439> place<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.540> hundred

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
exact place and it's at two hundred

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.490 
exact place and it's at two hundred
percent<00:01:37.049> jump<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.409> well<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> still<00:01:39.570> stays<00:01:40.140> at

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
percent jump as well it still stays at

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
percent jump as well it still stays at
two<00:01:40.619> hundred<00:01:40.710> percent<00:01:41.159> jump<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
two hundred percent jump it doesn't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.219 
two hundred percent jump it doesn't
double<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> four<00:01:42.479> hundred<00:01:42.540> percent<00:01:43.020> jump

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
double up to four hundred percent jump

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
double up to four hundred percent jump
you<00:01:44.070> continuously<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.630> same<00:01:45.869> amount

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you continuously have the same amount

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
you continuously have the same amount
you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.530> eyes<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.640> three<00:01:47.820> hundred

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can eyes you can go as three hundred

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
you can eyes you can go as three hundred
percent<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.280> that's<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> change<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
percent and that's when you change the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.130 
percent and that's when you change the
traits<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> menu<00:01:52.640> okay<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:55.110> next

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
traits from the menu okay so the next

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
traits from the menu okay so the next
trade<00:01:55.560> zone<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.969> same

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
trade zone we have here it's the same

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
trade zone we have here it's the same
exact<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.689> pretty<00:01:57.899> much<00:01:57.990> only<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.649> I'm

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
exact thing pretty much only with I'm

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
exact thing pretty much only with I'm
running<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.729> here<00:02:00.479> player<00:02:00.810> movement<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.780> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
running or here player movement and it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.109 
running or here player movement and it's
set<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> 150<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.000> it
