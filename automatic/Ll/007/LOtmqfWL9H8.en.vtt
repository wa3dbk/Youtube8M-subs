00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.540
 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:24.910
 how to change in usb extraction 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:28.140
 our control of xbox 360 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 here in the materials 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.740
 obviously a control of xbox 360 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.490
 wired 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.490
 a usb cable 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.470
 and you were 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 as well 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 this year 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.540
 I do not show the following 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.750
 materials why not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.750
 I do not have them I'm finished 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 you can do it at home 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.210
 will be able 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.360
 when some new 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.270
 the cables can release it 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.420
 I do because I have good the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.400
 scissors was to cut the wires 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.460
 I do not do it because I've already done it 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 build and will also serve to take away 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.880
 a cover 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.780
 so 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.060
 as I have done it 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.689
 what we will do is join them 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.689
 A) Yes 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.280
 here and she attached the cables you 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.790
 here they will put a tin droplet to 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 each 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.080
 so that it does not come loose and with the tape 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.360
 Insulate roll up when we are already 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.260
 already imposed the tin roll we have 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 and we will cover our cables 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 already when we have covered the four 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260
 cables 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 we will unite everything and deliver it on tape 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.270
 insulator so you do not look 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.270
 we do not get entangled in them 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.150
