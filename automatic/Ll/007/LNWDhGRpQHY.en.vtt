00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.970
 very well 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.670
 why are we going 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
 d 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.560
 now congratulations for the here in front 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 congratulations for the victory always 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 you say that the results are important 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 but that you are more concerned about how you play 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.770
 the team as you have seen the players 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 and especially how have you seen the second 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.250
 part 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.740
 I do not think it 's a day to give us the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.170
 congratulations for nothing even for 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.519
 win 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.829
 The only thing we have done is better than 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.450
 almería has been to have more clarity of 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.220
 face to goal 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.060
 that also in the fire is worth 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.380
 but the sensations are not even remotely 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.340
 good and regular not even bad 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.340
 I tried mine 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.040
 we have not known about everything after 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.190
 that has been put up until a lot 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.510
 hit the team was fine but to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.570
 from something we must enter a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 dynamics of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.500
 of losing the ball when the Almería did not 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.390
 tightened with a technical level more proper 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.710
 third edition that first 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.990
 too many impressions by a team that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.820
 play like us 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.890
 there is always some second afternoon always 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.649
 thinking second afternoon always leaving 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.010
 the extent that you take the first the first 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.200
 decision 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.840
 at times it is true that we have known 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.490
 suffer a lot that is also important 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.470
 evaluate the players nothing is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.240
 recriminates in that aspect but many 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.040
 Sometimes we go too late in football 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 you have to anticipate not being faster 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 of legs but being faster than 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.550
 head 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.720
 so good then 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.720
 I believe that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.110
 that the good victory will be 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.330
 important for them they are 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.280
 happy to give me not I do not want to see 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.480
 my team as I've seen it today and I'm going to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.360
 do everything possible so that he does not return 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.380
 to occur, it is necessary to detect what it is that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.940
 has been able to pass what what is 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.990
 happening and try to take solutions and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.030
 I think this is what I have to do 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100
 the radio is placed seventh to five 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 points of Malaga that he lost yesterday 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.649
 goal of the ray is to stay in 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 problems 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.379
 we can not have a single option 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.679
 but it's the goal of lightning how it's going 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.679
 good 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.300
 if we improve and we are the team of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.819
 two weeks three weeks or weeks 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.410
 we can 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.990
 because the power does not sound very good 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.840
 we can but as we have competed 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.530
 how we played and our nation of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.530
 to become seventh 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.050
 through the change mount the party 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.890
 against madrid the week god 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.890
 that is, truths 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.580
 s 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.329
 and today 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.130
 but not 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.500
 against Madrid and against others 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.909
 equipment and we have lowered our best 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.260
 that we had unless it's a team 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.900
 It is always very competitive in the pressure 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.849
 of the ball and how we play when 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.079
 there is a player does not need to be 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.519
 all with fingers that do not arrive on time 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.469
 we've been carrying more everything starts to come out more 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.629
 you do not have to try that Beijing forward 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.799
 to get back that meter that 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.659
 we always have an advantage with respect 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.829
 on the contrary because we thought before not 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.120
 because we were faster to contract not 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.340
 because we thought before the opposing 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.260
 we could arrive to return again to 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.650
 that everything fits and everything works like 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.909
 as is proper then good because 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.750
 really that's my job not to find 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.920
 solutions find roads and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.920
 and I'm willing to do it of course 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.910
 If there is no more to play, they will not get any more 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.600
 the shirts of this team 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.980
 that's something I'm going to talk to them 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.280
 but if I understand that a player does not 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.870
 relaxation not the word a relaxation 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.460
 he has already given me everything he has in these 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.620
 33 days already has nothing else for 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.480
 give me 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.069
 I will thank you I will be 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.170
 eternally grateful for everything 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.390
 He has given us but he will not play again 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.150
 until it is again in 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.349
 conditions if that is the case if you do not 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.030
 it's just a matter of relationship 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.739
 the current one for repeating that I think that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.900
 there are the shots that we are 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.419
 running out of gas 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.739
 to take care of it to recover it like that if 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.290
 they can give us 90 minutes they can give us 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.090
 20 then 20 but look for other solutions 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.320
 I think the moment now that over 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.430
 all the people who usually have not 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.350
 come playing until now 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.759
 claim and because it gives me the feeling 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.000
 that they are going to start having opportunities 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.000
 all 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.590
 today I have not shown at any level in 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.270
 against is possibly the one that worse 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.580
 it was within level not only for her 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.940
 it was mine that was below the level 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.990
 cold 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.910
 because we have to have 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.680
 small teams to compete with 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.170
 a fantastic level and if there are people who 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.180
 for whatever it is you can no longer what it is that 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.620
 I have to do with them and see if they do not 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.060
 because he does not have anything else to give me 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.320
 because I know that I am very demanding and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.820
 I know that they even end up guts 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.950
 many of those who there and maybe not 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.750
 they have nothing else for these six parties 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.490
 because that's a template happens now 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.470
 who has played 33 games that 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.300
 rest and the one who only played 7 then 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.860
 that you have minutes and that you can play 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.830
 but we have to go back to 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.540
 raise that competitive level go back to 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.780
 have the feeling that everything 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.700
 is in the field they go to 100% of that 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.250
 we arrived on time that we are not late 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.409
 always because we are a team 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.899
 how good we saw cattle because 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.560
 but if we play like that especially with 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:38.430
 what comes to us now would be valence what 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.430
 everything is going to be bad 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.909
 yes of course my most sincere 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.909
 Congratulations 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.020
 it's a victory and a championship that 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.029
 has deserved the first game where 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.039
 shown to be great competitors 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.659
 playing very well 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.979
 my image will be good not only to the team 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.199
 but also of course to the team 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.900
 technical led by diego media in 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.550
 phenomenal work occasions and to which I 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.370
 I predict 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.960
 a great way as a coach and I was 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.210
 very satisfied very satisfied because 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.350
 get first with the good teams 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.490
 the great teams that are in that 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:26.370
 division is very very difficult and that for a 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.710
 side says two things first the great 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.990
 health the good health that our 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.450
 quarry and second that I think there 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.250
 players that if they continue like this inside 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.600
 little can they be in the first 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.490
 team and giving us joy encourages 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.320
 creation have given in the juvenile 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.510
 giving anything where now we and 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.800
 that my image will be good again to 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.700
 enjoy it a little and continue 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.129
 working because I think that still 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.869
 they have homework ahead 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.869
 My team's work hours 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.210
 yes yes 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.640
 little by little he will find himself better 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.870
 that we can take hold because the game 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.640
 that a player who did not have cool comes 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.650
 a lot of competitive punishment throughout 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.750
 the year with which can be a good 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.660
 option the weirdo who was in vigo to me 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.130
 I liked 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.050
 and I think he has given us a little 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.670
 I put aside the goal he has given us a 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.870
 little bit of tranquility has given us a 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.660
 little bit of exposure man balloon 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.400
 playing behind that area of ​​manucho 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.130
 I think it's there you can find 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.350
 comfortable and good because it is not an option 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.400
 especially because of the fact that not only 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.490
 he is finding himself better and better 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.140
 but I think it has little punishment 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.880
 physical with which is that what 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.640
 we need now they are cool people of 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.410
 people with spark and people who can 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.240
 can give us what so far 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.160
 all have contributed so there was no 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.300
 no no complaints about the 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.320
 effect otherwise I think our 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.360
 players and have always been characterized 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.460
 for something it has been for a great attitude 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.860
 a great professionalism and that's not 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.270
 doubt absolutely nobody but 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.840
 we need good people, we need 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.450
 sparks 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.740
 let's try to find what we have
