not<00:01:55.229> absolutely<00:01:55.680> i'm<00:01:56.009> sure<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.580> time<00:01:56.850> she

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
not absolutely i'm sure the time she

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.249 
not absolutely i'm sure the time she
would<00:01:57.179> be<00:01:57.299> able<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.720> then<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.080> talk<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
would be able to go on then and talk a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
would be able to go on then and talk a
little<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.560> further<00:01:58.679> about<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.100> she<00:01:59.250> did<00:01:59.280> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
little bit further about what she did so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.969 
little bit further about what she did so
and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.210> you'd<00:02:00.360> run<00:02:00.539> off<00:02:02.509> well<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.799> one

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and then you'd run off well i think one

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.169 
and then you'd run off well i think one
of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> consistent<00:02:05.579> themes<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.970> our

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
of the consistent themes with our

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.910 
of the consistent themes with our
segment<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.869> elevator<00:02:07.200> pitching<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.649> always

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
segment on elevator pitching is always

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.499 
segment on elevator pitching is always
around<00:02:08.099> being<00:02:08.459> reasonably<00:02:08.880> short<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.330> sharp

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
around being reasonably short and sharp

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
around being reasonably short and sharp
but<00:02:09.780> every<00:02:10.200> time<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.440> hear<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> word<00:02:10.709> help<00:02:11.099> in
