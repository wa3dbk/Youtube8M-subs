00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.220
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.260
 what cortina basically shows 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.060
 Everything can and most importantly that was 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.100
 the spectators ask how to talk about 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.500
 container also quite normal programs 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.270
 So I can start here now 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.600
 now and left and if only one 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.099
 clique i always have a micro and then 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.239
 is so to speak , so to speak 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.239
 how much is 57 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.040
 I can still read that here 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.870
 the result is twelve i get it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.010
 can be displayed directly theoretically now 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.010
 continue to calculate here 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 There is a lot of this kind 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 command the portans almost directly themselves 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.550
 can show 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.850
 For example, I can weather one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 ask 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.320
 how will the weather be tomorrow in cologne 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.280
 I can get the text here now 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.049
 see also read automatically 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 in case of cases that I do not like that 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.430
 can read 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.050
 OK 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.970
 in the event that portaner something not 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.190
 Recognizes if I just forwarded 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.960
 on my standard webbrowser and there 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.640
 is searched in the standard 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.310
 Search engine corresponding there 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.330
 I am looking for deposit now 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.470
 myself video 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.470
 semper video 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.880
 ok is not detected but that shows 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.290
 same in green as said the firefox 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.870
 is now here with me the standard 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.220
 webbrowser will be opened and there 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 becomes the corresponding search term 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.630
 entered and dani match found 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.640
 in case of the falls that comes 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.000
 I will not tell you all about it 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.650
 recognizes himself 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.210
 I want to directly via container 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.550
 is actually going to look for a program 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 also quite simply if in cortina recognizes 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.940
 basically all programs with us 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.330
 are installed on the computer and 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740
 available here via the start menu 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.920
 so far, so I can easily 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.920
 call the startup computer 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.459
 because every pocket calculator 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.880
 all programs installed 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.530
 are of course recognized then because 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.670
 which automatically in the start 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.670
 enter menu 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.870
 instead of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.870
 the firefox and steam 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.980
 okay in firefox had realized that with 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.980
 but not the steam 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.220
 strong team 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.750
 comes the steam near 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 Of course , it has to be called 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.900
 the corresponding name also in the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
 start menu is available 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.890
 I can not call command now 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.069
 or say something like that but I have to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.999
 say 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.999
 father prompt 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.599
 to start the prompt 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.599
 because it's all here 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.230
 that's how we have them 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.700
 at that time the prompt so the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.700
 names work 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.610
 Of course we can talk about this trick 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.920
 theoretically all sorts of things 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.390
 Defining actions in the worst case 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.610
 All you have to do is over one 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.959
 batch file will be called and the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.540
 batch file turn that will of course 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.250
 from normal link or with from 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.079
 called a link 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.299
 and of course this linkage must be in 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.400
 so if we are here now, stacks are stacked 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.040
 show only very briefly 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.519
 So I'll create a new one first 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.700
 Linking the command should shutdown - r 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.850
 - t5 therefore be a reboot in five 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.170
 seconds 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.330
 I want to call the whole thing with 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.190
 turn off 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.540
 even if of course at the moment now 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.940
 None of them are drivers 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 is triggered but just a reboot 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.370
 will show soon that I just the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.230
 can define the term freely 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.239
 and as the link is called am 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.069
 also called 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.720
 so the whole must go to the start menu 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:20.819
 to be added there are several 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.530
 possibilities 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.810
 instead of stapling or should that be 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.729
 actually appearing here is still 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.349
 pretty buggy the function because honest 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.720
 said during the preparations for the video 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.120
 it works here now works 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.550
 of course not good but nothing 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.710
 Let's just take plan. I'll open it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.169
 explorer and go by hand in the start 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:49.800
 menu program data then we have 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.800
 microsoft but then windows 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.150
 instead of 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.689
 menu programs 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.030
 That's how I read that 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.740
 fall 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.740
 is this in here now? 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.120
 actually can find over here 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.120
 shutdown shutdown is here 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.440
 so 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.080
 from 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.370
 start down 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.500
 and already the app will open and the 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.970
 computer is shut down is therefore 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.970
 just okay
