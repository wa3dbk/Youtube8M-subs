see<00:00:35.590> how<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.950> somebody<00:00:36.580> had<00:00:36.730> put<00:00:36.940> silicone

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
see how that somebody had put silicone

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.420 
see how that somebody had put silicone
on<00:00:37.630> there<00:00:37.810> that<00:00:37.960> didn't<00:00:38.650> even<00:00:38.710> adhere<00:00:39.250> to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
on there that didn't even adhere to

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.030 
on there that didn't even adhere to
anything<00:00:39.820> I'd<00:00:40.510> stay<00:00:40.930> away<00:00:40.960> from<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.530> go<00:00:41.860> with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
anything I'd stay away from that go with

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.250 
anything I'd stay away from that go with
the<00:00:42.190> purpose<00:00:42.550> mate<00:00:42.760> gasket<00:00:43.690> now<00:00:43.810> when<00:00:43.990> you<00:00:44.080> put

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
the purpose mate gasket now when you put

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.030 
the purpose mate gasket now when you put
these<00:00:44.410> axles<00:00:45.130> in<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:46.329> axle<00:00:47.020> here<00:00:47.410> it's<00:00:47.860> gonna

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
these axles in this axle here it's gonna

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.150 
these axles in this axle here it's gonna
spline<00:00:48.579> down<00:00:48.970> into<00:00:49.329> your<00:00:49.480> side<00:00:49.780> gear<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:50.980> when

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
spline down into your side gear so when

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.210 
spline down into your side gear so when
you<00:00:51.280> put<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:53.410> going<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.770> be<00:00:53.860> laying

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
you put it in it's going to be laying

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.040 
you put it in it's going to be laying
low<00:00:54.430> like<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.270> whole<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.510> side

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
low like this and the whole the side

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.690 
low like this and the whole the side
gears<00:00:56.440> right<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:56.920> middle<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.430> there's<00:00:57.550> a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
gears right in the middle so there's a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.580 
gears right in the middle so there's a
little<00:00:57.940> technique<00:00:58.360> that's<00:00:59.050> going<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.350> help

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
little technique that's going to help

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.729 
little technique that's going to help
you<00:00:59.800> from<00:01:00.180> damaging<00:01:01.180> your<00:01:01.360> fingers<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.710> you

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
you from damaging your fingers so you

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.510 
you from damaging your fingers so you
feel<00:01:03.160> it<00:01:03.310> come<00:01:03.520> in<00:01:04.560> and<00:01:05.560> what<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:05.920> want<00:01:06.159> to<00:01:06.310> do

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
feel it come in and what you want to do

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.260 
feel it come in and what you want to do
is<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.330> want<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.920> want<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.220> grab<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.700> axle

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
is you want to you want to grab the axle

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.380 
is you want to you want to grab the axle
and<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.720> want<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.110> leave<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.220> up<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> end

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
and you want to leave it up so the end

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.580 
and you want to leave it up so the end
goes<00:01:13.659> into<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.110> hole<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.110> side

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
goes into the hole in the in the side

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.340 
goes into the hole in the in the side
gear<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.280> see<00:01:19.180> how<00:01:19.299> our<00:01:19.330> fingers<00:01:19.930> aren't<00:01:20.170> in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
gear and see how our fingers aren't in

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.039 
gear and see how our fingers aren't in
behind<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.860> flange<00:01:21.190> here<00:01:21.610> right<00:01:22.510> there<00:01:22.780> when

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
behind the flange here right there when

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.260 
behind the flange here right there when
it<00:01:23.080> went<00:01:23.409> in<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:24.520> would<00:01:24.700> have<00:01:24.820> caught<00:01:25.030> my

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
it went in that would have caught my

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.240 
it went in that would have caught my
finger<00:01:25.750> between<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.140> stud<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.890> flange

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
finger between the stud and the flange

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.100 
finger between the stud and the flange
here<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.360> would<00:01:28.540> have<00:01:28.630> been<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.780> pinch

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
here and that would have been a pinch

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.530 
here and that would have been a pinch
point<00:01:29.200> that's<00:01:29.740> not<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.010> good<00:01:30.310> day<00:01:30.520> at<00:01:31.240> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
office so we want to avoid that again

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
they're on the outside of this and we're

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.600 
they're on the outside of this and we're
just<00:01:39.250> now<00:01:39.520> simply<00:01:40.150> allowing<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.770> line<00:01:42.369> up

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
just now simply allowing that to line up

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.090 
just now simply allowing that to line up

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.620 
and then we're going to adjust up the
brakes<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:09.470> we're<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.420> check<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
brakes and we're going to check the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.520 
brakes and we're going to check the
differential<00:02:13.350> level<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.460> that's<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.600> make

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
differential level and that's and make

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
differential level and that's and make

guy go out to the scales and then they

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.190 
guy go out to the scales and then they
say<00:02:40.980> well<00:02:41.250> there's<00:02:41.670> oil<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> back<00:02:42.720> side<00:02:43.170> of

your<00:02:43.410> wheel<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.990> wheel<00:02:46.200> seal<00:02:46.590> leaking<00:02:47.220> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
your wheel it's a wheel seal leaking and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.600 
your wheel it's a wheel seal leaking and
you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.050> it's<00:02:49.380> only<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.250> hadn't

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
you know it's only because you hadn't

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
you know it's only because you hadn't
cleaned<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.060> oil<00:02:51.270> off<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.810> back<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
cleaned the oil off the back it's a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.860 
cleaned the oil off the back it's a
perfectly<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.130> wheel<00:02:53.460> seal<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.210> so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
perfectly good wheel seal in there so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.990 
perfectly good wheel seal in there so
part<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.500> job<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.280> make<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> rim

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
part of that job is to make sure the rim

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.210 
and the tire and the backside of the
tire<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.730> all<00:03:00.270> free<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> oil<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
tire are all free of oil so that it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.820 
tire are all free of oil so that it
indicates<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:03.450> anybody<00:03:03.810> inspecting<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> that

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
indicates to anybody inspecting it that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.310 
indicates to anybody inspecting it that
it's<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.220> leaking<00:03:05.760> wheel<00:03:05.970> seal<00:03:06.360> because

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
it's not a leaking wheel seal because

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's not a leaking wheel seal because
they'll<00:03:07.620> definitely<00:03:08.280> pull<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.610> over<00:03:08.910> for

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
they'll definitely pull you over for

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:21.800 
they'll definitely pull you over for
that<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:20.760> may<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.330> put<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> wheel<00:03:21.780> back

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
that we may want to put the wheel back

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
that we may want to put the wheel back
down<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.650> final<00:03:22.890> torque<00:03:23.310> these<00:03:23.580> which<00:03:23.940> I'm

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
down to final torque these which I'm

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.610 
down to final torque these which I'm
going<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.330> do<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:25.020> up<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> air

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
going to do because it's up in the air

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500 
going to do because it's up in the air
so<00:03:26.310> we'll<00:03:26.430> come<00:03:26.610> back<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.360> don't

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
so we'll come back to this but don't

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.170 
so we'll come back to this but don't
forget<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:28.020> torque<00:03:28.290> those<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.830> if<00:03:29.190> you've<00:03:30.000> had
