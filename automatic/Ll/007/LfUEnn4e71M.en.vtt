00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.399
 so here we are again in the caged method 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.730
 the part of them now the form of 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.789
 We first saw a 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.430
 general presentation which explains that 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.400
 how is it going on the sidelines by 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.110
 report to a piano keyboard etc 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.020
 so here is the form based on the here 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.580
 so she's paying attention right away 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.550
 will not do the first rope 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.980
 we strike directly the second of which 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.020
 the la and we go down the agreement here we 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.400
 can do this same agreement with a small 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.050
 seems she is here with the index but we 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.230
 will make it clear to the ring finger everything to 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 the time to realize it if I find 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.290
 so then I can make a deal of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.699
 if you see this this demonstration a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.680
 little accelerated compared to the other 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.140
 since it's the same here 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.300
 therefore grants C major one was in the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.409
 major at the start it's a major C 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.540
 more now the D major major E 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.659
 that we can compare to his boyfriend 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.580
 put it on a classic half shape you 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.100
 see there to appear flight concept 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.369
 singh since they do not have the same 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.479
 intonation to come do not have the same 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:29.690
 voicing so starting from that which is 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.430
 major if we go down the third of a 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.130
 cran we get to the minor here's you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 see menu always we always play by 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.280
 report 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.470
 second corner we never hit 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.470
 the serious friend when at this type of agreement 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.880
 this is the six miners 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.070
 then we roll like this all the way 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.070
 tolerate it etc 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.640
 there all minor gold miners etc 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.340
 then an agreement of the minor here is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:18.430
 remove one must ask this magic 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 tension it's one to seven miners 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.489
 thus seven minors including seven minors 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.489
 ares is minor now 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:40.280
 there we are on a lace pts 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.280
 it is thought to be 6.7 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.680
 and that's so revisit the second 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.430
 part of those are so the part that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.880
 about me or explained myself less 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.880
 quickly 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.480
 here the power chords always the same 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:08.200
 only notes on the second the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 third string so rather reindeer so 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.459
 it was music at the end of 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.390
 this demo I see there and if a little bit 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.390
 rock'n'roll 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.770
 well it's safe power plant 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.990
 then we come our little bard and from there 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.959
 this is May 6th but so late at the 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.989
 demonstration on the part there that is 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.540
 so much resembled omitted who has not 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.290
 need to make crates so here 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.189
 only the translation of the form of 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.340
 tuning up the the acute part 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.510
 Sunday on the next videos we're going 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.879
 see things that are maybe a 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.849
 little more complicated and can be a whole 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.109
 little bit smarter more unusual to 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.750
 use in country rock 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.370
 dance is a style so I invite you to 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.130
 see the other videos that are at my 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.849
 more interesting opinion than this one to 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.789
 soon and especially do not hesitate to do 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:25.810
 a like I like and it is to register 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.810
 on this channel
