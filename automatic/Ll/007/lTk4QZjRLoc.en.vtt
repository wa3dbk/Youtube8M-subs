on holiday and we wanted them to
experience<00:00:40.790> New<00:00:41.030> Zealand<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:42.650> started

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
experience New Zealand so I started

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.450 
experience New Zealand so I started
researching<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:44.830> came<00:00:45.830> up<00:00:45.980> with<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.160> idea

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
researching and came up with the idea

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.640 
researching and came up with the idea
for<00:00:46.520> how<00:00:46.730> swapping<00:00:47.240> I<00:00:47.420> mean<00:00:47.690> how<00:00:48.200> swapping<00:00:48.560> has

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
for how swapping I mean how swapping has

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.190 
for how swapping I mean how swapping has
been<00:00:48.830> done<00:00:49.040> worldwide<00:00:49.820> for<00:00:50.150> many<00:00:50.690> many<00:00:50.900> years

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
been done worldwide for many many years

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.990 
been done worldwide for many many years
and<00:00:51.380> it's<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.620> formula<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.070> works<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:52.760> no<00:00:52.880> one

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
and it's a formula that works but no one

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.280
