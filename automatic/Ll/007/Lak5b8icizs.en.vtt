00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
thirsty and the only reason why is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.039

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
this is the main pulley zipper and as

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
this is the main pulley zipper and as
you<00:02:01.319> can<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.709> it<00:02:01.889> has<00:02:02.099> changed<00:02:02.130> significantly

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you can see it has changed significantly

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.109 
you can see it has changed significantly
in<00:02:03.299> color<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.109> is<00:02:04.619> dark<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.609> it's<00:02:05.729> actually

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
in color it is dark and it's actually

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.260 
in color it is dark and it's actually
darker<00:02:06.539> then<00:02:06.889> this<00:02:07.889> bit<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.490> but<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
darker then this bit here but it that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.080 
darker then this bit here but it that
has<00:02:09.450> also<00:02:09.599> been<00:02:09.899> exposed<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.849> see

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
has also been exposed but as you can see

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
has also been exposed but as you can see
because<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.420> haven't<00:02:12.599> put<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.140> padlock<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
because I haven't put the padlock on

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.699 
because I haven't put the padlock on
here<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.250> still<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.790> still<00:02:15.000> great<00:02:15.709> so

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
here it's still it's still great so

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.380 
here it's still it's still great so
that's<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.310> obviously<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.880> gets<00:02:18.120> used

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's that and obviously this gets used

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.760 
that's that and obviously this gets used
more<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:18.870> that's<00:02:18.959> how<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> open<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.620> bag

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
more because that's how you open the bag

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.899 
more because that's how you open the bag
so<00:02:20.209> that's<00:02:21.209> why<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.560> other<00:02:22.769> side<00:02:23.069> as<00:02:23.310> well<00:02:23.340> has

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
so that's why the other side as well has

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.730 
so that's why the other side as well has
got<00:02:24.200> darker<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.349> as<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
got darker and as you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.280 
got darker and as you
see<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> piping<00:02:26.580> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.900> has<00:02:28.050> got

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
see the piping as well that has got

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.310 
see the piping as well that has got
significantly<00:02:28.950> darker<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> hasn't<00:02:30.000> got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
significantly darker but it hasn't got

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.620 
significantly darker but it hasn't got
to<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.310> brown<00:02:32.790> stages<00:02:33.450> yet

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to that kind of really brown stages yet

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.440 
to that kind of really brown stages yet
I<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.980> data<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.910> currently

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
I like this data it's that currently

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.140 
I like this data it's that currently
I've<00:02:37.080> been<00:02:37.320> very<00:02:37.530> careful<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.460> bag<00:02:38.670> so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
there's no crisscross marks here but

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.440 
there's no crisscross marks here but
obviously<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:41.970> darker<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:44.330> there's<00:02:45.330> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
obviously it's got darker and there's a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
look like so little bit dirty at the top

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
look like so little bit dirty at the top
as<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.380> can

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
as you can see but that you know you can

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.020

wipe<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> away<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.220> baby<00:03:05.430> wipe<00:03:05.700> which<00:03:05.850> I've

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
wipe it away the baby wipe which I've

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.510 
wipe it away the baby wipe which I've
been<00:03:06.210> doing<00:03:06.540> but<00:03:07.010> unfortunately<00:03:08.010> with<00:03:08.250> this

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
been doing but unfortunately with this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.990 
been doing but unfortunately with this
because<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.450> untreated<00:03:10.640> cowhide<00:03:11.640> never

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
because it's untreated cowhide never

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180 
because it's untreated cowhide never
once<00:03:12.480> something<00:03:12.810> goes<00:03:12.960> on<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:13.500> kind<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
once something goes on it that's kind of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.290 
once something goes on it that's kind of
it<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.300> careful<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.150> see

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
it so you have to be careful you can see

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.650 
it so you have to be careful you can see
the<00:03:18.450> red<00:03:18.600> piping<00:03:19.110> there<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.910> also<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:23.660> no

it's never caught in anything or
anything<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.990> what<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.230> tend<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.680> do

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
anything like that and what I tend to do

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.150 
anything like that and what I tend to do
is<00:03:29.160> when<00:03:29.730> I'm<00:03:29.850> not<00:03:30.060> using<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.630> bag<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.620> to
