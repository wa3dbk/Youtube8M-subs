 which are not included in the full video to 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.710
 unfortunately in the third issue will break 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 tradition and since this arena release us 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 which simply and could not find 5 figure 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 who would like to show you but I found 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.029
 three figures who think worthy 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 your attention will be well 2 surely the case 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.500
 that was so 4 figures but only 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 she came out just disgusting with me I 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 I decided you do not even show just her 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 you wo n't see the world that really 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 it turned out it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.739
 I'll show you now so the first figure 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 this is our diorama for me here 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 scan sent by the subscriber but in fact 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.809
 I have long wanted to do everything myself 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.399
 this diorama has come off doing 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 for a long time just you mean a 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 there was no video so I didn't shoot it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 she is already starting to be unstuck 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.920
 Here such a diorama from us is simple 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 cube only here with rock and tree 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.260
 here here and so what is here on this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 cubes is it we dunge goes yes here it is 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.369
 dungeon here is drawn here from above 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.909
 Standardly wear this 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.340
 surface word pro racks type 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.070
 cities grass water 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 farther we go lava monster here every 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.930
 ore here too kind on the other hand 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.060
 rocks here too lava here again ore and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 from the bottom to the death of cedars it means and this is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570
 us down the same here here we have 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 a tree that did not come out for drilling 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.970
 very good but I was all waiting for the salon 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.900
 so I think forgivable although they 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.729
 very forgivable 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.710
 why diorama him so much 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.170
 big as it would be desirable and all because 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 that she has a very large sweep such 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.950
 somewhere here is such a scan and she 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.570
 It turns out almost the entire sheet is 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.310
 this one is a pretty cube 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.619
 did the little white measure in my 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 four and a half four and a half 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.460
 centimeter. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 quite a few they know five there 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 at five at least 10 by 10 up would like 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 more but in general it is a diorama 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.000
 pretty like and hope you 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.189
 too, and that our first figurine Well 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 eat go to 3 to 2 figures thought 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.610
 traffic 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.869
 hand you will like most likely you 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.560
 saw and 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.300
 it we have watermelon yes I got a slice of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.970
 two different parts because here they are 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.740
 so here I think many 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.690
 seen on the peak of papercraft and photography 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.730
 where are these but watermelon floor here 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.370
 so filed jean photograph someone 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.050
 did and behold the food looked at him 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.210
 looked looked and finally decided 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.830
 white local that is not here and so it 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.890
 Seeds Interior there are black spots 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.660
 on it should be here so well 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.940
 so in Senka millimeter grain 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.590
 did just one excuse me guys on 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.050
 I just did not have enough more 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.970
 cocaine small them there were pretty 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.190
 still a lot probably 20 if not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.870
 more that is here but to me as they 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 by themselves it is not very wound them 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.680
 initially did not want to do something later 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.530
 I thought yes at least a couple do and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 here did one thing so cool in principle 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.490
 but on the other hand you can not want here 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.680
 not even put and I'll insert here 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.660
 such a simple block of watermelon produces 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.550
 I like a thing could not what 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.530
 nothing special our so she is cool 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.840
 usually done as a simple chest 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.180
 cut about this under green 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.130
 the inside is glued inside the red 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.290
 surface from another country so the most 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.760
 all we get is 2 parts thought 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.410
 It was even possible here and so with tape and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.019
 about the glue to do and on the box here 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.150
 so that would be cool too so 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.739
 guys here are 2 of us today 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.540
 figurine 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.880
 I hope you like it so far years 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.800
 yours of course don't turn off the video so 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.709
 guys now we have with you 3 figurine a 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.769
 the third figure is our head 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.410
 ender dragon ask why only 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.000
 golov da everything because it's a head well 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.739
 how to say she yes she then 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.290
 ender dragon one in new version 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.290
 minecraft snapshot there some good 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.239
 pre-release u-19 already added a head 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.190
 which can be put on steve 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.630
 it's so real if you didn't know 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.250
 look on the Internet video about whether 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 ship yourself a snapshot there really 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.930
 there is a head and there were no on the incentive he 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.850
 pretty cool that's done on 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.459
 like an ordinary head that is nothing 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.830
 Especially if you have probably gone big 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.560
 agro copper -100 is that these here 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.720
 too, and its just a sweep of such a degree 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.430
 I am clumsy in that the creator seems 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.330
 a little confused, and instead of 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.970
 allowance here this one's short ask 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.709
 how to do below he did the side and who 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.720
 large silk allowance and then more then 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.580
 had to bend trim but basically 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.150
 the ears of the floor came out too January on this 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.560
 not bad 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.080
 not salat that they are pretty 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.330
 the small is also the usual nose of the ordinary 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.820
 such a troika there lilac such 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.570
 by the way over there i'm the type language and what am i 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.160
 I do not know here so here and something is in 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.440
 This head is vain Yes what I am here 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.280
 that's empty yes it is perfect on 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.130
 our steve 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.920
 it's steve well how would know and unusually there 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 Steve's sweep is the steve that we have 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.040
 Goes like throw off three types 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.960
 blocked do iskin it turns out that's 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.560
 such on size as and so steve then 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.210
 snails small little yes namely 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.130
 this head fits on him 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.140
 perfect and that's how it works 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.600
 so if you have a skin that you 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.250
 made pixies when crafting it 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.530
 her head falls on her just perfect 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.150
 typed and head on the whole sheet so that 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.490
 you knew that month you want to make 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.160
 we fit the slide head and if 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.100
 steam or your skin and so here we have 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.669
 it turns out only because it is not worth it 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.050
 what are you nose but with head exceeds all 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.720
 his advantage and 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.000
 well guys on this all here such 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.710
 today we had three figures 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.690
 these are figures that are not important in 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.000
 full video think releases will be 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.710
 any more new figures on video 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.840
 so it came out pretty gain and because 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.470
 that likes to talk on it all 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.570
 sweep and dioramas of watermelon and head without 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.640
 him in the description under the video 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.640
 but we know was Sasha and all for now
