00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.930
 hello friends of auto city today we are 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.370
 before the new series 4 coupÃ© a new 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.369
 denomination created by the manufacturer 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.550
 bmw to name your coupes more 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.770
 attractive replaces and improves in everything to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 the previous 3-coupe series with a design 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.790
 of much more volume and much more 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.710
 attractive with this print the sport 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.220
 It clearly reminds us of the 6 coupe series 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 at scale planted face loosely to 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:01:01.140
 the beautiful audi coupes and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:01:03.510
 mercedes the a5 and class c but what 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 truly exciting of this 435 and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 with all-wheel drive xdrive is the engine 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 that moves it a 6-cylinder in line 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.259
 three liters helped by double turbo that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.749
 delivers 306 horsepower what 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.440
 gives you benefits 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:18.900
 outstanding 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.890
 0 to 100 in 52 seconds and one speed 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.720
 maximum limit evidently to 250 km 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.180
 now the consumptions have also been 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
 reduced very significantly 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.530
 leaving the average at 100 kilometers in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 8.2 liters both in the technical sheet and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.360
 in real impressive consumption 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.970
 externally the series 4 is much more 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.030
 striking and attractive than its predecessor 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.760
 thanks to a much lower design 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.100
 sharp and aerodynamic beginning with a 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.170
 front more aggressive and ending in a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.390
 behind greater packaging both with 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.890
 LED lighting inside has been 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.380
 refined to the maximum fleeing the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.820
 simplicity seen previously 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 getting fantastic ergonomics 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.230
 that facilitates sports driving 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.510
 materials are of first quality and the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.430
 appearance is excellent putting it well 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.680
 gives the new automatic change managed 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.000
 by electronic lever as well as the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.000
 new idrive command 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.969
 Y 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.799
 for a premium coupe of 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.140
 last generation surprises us quite 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.269
 a rolling noise that goes into 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.340
 the cabin resulting somewhat annoying 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.439
 because of the great rigidity of the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.689
 chassis so necessary in driving 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.849
 sporty despite this little against 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.519
 the new series 4 is one of the 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.349
 most attractive coupes on the market 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.090
 getting to the level and even above 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.310
 of its most direct rivals with a 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.129
 very tight price and behavior 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.019
 sporty typically bmw if you want 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.760

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.200
