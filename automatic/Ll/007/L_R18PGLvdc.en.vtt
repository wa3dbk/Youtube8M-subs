00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.890
 hello youtube 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.700
 it's just a quick video of my cut in with the syringe 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.080
 One way you can speed things up when painting 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.509
 it is an empty unit so there is no furniture to worry about 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.929
 It's a trinity story and very uncomfortable 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.480
 Supporting the stair case is a bit tricky if you haven't done so yet 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.539
 you have to get up in the corner there 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 It's the right way to get a scaffold in the stairs 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 really the only practical way to do this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.880
 there is the spray unit downstairs 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.670
 I have a double length line 50 feet on it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.660
 I included the tape in tape with tape 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 so it will not damage walls 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.420
 It's the rifle that has a tip extension on it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 It also has a Grace cleanshot valve that stops the spit painting 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.170
 im using a fine finishing 211FF hint over the spray unit 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:46.079
 I use a medium filter 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.289
 im just spraying all these two sides 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.289
 Because im using a fine finishing spray tip there will be no windowing on the walls 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.310
 The only place I have to cut in the light, and the fan 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.280
 After a few hours I will spray the sides a second time 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 Then you roll the walls and ceiling in the sides 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.240
 in this house the ceiling at the top level is the same paint as the walls 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.430
 It is very important to use a fine finishing spray tip 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150
 It reduces overspray, which means you breathe less 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.740
 and it also has soft edges on the syringe 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.590
 rather than hitting the hard sides of a normal syringe 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.330
 under certain light conditions a normal spray tip 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.620
 will leave lines on the final work 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.270
 Once you're done using this method 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.270
 you will not be able to see where the roller meets the edge of the wall 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.770
 it will be a perfect finish 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.290
 you are always getting better sides where you can achieve the perfect finish to spray 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.970
 It's more for professional painters, home henchmen are best not to use the sprayer 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.620
 unit 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.540
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 I will be capturing captions all my videos and translating into different languages ​​so that 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 Please write to my channel and LIKEthis video :) 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.909
 One last thing I forget 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.740
 the clean shot of Graco 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.740
 If you have a hint extension it is important to 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.379
 when you release the trigger on the spray gun 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.689
 it puts paint in a dirty way without the valve 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:54.090
 The cleanshot valve knows when you release the trigger 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.599
 and stop the paint at the end of the tip.
