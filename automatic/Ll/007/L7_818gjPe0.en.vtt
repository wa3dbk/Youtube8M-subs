00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hi, I'm going to show you how to set up your 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 gmail mail on your iphone or android 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.290
 on your smartphone 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.230
 because sometimes when we enter our 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
 conventional password that we use 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 in the internet browser you get 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 like it was not the right one and that's 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 because normally in these cases 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.520
 you have activated a security system 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.399
 Two-step or a security system 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.020
 more more advanced within your email not 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 suddenly you have configured that 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.629
 provides a key by phone to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.120
 to be able to enter your mail or some other 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.449
 detail in terms of security that you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 you have put to your gmail mail but 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.980
 well here I'll show you how 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 enter a password that you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.850
 provide email so they can 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 configure any email account 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.540
 gmail that you have in your 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.490
 and also suddenly there is an application 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:17.970
 from iphone or android that is linked 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.530
 with your email account 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.880
 either by saying your contacts or your 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.300
 calendar or your drive account where 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 you keep all your files or youtube 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.970
 will always ask you for the password that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.040
 Gmail provides you for this 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.970
 security device that you 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.310
 explained previously good then 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.490
 here we have open we have to open 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.430
 our email account in a good pc 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.710
 you can also open it in your browser 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.380
 of the internet if you allow it 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 a stop version or a version of 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.150
 desk your cell phone or / smartphone 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.440
 enter from there, but I recommend you 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.580
 make it from a good pc then 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.320
 we go to this part 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.650
 to the top right we click 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.340
 down here this my email account 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.269
 and where I'm going is here to account 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.269
 I'm going to tell 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.410
 I go to the left where it says 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.410
 security 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.850
 do as you realize that I have my 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 verification in the activated steps is 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.590
 very likely that you have it for that reason 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.020
 you can access with your password 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.500
 conventional to your email account 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.420
 gmail then you have to go to this 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.120
 part not authorization of sites and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.120
 applications to edit 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:10.200
 verify how you are I have several 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:20.310
 several applications asking me my 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.310
 gmail passwords 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.909
 google reader for contact google gmail 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.459
 for several, he asks me for a 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.879
 password as I do the password 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.680
 then now I have not step one but 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.109
 have specific passwords of some 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 application simply puts a name 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.140
 to remember to remember then 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.470
 I decide 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.950
 key or password 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.210
 place by saying the name of the device 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.210
 with using it mail 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.100
 and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.319
 gmail 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:12.939
 on iphone 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.459
 on iphone or on android or on 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.669
 cell that you have then you 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.350
 samsung motorola I do not know something that you 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.560
 let's remember where you have placed 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.960
 that password 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.920
 account or gmail mail on iphone 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.930
 I put you practice engineer password 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:43.050
 and it generates me a password then to the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 time I'm going to enter the password 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.210
 I had cases when I ask time 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.190
 that is setting up my gmail account 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.520
 this is the password that I have to 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.740
 enter is not 16 digits as they are given 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.160
 account then you have to type everything 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.060
 that for once 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.300
 and another thing that is important 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.270
 that when you have your passwords of your 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.090
 Applications 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:15.669
 and you say you steal 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:18.289
 your cell phone or your smartphone here you go to 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.379
 be able to revoke 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.629
 to be able to revoke that password 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.610
 when the person wants to enter 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:29.599
 your email account will not be able to 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.910
 do it because that password is not already 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.420
 active 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.030
