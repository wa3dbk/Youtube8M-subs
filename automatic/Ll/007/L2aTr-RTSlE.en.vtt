00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.010
 a new chapter of móttola in the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 today's episode we will talk about the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.840
 necessary implementation that you must have 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.100
 to be able to walk with full security and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.100
 confidence of your motorcycle 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560
 the first accessory item is that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.210
 I want to talk to you is the helmet without place 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.559
 to doubt the most important investment that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
 have to do after buying the 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.030
 motorcycle the idea is always a helmet that 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.769
 have a pike that protects your face 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 sports here the eyes is also very 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.180
 important the ventilation that this one has 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 either for days with rain or days with 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 heat for the entry or exit of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 wind is also important that the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.339
 helmet come as a belt with rings 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 that you market will find 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.820
 also helmets with brooch which with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.190
 the time with the use they are winning 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 so this system is the most 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 recommended and the most durable the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 second implement article that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.140
 I want to talk is quite important 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 after the helmet that is the glove 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 always remember that after the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 helmet the most important glove because 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.759
 in case there was an accident the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 first reaction that you are going to have 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.899
 of supporting the hands therefore 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.789
 take care and buy some good 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.860
 gloves the third implement I wear it 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.899
 put is the jacket is also very 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.729
 important that they have protection 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.009
 in the elbows as protection in the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.960
 shoulders always remember that security 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.130
 it's a word that never has to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.840
 missing in their vocabulary at the time 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.490
 all other necessary equipment for 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.070
 be able to ride a motorcycle safely and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.740
 feel with confidence are the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.720
 pants here I have one that brings this 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.640
 knee brace that is included inside the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.380
 pants but if you do not want to have a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.619
 model like this one can also go to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.729
 any specialized store and buy 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.979
 articulated kneepads that can 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.869
 use under pants or if 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.210
 you can use them over them 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.920
 the idea is that you always protect the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.319
 joints especially the knees 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.360
 another article that is a lot 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.030
 importance in the protection of your feet 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.580
 therefore always comes to choosing a 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.229
 good pair of boots or a booty like this 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.869
 if you notice you have protection in both 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.580
 the heel as in the toe is also 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.319
 important that when you ride a motorcycle 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 are exposed to highs and lows 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.069
 temperatures so a shoe with 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.900
 good ventilation or with a good 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.209
 implementation by cold is also what 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.250
 adequate remember to always be comfortable and 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.870
 that the cold or the heat do not distract you 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.950
 when you are driving your motorcycle to 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.319
 finish with the implementations 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.470
 necessary to ride a motorcycle safely 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.480
 I present the leather suit 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.160
 a one-piece suit where 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 you will find included protection for 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.050
 shoulders elbows and knees is also of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.240
 leather materials and is articulated with 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.190
 ventilation in different places what 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.470
 which is quite comfortable to be able to walk 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.210
 on the street or if you like to run go to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.210
