00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.710
 good people here generate tagline in 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.079
 another new video on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.579
 a new location of a contract for 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.789
 petra according to what they would be from the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.349
 queen would be the silent fang that 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.530
 is what is the caves has been saved 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.260
 here from the cosmodrome 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.920
 This contract seems to me that I already 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.270
 I posted it a long time ago but 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.150
 silent fang apart from a 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.660
 celestial contract was also a mission 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.370
 of purple contracts and that's why the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.710
 mess of agreement and that 's why it's why 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.989
 I'm going to upload it again and as always 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.820
 I do the entire trip because it is 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.020
 the forgotten coast there are many people who 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.270
 it is clearly where the coast is 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.489
 forgotten but there are many people too 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.830
 new agree that doing so I 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.080
 I think it's going to do a lot of help 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.379
 agreement so that it does not get lost and in addition 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.120
 it does not cost me any work and nothing 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
 as I am saying we are going to go on 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.050
 what is the forgotten coast 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.470
 and on the golden coast we have two 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.170
 directions that it would be good to pull towards 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.970
 the left we would go to o'neill or 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.560
 ok we throw to the right according 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 and that what we're going to do, let's see 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.210
 to the right 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.790
 here in front we would have the strategist 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.240
 on this boat 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.939
 and we should continue on the right 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.430
 and I say this also this mission I think 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.390
 have a failure in because I remember 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.390
 have done it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.690
 If I remember correctly, what came out 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.400
 they were not gone 3 invisible where 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.250
 I go now that from here already in the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.770
 grottos as you are seeing and this 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.690
 the one below you have to catch and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.909
 in the background you will see that there are three 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.940
 invisible that in this case is one the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.890
 I'm going to kill because I was looking for him 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.810
 by the grottos and everything and only left 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.190
 one will jump me contract as you are 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.420
 seeing here according to the medium 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.459
 silent 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.849
 and what happens with this if not 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.650
 the three go out against and through the grotto 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.130
 well, but if we directly 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.920
 they eat the head leave or re-enter 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.480
 as dromo come back here to 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.680
 go to five minutes of doing it not 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.330
 you are going to love and kill him and three times we go 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.280
 to go see the caves is all this and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.660
 apart from all this also now I'm going to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.930
 get into my chair so you can see it from 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.390
 agreement 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 that 's where I 'm giving it quite 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.010
 door as I said I achieve 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.620
 remember that I killed the three of them and in 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 the same side of agreement but this time 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.359
 it only came out a man I've gotten 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.650
 in here, inside, take a look 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.060
 to see if they were here 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.099
 inside because all that in the part of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.690
 in also in the caves out there 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.570
 entered agreement 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130
 all this in the iraqiya caves appear 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.110
 and masters and we go ahead then 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.360
 we would go through the refinery that is where 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 are the surge of the first factor and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.460
 Cosmodrome but well let's go see 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.780
 that's why in the caves and I was 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.490
 reviewing and down here has not 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.710
 no one agreed and I had to 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.720
 leave me outside and re-enter os 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.850
 I say it in case it costs you the same thing that does not 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 you eat your head go out and go back to 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.080
 get in 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.480
 and nadal goes out here and there's not much more 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.640
 to say you already know the place for 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.800
 that they did not know is to the caves and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 you know clearly and nothing else I hope it helps 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.240
 I hope it works and as I always tell you 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.240
 Goodbyes and even another 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.270
 two
