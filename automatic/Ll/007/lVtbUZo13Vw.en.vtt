00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello and welcome and this to the apicius channel and on iutiub as you will be 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.519
 from pc on silk is the first Italian blog dedicated exclusively to 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.589
 third-party applications for mac and from the bottom 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.340
 the site was obviously inspired by paragraph and today on youtube we talk about the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 of an application developed by the intimate cor until 10 July 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.869
 and will be the protagonist of a countess. announced by price stands in collaboration 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.339
 with algoriddim that will allow you to bring 3 copies of DJs from home 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.260
 the excellent software that in practice with extreme simplicity allows to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.400
 become real dg 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 the software in question is what he saw. framed 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.960
 in the main window this 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.170
 with the black background found the dishes 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.990
 and they are all the tools to dj ment the right section 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.160
 it is completely designed for your library practically inside 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.080
 aitiuns 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.590
 you can call up the program by just creating playlists that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.880
 library. of Ã©tions or through the search function look for a special one 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.239
 tatters of adda. of the library 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.680
 for this test. I created a special playlist with some songs ca. now 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 let's play using dj is really very simple and su su 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.830
 obviously some small tests first to see the first courses have 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 already two dedicated songs we do we do nothing but put in play first 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.369
 dish 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.719
 sky very simple way for them. in which anyway 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.179
 the first song when play we can choose another song to put 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.179
 on the second plate 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 pedegre that free effects 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.280
 dj are really very beautiful even the audi effects 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.220
 he further emphasizes that dj is very simple for example to switch from one 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.300
 room to the other 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.010
 that's enough. also play the second song, then drag me into tsar 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 in this way of mind 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 the second song 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.830
 will be the one reproduced in the first at the moment the ass if it can point blue 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.570
 painted blue there is no sound whatsoever 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.260
 if we wanted to create transactions a little more appealing posters and 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.020
 use the transitional transaction - sorry please post to 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.300
 in the bottom part. the program here as you see found a series of 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.529
 presets 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.359
 that you can use to go from one song to another in a very kelly way 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.889
 anyway I could also hand much more text for example select the 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.889
 inverse feature 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.219
 and with a simple click of the mouse we did love you make one 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.580
 transition between two tracks 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.230
 as if we were real DJs 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.580
 this is one. of the goodies of the software and that I allow myself. become 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.660
 rt if i get right and is very simple to use. I really care about 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.049
 to underline it ancona 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.760
 other callable options 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.000
 to begin with, cloths from the top menu of the world in mind. we can see it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.020
 it shocks you to sell already more control of the tracks way 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.549
 much more serious than using the mouse 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.760
 then we want to look at the effects in the zero piece and we can 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.939
 apply to songs while they are on TV then playing in real time 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.669
 simply a. selecting effects like you reverber cook 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.980
 another very nice dd 5 potion makes it possible to become 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.440
 deal with the same first on the profession of the DJ and that of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.830
 simply log on you have a mac laptop with and intrastat put 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.830
 two fingers on the building transfer love above the plate 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.229
 in this way it provides the real scratches the vinyls as if you were gods 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.229
 real DJs 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:52.500
 very nice apogea that enriches the user experience. of the program 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.209
 and makes it even more fun and even more fun. to use 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.199
 another very very important function of who is that of yesterday to be able to 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:06.349
 to reproduce completely automatic music in fact through 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.239
 the automix function 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.409
 stop. discount anyway by clicking on the appropriate button 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.120
 automatically whore 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.190
 if it plays the various tracks you want to see in a sequence 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.620
 inside your library or in a playlist 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.499
 specially created in this way you have to worry 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.620
 b nothing because the software is completely automatic 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.460
 crera of trumpet blatter treats so you can safely leave 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.620
 do everything dj and he will take care of the sea your party 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.479
 dj also 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.150
 through this stinking hour it allows you to see the history of the songs you 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.770
 you have is reproduced on the software 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.889
