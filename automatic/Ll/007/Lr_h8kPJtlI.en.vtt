00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 yes you tube for the first approach with 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.689
 ghonim long considered with which 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.099
 wants to start animate in rios 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.349
 and I finally have now 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.349
 leads to a decidedly one 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:29.609
 adaptation of a light novel hiroaki 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.790
 karo which was produced by id 2008 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.550
 under the direction of takayuki hammam and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 then 2000 also considers the first time 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.559
 was broadcast by free tv 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 the anime includes twelve follow 23 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.460
 minutes a grandma and a movie on the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.289
 will go back later 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 the story takes place in the year of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.559
 present but with the difference 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 that there is a law called the so-called 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 median hetzendorf that citizen to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.420
 sounds like books and other media 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 censor 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.739
 was counteracted in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.469
 libraries allowed their property 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.850
 if you have to have her and good too 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.340
 to defend with gun power 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
 the main character is iq katar the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.740
 first woman who is now the leyen 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.050
 castros connects to stop this law 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.760
 to counteract and the media before 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.390
 the media dealer commission too 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.790
 to protect 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.940
 the anime starts with a very same 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 character related story, too 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.680
 over the next eight to ten 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 do not follow the great changes 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 political situation will be more or 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.650
 less on the verge of telling 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.080
 main components do not stop your work 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.220
 the one the worker eco and the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.110
 relationship or 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.330
 looking for her prince of you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.200
 stop as a high school student in a bookshop 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 the qualification as took place times 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.990
 had defended 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 the whole thing will be over again 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 repeatedly builds the told 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 whole individual characters in addition to the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 Main actors are always again 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 themed recorded what now 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 not necessarily negative anymore 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 Feature represents the characters 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.890
 generally very sympathetic 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 are 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.710
 of course that does the whole background 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 about that really big 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.129
 Potential also had a demolition 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.050
 for example, only in the last 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.180
 some follow the opponent so reasonably 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.189
 play religion 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.640
 but is so reasonably thematized 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:18.019
 and then only really in the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.159
 subsequent movie a bit 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.540
 Unfortunately , I always come to the language 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.250
 Well, not everyone's thing that is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.859
 always many things that ask someone 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.920
 what's wrong what's missing? 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.590
 yes, one is very much but general 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.329
 I believe the characters very well 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.700
 the whole twelve were distributed 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.709
 and always makes sure that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.349
 building up in a nutshell keeps you going 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.970
 Again, look and through the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.470
 good or relatively well represented 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.569
 Drawings is the whole lot too 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.620
 nice to look at 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.750
 music you can now not so much to 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.579
 Report because you hardly ever 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.280
 it is obvious that she is then, of course 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.200
 also been caused by the situation 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.090
 of course, but now not so 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.079
 you have to say somehow 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.500
 definitely listen 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.889
 the whole is rounded off with a uv a 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.139
 a small dvd special and one 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.150
 film the film also connects directly 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.200
 the series and leads quasi history 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.879
 then to an end 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.940
 I do not want to see how much here 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.829
 anticipate everything else or what 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.650
 less in the season was missing 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.879
 then film becomes an end 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.879
 brought or 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.709
 the viewer is shown what he is 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.689
 Expect to say what you do so much 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.250
 increase 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.189
 what makes me come to the points award 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.430
 Tory and actions have the anime at 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.409
 I earned three points because yes 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.579
 pretty wide mentioned the capital 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.919
 background story actually more 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.229
 the story was omitted for that 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.970
 characters is quite pronounced 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:50.060
 setting atmosphere older too 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.030
 not much to tell me about three points 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.000
 to the character helga 45 points whole 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.199
 Of course he has his strengths here 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.909
 drawings animation all of me four 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.620
 points because he is visually very 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.299
 appealing actually is still 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.740
 bring in some medications here and there 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.110
 and the music parents of only two points 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.680
 the here with me no great 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.570
 to find positive features yes 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.390
 in summary then to say that 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.190
 anime he is unfortunately not quite what 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.020
 You expect when you are in the beginning 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.440
 maybe the pictures and the context of 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.410
 looks yes but in the end he will probably 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.520
 but your claims would suffice me 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.230
 So I can tell you 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.300
 also recommend if so much to complain about 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.530
 Here and there the characters were simple 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.440
 to rip everything out of here 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.940
 Negative to notice was indeed the end 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.100
 I can say that for all 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.500
 those who ask the whole question what is there 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.310
 the circumference still naked see top right 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.330
 the whole time 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:55.900
 this year came on the anime manga 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:57.280
 So do not forget it 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.120
 subscribe comment 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.120
 I decide
