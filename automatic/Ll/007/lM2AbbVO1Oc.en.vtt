00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.629

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:02.830
 zdorovsky panel is our arrow 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:06.009
 Arbaletnaya on pens made from some 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.030
 plastic theme and at first thought it was 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.030
 real skin 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.489
 but made very cool 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.920
 there are very cool clamps that is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:37.459
 Straight straight came up to the question 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:45.410
 that we have a trip varys he just not 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 working here it turns out 3 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.459
 movable what 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:07.220
 or moving parts this blade is at 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:12.560
 jack and this business is a whole problem 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 instruction what consists of what 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 for food and code cool 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.810
 pistol 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.549
 scary is not the case of a thief than now 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.060
 the funniest moment was there shouldn't have been 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.180
 go girlfriend and I opened the door by 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.870
 intercom without knowing who it is and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:53.450
 and should have come water prepared 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:55.900
 so always ask if she 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.900
 the intercom is ringing and just open the door 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.599
