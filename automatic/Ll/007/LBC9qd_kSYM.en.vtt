to make the most basic station reach
farm<00:00:07.519> you<00:00:07.670> can<00:00:07.729> make<00:00:08.000> a<00:00:08.029> mind<00:00:08.390> here<00:00:08.690> at<00:00:09.230> least<00:00:09.620> i

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
farm you can make a mind here at least i

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.970 
farm you can make a mind here at least i
think<00:00:09.950> it's<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:10.610> most<00:00:10.790> basic<00:00:11.120> patiently

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
think it's the most basic patiently

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.320 
think it's the most basic patiently
first<00:00:12.980> you<00:00:13.130> want<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:13.400> make<00:00:13.580> two<00:00:13.850> bowls<00:00:14.120> like

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
first you want to make two bowls like

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.620 
first you want to make two bowls like
this<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:14.990> then<00:00:15.710> two<00:00:16.039> holes<00:00:16.309> like<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:16.630> this

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
this and then two holes like this this

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.920 
this and then two holes like this this
is<00:00:17.780> based<00:00:18.050> this<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.710> pattern<00:00:18.920> want<00:00:19.670> to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
is based this is the pattern want to

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.859 
is based this is the pattern want to
duplicate<00:00:21.190> so<00:00:22.190> that<00:00:22.970> means<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.420> won't<00:00:23.570> want

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
duplicate so that means you won't want

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.439 
duplicate so that means you won't want
to<00:00:23.960> make<00:00:24.199> here<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:24.890> here<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:28.029> you<00:00:29.029> just<00:00:29.240> do

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
to make here and here so you just do

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.259 
to make here and here so you just do
this<00:00:29.960> until<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:30.529> have<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.070> size<00:00:31.580> to<00:00:31.850> wonder

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
this until you have the size to wonder

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.829 
this until you have the size to wonder
if<00:00:32.479> i'm<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:32.929> happy<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:34.370> let's<00:00:35.300> say<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:35.539> is

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
if i'm so happy so let's say this is

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:44.369 
if i'm so happy so let's say this is
enough<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.609> fill<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.089> holes<00:00:38.530> with<00:00:39.530> water

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:54.299 

pixel<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:50.199> then<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.319> can<00:00:51.499> find<00:00:51.799> elite

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.759 

approach<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.120> plant<00:00:57.019> wheat<00:00:57.319> I<00:00:57.530> mean

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
approach it is that a plant wheat I mean

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.229 
approach it is that a plant wheat I mean
I'm<00:00:58.129> Sam<00:00:58.639> and<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.949> listen<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.100> region<00:01:01.549> will

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
I'm Sam and you listen the region will

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.780 
I'm Sam and you listen the region will
grow<00:01:02.600> faster<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.140> more<00:01:06.920> tea<00:01:07.190> simplified

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
grow faster so it is more tea simplified

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.290 
grow faster so it is more tea simplified
planet<00:01:08.480> p<00:01:08.990> streets<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.770> sand<00:01:10.460> instead<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.150> a

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
planet p streets and sand instead of a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.600 
planet p streets and sand instead of a
cross<00:01:11.570> on<00:01:11.840> family<00:01:12.350> planning<00:01:12.890> them<00:01:13.190> on<00:01:13.370> right

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
cross on family planning them on right

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.020 
cross on family planning them on right
now<00:01:16.330> but<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.560> visibly<00:01:19.400> what<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.850> will

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
now but this is visibly what you will

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.900 
now but this is visibly what you will
end<00:01:20.210> up<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:21.130> another<00:01:22.130> thing<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:22.730> do

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
end up with and another thing you can do

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.320 
end up with and another thing you can do
is<00:01:23.120> that<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:25.130> holes<00:01:25.820> where<00:01:26.120> i<00:01:26.150> have

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
is that you have the holes where i have

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.870 
is that you have the holes where i have
the<00:01:26.480> water<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.290> put<00:01:27.680> lily<00:01:28.400> pads<00:01:28.640> on

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
the water and you can put lily pads on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.770 
the water and you can put lily pads on
top<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.300> them<00:01:29.510> so<00:01:30.320> when<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.620> harvest<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.780> they

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
top of them so when you harvest the they

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.980 
top of them so when you harvest the they
reach<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.850> they<00:01:34.850> will<00:01:35.060> not<00:01:35.240> fall<00:01:35.540> into<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
reach you they will not fall into the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.490 
reach you they will not fall into the
