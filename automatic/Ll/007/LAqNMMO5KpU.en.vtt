let's take a look at the box you have

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.549 
let's take a look at the box you have
your<00:00:31.949> AP<00:00:32.279> logos<00:00:32.700> everywhere<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> same<00:00:37.230> box

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
your AP logos everywhere the same box

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
your AP logos everywhere the same box
over<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.100> over<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:39.450> haven't<00:00:39.780> changed<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
over and over they haven't changed it to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
over and over they haven't changed it to
my<00:00:40.620> knowledge<00:00:49.940> let's<00:00:50.940> first<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.570> at

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
my knowledge let's first take a look at

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.639 
my knowledge let's first take a look at
what<00:00:52.260> comes<00:00:54.079> underneath<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> watch<00:00:58.260> box<00:01:00.649> this

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
what comes underneath the watch box this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.960 
what comes underneath the watch box this
is<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> receipt<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> always<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is the receipt you always have the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.410 
is the receipt you always have the
warranty<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.110> warranty<00:01:10.140> book<00:01:11.210> also<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
warranty the warranty book also has a

warranty the warranty book also has a
certificate<00:01:12.900> inside

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.649 

so<00:01:20.689> on<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.079> first<00:01:21.259> page<00:01:22.180> gives<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.329> lot<00:01:23.539> of
