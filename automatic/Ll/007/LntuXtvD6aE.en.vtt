which<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.560> don't<00:00:59.620> think<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.070> fans<00:01:00.340> will

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
which I don't think the fans will

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.810 
which I don't think the fans will
anticipate<00:01:01.180> what<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.570> is<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:03.550> I

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
anticipate what that is and because I

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.009 
anticipate what that is and because I
did<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.030> that's<00:01:04.299> not<00:01:04.570> what<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:04.750> would<00:01:04.930> have

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
did I that's not what I would have

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.539 
did I that's not what I would have
pictured<00:01:05.259> with<00:01:05.590> them<00:01:05.740> once<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.070> read<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:06.460> was

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
pictured with them once I read it I was

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.030 
pictured with them once I read it I was
like<00:01:06.670> oh<00:01:06.790> yeah<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.770> completely<00:01:08.770> makes

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
like oh yeah that is completely makes

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.370 
like oh yeah that is completely makes
sense<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:09.640> take<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.750> consider<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.320> have

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
sense and you take in consider you have

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380 
sense and you take in consider you have
to<00:01:11.530> take<00:01:11.650> in<00:01:11.770> consideration<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:12.460> full<00:01:12.760> spectrum

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
to take in consideration a full spectrum

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.670 
to take in consideration a full spectrum
with<00:01:13.690> Caroline<00:01:14.110> even<00:01:14.140> Caroline<00:01:14.800> for<00:01:15.130> season

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
with Caroline even Caroline for season

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
with Caroline even Caroline for season
so<00:01:17.520> she's<00:01:17.940> definitely<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.630> different

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so she's definitely in a very different

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.950 
so she's definitely in a very different
place<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.440> do<00:01:19.560> jump<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.010> future

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
place when we do jump to the future

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.440 
place when we do jump to the future

so beautiful about last season was that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.380 
so beautiful about last season was that
even<00:02:09.380> through<00:02:09.560> all<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.920> mythology<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.970> in

the<00:02:11.630> supernatural<00:02:12.470> chaos<00:02:13.160> there<00:02:13.640> was<00:02:13.820> just

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the supernatural chaos there was just

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.490 
the supernatural chaos there was just
such<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> simplicity<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.140> fact<00:02:15.350> that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
such a simplicity and the fact that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.080 
such a simplicity and the fact that
there<00:02:15.740> was<00:02:15.860> nothing<00:02:16.070> anyone<00:02:16.550> could<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:16.880> about

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
there was nothing anyone could do about

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.660 
there was nothing anyone could do about
the<00:02:17.540> fact<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.320> her<00:02:18.530> mother<00:02:18.560> was<00:02:18.950> dying<00:02:19.220> and

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
be Caroline would go with the good guys

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.659 
be Caroline would go with the good guys
because<00:04:29.620> that's<00:04:29.919> what<00:04:30.130> she's<00:04:30.280> kind<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.520> done

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
because that's what she's kind of done

because that's what she's kind of done
up<00:04:30.819> to<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.150> point<00:04:31.330> but<00:04:31.720> who<00:04:31.930> knows<00:04:32.139> maybe<00:04:32.819> who

knows<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.389> have<00:04:34.509> no<00:04:34.599> idea<00:04:35.460> who's<00:04:36.460> here<00:04:36.669> and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.680 

um<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:46.160> hope<00:04:46.670> I<00:04:46.910> think<00:04:46.940> everyone<00:04:47.480> knows<00:04:47.660> that

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
um I hope I think everyone knows that

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.670 
um I hope I think everyone knows that
Elena's<00:04:48.260> not<00:04:48.460> dead<00:04:49.460> so<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.380> for

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
Elena's not dead so I think so for

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.770 
Elena's not dead so I think so for
Caroline<00:04:52.370> Caroline<00:04:52.820> knows<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.390> she'll<00:04:53.600> see

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
Caroline Caroline knows that she'll see

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.620 
Caroline Caroline knows that she'll see
Elena<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:55.160> future<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:55.910> think<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.390> grief

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
Elena in the future so I think the grief

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.170 
Elena in the future so I think the grief
verb<00:04:56.960> Bonnie<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.620> more<00:04:57.830> out<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.060> guilts<00:04:59.060> as

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
verb Bonnie is more out of guilts as

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.210 
verb Bonnie is more out of guilts as
well<00:04:59.390> because<00:04:59.870> every<00:05:00.140> day<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.620> she<00:05:00.770> lives<00:05:01.040> is

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
well because every day that she lives is

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.580 
well because every day that she lives is
another<00:05:01.490> day<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:02.000> her<00:05:02.450> friends<00:05:02.960> can't<00:05:03.410> be

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
another day that her friends can't be

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.650 
another day that her friends can't be
with<00:05:03.770> Elena<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:07.030> think<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.330> they<00:05:08.420> just

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
with Elena so I think that they just

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.000 
with Elena so I think that they just
start<00:05:08.810> experiencing<00:05:09.410> two<00:05:09.620> different

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
start experiencing two different

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.130 
start experiencing two different
versions<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.520> grief<00:05:10.730> I<00:05:11.090> think<00:05:11.660> we'll<00:05:11.870> have

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
versions of grief I think we'll have

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.720 
versions of grief I think we'll have
wonderful<00:05:12.770> scenes<00:05:12.980> with<00:05:13.160> Caroline<00:05:13.580> and

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
wonderful scenes with Caroline and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.180 
wonderful scenes with Caroline and
Bonnie<00:05:13.850> at<00:05:14.240> this<00:05:14.720> point<00:05:15.020> we're<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:15.800> early<00:05:15.830> on

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
Bonnie at this point we're so early on

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.430 
Bonnie at this point we're so early on
in<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.490> season<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:17.120> we<00:05:17.690> do<00:05:17.870> have<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.140> lot<00:05:18.410> of
