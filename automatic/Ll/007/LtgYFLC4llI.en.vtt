00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.420 

okay<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.960> think<00:03:30.110> they've<00:03:30.440> taken<00:03:30.800> close<00:03:31.250> to

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
okay so I think they've taken close to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.780 
okay so I think they've taken close to
about<00:03:31.640> 30<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.360> 40<00:03:32.660> seconds<00:03:33.020> together<00:03:33.790> becomes

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
about 30 to 40 seconds together becomes

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.730 
about 30 to 40 seconds together becomes
this<00:03:34.970> color<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:35.960> we're<00:03:36.110> looking<00:03:36.380> at<00:03:36.530> something

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
this color so we're looking at something

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.720 
this color so we're looking at something
it's<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.040> golden<00:03:37.370> brown<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.880> remember<00:03:38.390> that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's a golden brown and remember that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.490 
it's a golden brown and remember that
they<00:03:40.730> still<00:03:41.150> continue<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.660> cook<00:03:41.960> even<00:03:42.260> after

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
they still continue to cook even after

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.380 
they still continue to cook even after
you<00:03:42.560> remove<00:03:42.860> them<00:03:42.980> from<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.310> oil<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.910> they

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
you remove them from the oil so they

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.570 
you remove them from the oil so they
will<00:03:44.570> continue<00:03:44.720> cook<00:03:45.200> maybe<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.920> 10<00:03:46.250> minutes

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
will continue cook maybe of 10 minutes

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.820 
will continue cook maybe of 10 minutes
they<00:03:46.940> will<00:03:47.000> become<00:03:47.300> nice<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.900> crunchy<00:03:48.530> from

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
they will become nice and crunchy from

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.590 
they will become nice and crunchy from
the<00:03:49.010> outside<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.520> remain<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:50.150> softness

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600
