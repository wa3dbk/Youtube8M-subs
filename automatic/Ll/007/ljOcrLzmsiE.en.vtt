00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.220
 yes there are some dogs that listen and 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.050
 the leash the higher the collar 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.450
 jump up and know that is now 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.550
 the state and actually no two 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.650
 minutes later the dog is outside 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.360
 most dogs will hear somehow 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.590
 even to the entrance is good we go 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.630
 here right away and do not be like that 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.739
 crazy and break is good is good 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.239
 Now it's time to settle down 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.190
 first and similar with the and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.660
 actually tells it worse 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.390
 because the dog says she is excited 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.840
 and you too now because we're leaving 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.870
 I recommend the leash 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 the collar the key the dogs 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.309
 jacket and maybe even the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.769
 Hundeschule several times a day 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.359
 use if it is the collar then 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.589
 I get up in the morning to pick up the collar 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.760
 bring round with my dogs 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.050
 straight home for a cup 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.699
 coffee that one again 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.409
 Runs through the apartment is times 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.429
 in a different place and I do that 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.409
 several times a day 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.330
 I pull my dogs several times a day 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.070
 yes came to a dog school but me 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.650
 pull them out again, thus ensuring 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 My dog ​​does not always go out 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.860
 although I hear it so you can get the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.990
 drive down a bit again 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 who can not do it when I have the time 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.260
 because something can feel like chewing gum 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.240
 there has been a getting used to 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.160
 who did not manage that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 possibility to work against 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.500
 Do not give the seat a seat 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.120
 stay at the end of the corridor and at the other 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 the end is quietly pulling on my jacket 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.860
 namely in peace my car key 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.230
 professionally in peace my little and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.920
 very important if we have the apartment 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.470
 leave 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.720
 the dog owner always goes first 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.430
 because I now bring my dog with me 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.290
 new territory when I am there 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.290
 I want to be more specific 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.310
 there should be quite precede 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.020
 Most dog owners have the puppy 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.850
 the loads run in front of it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.070
 He wants to explore his world 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 you afterwards just as a big mistake 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.909
 if you use a flexible one now 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.039
 she rolls off the rolls on was in both 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.509
 cases is the penalty if my dog 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.580
 The leash I can pull on the easy 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.110
 leash so that for the and one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 it will be a bit uncomfortable 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.610
 turned around slower and determines 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.800
 if he does not pull on a leash 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.540
 this train ahead so just the dog 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.069
 so a bit annoying that he feels 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 after punishment alone there is somehow 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.790
 something unpleasant 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.220
 If we look at the dogs world 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.470
 then you will see that if one and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.570
 he somehow exploits one 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.160
 other dog does not let ran and 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.720
 That is exactly how you should work, that is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.250
 I miss my dog when we are in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.230
 Forest are on the way and on something 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.730
 Edible meeting then it belongs to me 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.590
 and you do not go there 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.660
 you take a small tupper tin with you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.940
 fritter cheese a little piece of sausage a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 piece of bread with the dog then runs 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.840
 is carving away but remembers where 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.030
 it lies and if one sees now the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.800
 dog controls it here too you can 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.370
 work on the leash or with the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.820
 research that the dog knows he should 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.820
 not on 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.500
 First, think about it maybe 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.550
 itself such a boring is yes 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.810
 maybe you are yourself 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.090
 phlegmatic and a bit 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.210
 difficult on the road you should his 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.950
 Dog pretend that you are here 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.240
 has different speeds though 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.800
 you go through the forest sometimes faster 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.540
 sometimes slower you can go behind 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.700
 hiding a tree so that the dog 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.800
 he has to stay tuned because he is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.670
 Otherwise, you can lose some of them 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.330
 and then a little bit more 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.370
 excite 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.830
 but if you feel that way after a short while 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.540
 that my dog ​​is a phlegmatic 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.490
 adjust to it and then live like that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.830
 so that you from the binger he has no 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.660
 Likely it could be you that moment 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.940
 missed it would have it on poke 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.010
 where he wants to have it 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.560
 to join you to accompany you because 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.020
 you really offer something to many people 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.640
 that's what I imagined 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.380
 then have such a living and their 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.480
 is very active through my forest 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.580
 note that have so boring 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.080
 they annoy themselves for a lifetime and 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.700
 could have changed it so well 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.040
 you can do something there you have to stop 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.900
 know and that from dog to dog 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.360
 different one should not and through 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.320
 beat the forest so he runs there 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.510
 you should see that you have the 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.870
 enthusiastic about any lead things 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.870
 provides
