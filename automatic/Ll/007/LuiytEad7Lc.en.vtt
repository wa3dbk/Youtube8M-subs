00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.550 

today<00:00:04.720> we're<00:00:04.870> going<00:00:04.990> to<00:00:05.049> talk<00:00:05.200> a<00:00:05.230> little<00:00:05.410> bit

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
today we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.010 
today we're going to talk a little bit
about<00:00:05.939> PVA<00:00:06.939> type<00:00:08.400> it's<00:00:09.400> not<00:00:09.940> as<00:00:10.060> commonly<00:00:10.570> used

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
about PVA type it's not as commonly used

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.410 
about PVA type it's not as commonly used
I<00:00:11.350> guess<00:00:11.620> as<00:00:12.430> PVA<00:00:12.970> bags<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.650> PVA<00:00:15.190> mesh<00:00:15.280> but<00:00:16.240> it

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
I guess as PVA bags and PVA mesh but it

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.519 
I guess as PVA bags and PVA mesh but it
definitely<00:00:16.630> has<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.080> place<00:00:17.350> in<00:00:17.830> carp<00:00:18.699> fishing

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
definitely has a place in carp fishing

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.790 
definitely has a place in carp fishing
so<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:21.249> first<00:00:21.550> use<00:00:22.269> for<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.869> PVA<00:00:23.230> tape<00:00:23.560> is

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
so the first use for the PVA tape is

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.029 
so the first use for the PVA tape is
just<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.640> simple<00:00:25.119> humble<00:00:25.509> stringer<00:00:26.230> the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
just a simple humble stringer the

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.380 
just a simple humble stringer the
advantage<00:00:27.669> of<00:00:27.909> using<00:00:28.650> PVA<00:00:29.650> tape<00:00:30.039> over<00:00:30.669> PVA

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
advantage of using PVA tape over PVA

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.790 
advantage of using PVA tape over PVA
string<00:00:31.839> will<00:00:32.290> become<00:00:32.410> apparent<00:00:32.860> in<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.789> minute

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
string will become apparent in a minute

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.319 
string will become apparent in a minute
the<00:00:35.800> problem<00:00:36.100> with<00:00:36.190> PVA<00:00:36.520> string<00:00:36.910> is<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.149> once

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
the problem with PVA string is is once

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.599 
the problem with PVA string is is once
you've<00:00:37.539> put<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.809> boilie<00:00:38.140> on<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.309> boilie

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
you've put the boilie on the boilie

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.580 
you've put the boilie on the boilie
becomes<00:00:39.910> quite<00:00:40.210> loose<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.660> PVA<00:00:40.989> tape<00:00:41.320> as<00:00:41.559> you

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
becomes quite loose with PVA tape as you

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.869 
becomes quite loose with PVA tape as you
can<00:00:41.829> see<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:43.030> boil<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.390> held<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:43.870> place<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
can see the boil is held in place and

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.439 
can see the boil is held in place and
that<00:00:46.149> allows<00:00:46.570> for<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.019> create<00:00:48.449> spacing

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
that allows for you to create spacing

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.590 
that allows for you to create spacing
between<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:50.170> baits<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.370> winter<00:00:51.579> PVA<00:00:52.300> tape

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
between the baits and in winter PVA tape

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.439 
between the baits and in winter PVA tape
again<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:54.399> useful<00:00:54.820> because<00:00:54.910> as<00:00:55.149> a<00:00:55.239> water

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
again is very useful because as a water

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.160 
again is very useful because as a water
level<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:56.530> water<00:00:56.620> temperatures<00:00:57.160> drop<00:00:58.170> some

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
level the water temperatures drop some

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.729 
level the water temperatures drop some
PVA<00:00:59.559> doesn't<00:01:00.039> melt<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:01.269> when<00:01:01.510> you've<00:01:01.660> got<00:01:01.870> all

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
PVA doesn't melt and when you've got all

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.420 
PVA doesn't melt and when you've got all
the<00:01:03.010> boilies<00:01:03.339> bunched<00:01:03.730> up<00:01:03.879> on<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> stringer

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the boilies bunched up on a stringer

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.830 
the boilies bunched up on a stringer
it's<00:01:06.430> very<00:01:06.670> hard<00:01:06.909> for<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.210> water<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.689> get

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's very hard for the water to get

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.780 
it's very hard for the water to get
through<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.409> actually<00:01:08.950> dissolve<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.700> break

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
through and actually dissolve and break

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
through and actually dissolve and break
the<00:01:09.970> PVA<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:11.189> we're<00:01:12.189> just<00:01:12.369> going<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.579> take<00:01:12.729> some

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the PVA so we're just going to take some

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.630 
the PVA so we're just going to take some
baits

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.870 

and<00:01:20.180> put<00:01:20.390> them<00:01:20.540> on<00:01:20.690> one<00:01:21.350> at<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.590> time<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.670> create

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and put them on one at a time to create

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.470 
and put them on one at a time to create
a<00:01:23.270> stringer<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.140> I'll<00:01:24.530> demonstrate<00:01:25.450> what<00:01:26.450> I

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
a stringer and I'll demonstrate what I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.690 
a stringer and I'll demonstrate what I
mean<00:01:26.810> by<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.350> advantage<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.950> using<00:01:28.010> tape<00:01:28.460> over

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
mean by the advantage of using tape over

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.930 
mean by the advantage of using tape over
string<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.800> can<00:01:31.010> get<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.280> separation

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
string is that I can get the separation

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.390 
string is that I can get the separation
so<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.210> when<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.420> bait<00:01:32.860> goes<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
so that when the bait goes on to the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.540 
so that when the bait goes on to the
onto<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:34.970> deck<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.240> dissolves<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.860> will<00:01:37.010> be

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
onto the deck and dissolves it will be

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.290 
onto the deck and dissolves it will be
nicely<00:01:37.790> spread<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.960> if<00:01:39.050> you're<00:01:39.200> fishing<00:01:39.710> a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
nicely spread so if you're fishing a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.420 
nicely spread so if you're fishing a
nice<00:01:41.300> spread<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.810> boilie<00:01:42.260> effect<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.190> last

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
nice spread of boilie effect the last

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.219 
nice spread of boilie effect the last
thing<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.850> really<00:01:44.060> want<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.080> your

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
thing you really want is to have your

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.320 
thing you really want is to have your
hook<00:01:45.470> bait<00:01:45.740> with<00:01:46.520> three<00:01:46.760> or<00:01:46.880> four<00:01:47.090> bites

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
hook bait with three or four bites

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.860 
hook bait with three or four bites
jammed<00:01:48.050> right<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.500> next<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.160> which<00:01:49.870> happens

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
jammed right up next to it which happens

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.140 
jammed right up next to it which happens
with<00:01:50.990> PVI<00:01:51.380> string<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.830> also<00:01:52.130> want<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.400> mimic<00:01:52.759> a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
with PVI string you also want to mimic a

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.350 
with PVI string you also want to mimic a
spread<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.810> boilies<00:01:54.820> next<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.880> your<00:01:56.000> hook<00:01:56.150> bait

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
spread of boilies next to your hook bait

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.100 
spread of boilies next to your hook bait
and<00:01:56.619> by<00:01:57.619> using<00:01:57.860> tape<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.630> can<00:01:59.780> mimic<00:01:59.960> that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
and by using tape you can mimic that

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.219 
and by using tape you can mimic that
I've<00:02:00.800> put<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.130> last<00:02:01.340> one<00:02:01.610> flow<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.450> IVF<00:02:03.050> that

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
I've put the last one flow and IVF that

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.230 
I've put the last one flow and IVF that
as<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> double<00:02:03.800> loop<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.369> reason<00:02:04.729> for<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:04.940> is

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
as a double loop the reason for that is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.859 
as a double loop the reason for that is
we<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:06.170> come<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.680> rig<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:08.509> very<00:02:08.720> basic

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
we then come to the rig just very basic

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.910 
we then come to the rig just very basic
rig<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.390> spread<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.810> hook<00:02:12.080> through

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
rig and we just spread that hook through

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.160 
rig and we just spread that hook through
the<00:02:13.070> type

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.440 

and<00:02:19.680> there<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.040> secured<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.300> can

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and there we are secured and as you can

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
and there we are secured and as you can
see<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:23.430> hold<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> very<00:02:26.520> nice<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
see I just hold that up so very nice and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.710 
see I just hold that up so very nice and
easy<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:29.190> other<00:02:29.310> advantage<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.090> PVA<00:02:30.390> tape

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
easy the other advantage with PVA tape

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410 
easy the other advantage with PVA tape
is<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.170> want<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.410> make<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> circle<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.520> keep

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
is if we want to make a circle and keep

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.840 
is if we want to make a circle and keep
those<00:02:33.630> baits<00:02:33.959> closer<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.490> lift<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
those baits closer we can just lift it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.110 
those baits closer we can just lift it
and<00:02:36.090> hook<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> through<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.490> there<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.820> it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and hook it through so there you have it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.980 
and hook it through so there you have it
a<00:02:40.070> bit<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.280> PVA<00:02:41.700> string<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:42.959> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
a bit like PVA string but we have a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.310 
a bit like PVA string but we have a
subtle<00:02:43.170> difference<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.220> give<00:02:45.320> definite

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
subtle difference that can give definite

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.720 
subtle difference that can give definite
advantages<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.390> waters<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.959> fishing

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
advantages on the waters at your fishing

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.350 
advantages on the waters at your fishing
the<00:02:50.730> next<00:02:51.080> good<00:02:52.080> thing<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.410> PVA<00:02:52.980> tape<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
the next good thing about PVA tape is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.729 
the next good thing about PVA tape is
that<00:02:55.350> if<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.400> fishing<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:57.350> lake<00:02:58.350> that's<00:02:58.530> got

catfish in these day ticket waters and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.500 
catfish in these day ticket waters and
you're<00:04:15.790> using<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:17.049> big<00:04:17.229> halibut<00:04:17.680> pellets<00:04:18.510> we

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
you're using the big halibut pellets we

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.939 
you're using the big halibut pellets we
also<00:04:19.660> do<00:04:20.199> a<00:04:20.669> much<00:04:21.669> thicker<00:04:21.970> type<00:04:22.770> which<00:04:23.770> is

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
also do a much thicker type which is

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.490 
also do a much thicker type which is
ideally<00:04:24.550> suited<00:04:25.090> for<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.720> bigger<00:04:25.930> baits<00:04:26.229> such

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
ideally suited for the bigger baits such

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.900 
ideally suited for the bigger baits such
as<00:04:26.680> ice<00:04:26.830> big<00:04:27.070> halibut<00:04:27.430> pellets<00:04:27.699> that<00:04:27.760> i've

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
as ice big halibut pellets that i've

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.330 
as ice big halibut pellets that i've
just<00:04:28.000> mentioned<00:04:28.560> that's<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.770> regular<00:04:30.160> one

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
just mentioned that's the regular one

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.560 
just mentioned that's the regular one
that<00:04:31.240> i<00:04:31.270> use<00:04:31.570> most<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.080> time<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:33.220> that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
that i use most of the time and that

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.840 
that i use most of the time and that
illustrates<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:35.020> difference<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.530> thickness

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
illustrates the difference in thickness

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.939 
illustrates the difference in thickness
so<00:04:36.850> there<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.150> it

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
so there you have it

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.040 
so there you have it
PVA<00:04:38.949> type<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:41.250> decent<00:04:42.250> product<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.870> gives

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
PVA type a decent product and it gives

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.400 
PVA type a decent product and it gives
you<00:04:44.200> an<00:04:44.320> edge<00:04:44.470> thank<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.130> very<00:04:45.250> much
