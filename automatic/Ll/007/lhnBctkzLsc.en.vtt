only a little bit for in like that only
a<00:04:11.570> little<00:04:11.930> bit<00:04:12.080> goes<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.860> then<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.910> clock

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
a little bit goes in and then you clock

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.009 
a little bit goes in and then you clock
this<00:04:14.720> ring<00:04:14.960> all<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.320> way<00:04:15.500> away<00:04:15.710> all<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.400> way

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
this ring all the way away all the way

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.140 
this ring all the way away all the way
so<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.170> want<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.530> tape<00:04:18.769> this<00:04:19.010> end<00:04:19.280> here<00:04:19.670> with

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
so you want to tape this end here with

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:29.200 
so you want to tape this end here with
this<00:04:23.170> tape<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.380> really<00:04:24.740> tight<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.280> time<00:04:28.210> tape

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
this tape it really tight this time tape

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.790 
this tape it really tight this time tape
it<00:04:29.420> really<00:04:29.810> tight<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:34.580> might<00:04:35.440> it's<00:04:36.440> gonna<00:04:36.650> be

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
it really tight it might it's gonna be

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.300 
it really tight it might it's gonna be
hard<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.160> tape<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.730> because<00:04:38.000> there's<00:04:38.870> some

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
hard to tape it because there's some

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:53.980 
hard to tape it because there's some
thing<00:04:40.310> here<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.060> oversized<00:04:51.700> like<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.990> no

thing here it's oversized like that no

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.760 
thing here it's oversized like that no
one<00:04:54.170> just<00:04:54.380> taped<00:04:54.880> should<00:04:55.880> look<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.770> you

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
one just taped should look like this you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.970 
one just taped should look like this you
can<00:04:57.920> rock<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.340> back<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.550> forth<00:04:59.620> it<00:05:00.620> might<00:05:00.860> get

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
can rock it back and forth it might get

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.060 
can rock it back and forth it might get
stuck<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.400> couple<00:05:01.790> times<00:05:02.270> when<00:05:02.600> try<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.470> fix<00:05:03.800> it

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
stuck a couple times when try to fix it

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.750 
stuck a couple times when try to fix it
if<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.820> can<00:05:05.090> see<00:05:05.510> mine<00:05:05.690> stuck<00:05:06.050> right<00:05:06.260> now<00:05:06.760> like

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
if you can see mine stuck right now like

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.610 
if you can see mine stuck right now like
that<00:05:09.160> sure<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.220> going<00:05:10.460> perfect

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that sure you going perfect

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.100 
that sure you going perfect
okay<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.650> just<00:05:12.770> realized<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.390> tutorial

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
okay I just realized that the tutorial

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.840 
okay I just realized that the tutorial
for<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:15.530> paper<00:05:15.740> Desert<00:05:16.220> Eagle<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.580> way<00:05:16.790> too

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
for the paper Desert Eagle is way too

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.630 
for the paper Desert Eagle is way too
hard<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.450> make<00:05:17.630> because<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.800> don't<00:05:19.220> lost<00:05:19.430> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
hard to make because I don't lost the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.050 
hard to make because I don't lost the
plan<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.180> this<00:05:20.750> is<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.930> basic<00:05:21.470> idea<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.310> so

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
plan and this is a basic idea of it so

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.870 
plan and this is a basic idea of it so
this<00:05:23.210> is<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.419> cocking<00:05:23.990> thing<00:05:24.290> back<00:05:25.190> here<00:05:25.520> and

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
this is a cocking thing back here and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.240 
this is a cocking thing back here and
sometimes<00:05:26.540> I'll<00:05:26.690> get<00:05:26.840> Jam<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.800> use<00:05:27.919> of<00:05:28.070> these

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
sometimes I'll get Jam the use of these

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.510 
sometimes I'll get Jam the use of these
paper<00:05:29.120> clogging<00:05:29.780> each<00:05:29.900> other<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:31.130> over

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
paper clogging each other and I over

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.860 
paper clogging each other and I over
taped<00:05:33.160> film<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.940> have<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.180> figure<00:05:35.419> out<00:05:35.600> the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
taped film you have to figure out the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.590 
taped film you have to figure out the
rest<00:05:36.190> because<00:05:37.190> this<00:05:37.400> is<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.640> main<00:05:37.820> idea<00:05:37.850> well

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
rest because this is the main idea well

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.560 
rest because this is the main idea well
now<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.470> have<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:41.140> cut<00:05:42.140> this<00:05:42.350> here<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.940> got

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
now you have to cut this here I got

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.900 
now you have to cut this here I got
I<00:05:45.600> have<00:05:46.230> no<00:05:46.470> idea<00:05:46.860> why<00:05:47.070> is<00:05:47.130> there<00:05:47.310> tape<00:05:47.580> on<00:05:47.790> my

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
I have no idea why is there tape on my

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.520 
I have no idea why is there tape on my
scissors<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.850> now<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:51.090> just<00:05:51.600> put<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.200> bullet

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
scissors so now you just put the bullet

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.600 
scissors so now you just put the bullet
in<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.340> mag<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:54.740> then<00:05:55.740> put<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.190> Megan

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
in to the mag and then put the Megan

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.600 
in to the mag and then put the Megan
cock<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.600> back<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:58.170> bowl<00:05:58.380> of<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.650> pop-up<00:05:58.920> of<00:05:59.310> the

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
cock it back the bowl of a pop-up of the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.720 
cock it back the bowl of a pop-up of the
spring<00:06:00.350> and<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:01.680> have<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.920> cock<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.310> back<00:06:02.340> in

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
spring and you have to cock it back in
