like<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.829> and<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:31.779> we're<00:00:31.929> going<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.079> be

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
like that and what we're going to be

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.690 
like that and what we're going to be
able<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.410> do<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.710> we're<00:00:32.860> going<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.040> start<00:00:33.550> a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
able to do is we're going to start a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.430 
able to do is we're going to start a
certain<00:00:34.240> distance<00:00:34.750> from<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:35.050> end<00:00:35.230> of<00:00:35.350> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
certain distance from the end of the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.459 
certain distance from the end of the
board<00:00:35.739> with<00:00:36.520> that<00:00:36.699> Gothic<00:00:37.390> top<00:00:37.660> flute<00:00:38.170> and

board with that Gothic top flute and

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.170 
board with that Gothic top flute and
then<00:00:38.949> we'll<00:00:39.100> come<00:00:39.309> down<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.789> the<00:00:39.910> other<00:00:40.000> end

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
then we'll come down to the other end

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.680 
then we'll come down to the other end
and<00:00:40.510> stop<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.930> same<00:00:41.140> distance<00:00:41.559> down<00:00:41.859> now<00:00:42.690> if

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
and stop the same distance down now if

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.130 
and stop the same distance down now if
you've<00:00:43.809> ever<00:00:43.930> tried<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.320> make<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.829> fluted

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you've ever tried to make a fluted

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.209 
you've ever tried to make a fluted
column<00:00:47.140> with<00:00:47.289> a<00:00:47.320> router<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.920> know<00:00:48.039> it's

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
column with a router you know it's

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.799 
column with a router you know it's
really<00:00:48.489> really<00:00:48.609> hard<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.269> get<00:00:49.449> all<00:00:49.629> those

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
really really hard to get all those

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.229 
really really hard to get all those
flutes<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.410> stop<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.010> same<00:00:51.280> place<00:00:51.609> it's

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
flutes to stop in the same place it's

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.729 
flutes to stop in the same place it's
hard<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.600> keep<00:00:52.719> them<00:00:52.899> from<00:00:53.050> burning<00:00:53.350> at<00:00:53.710> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
hard to keep them from burning at the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.500 
hard to keep them from burning at the
end<00:00:54.039> and<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:54.460> was<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:54.940> hard<00:00:55.179> all<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.480> way

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
end and it was just hard all the way

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.080 
end and it was just hard all the way

past<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.980> bar<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.550> side<00:01:36.820> also<00:01:37.830> we've<00:01:38.830> run

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
past the bar on this side also we've run

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.100 
past the bar on this side also we've run
the<00:01:39.400> board<00:01:39.610> through<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.360> where<00:01:40.510> this<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the board through to where this the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
the board through to where this the
lead-in<00:01:41.610> matches<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.760> one<00:01:43.060> inch<00:01:43.240> mark<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
lead-in matches this one inch mark and I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.760 
lead-in matches this one inch mark and I
wanted<00:01:45.490> as<00:01:45.610> I'm<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.330> through<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.840> will<00:01:47.050> stop

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
wanted as I'm going through I will stop

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.130 
wanted as I'm going through I will stop
when<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.730> end<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.180> board<00:01:49.450> gets<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.960> this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
when the end of the board gets to this

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.720 
when the end of the board gets to this
one<00:01:50.440> inch<00:01:50.620> mark<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.340> we'll<00:01:51.520> have

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
one inch mark and so we'll have

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.220 
one inch mark and so we'll have
perfectly<00:01:52.270> centered<00:01:52.920> stopped<00:01:53.920> flutes<00:01:54.610> and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
perfectly centered stopped flutes and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.980 
perfectly centered stopped flutes and
what<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.260> have<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.800> do<00:01:56.980> is<00:01:57.550> once<00:01:58.540> I've<00:01:58.720> got<00:01:58.870> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
what I have to do is once I've got the
