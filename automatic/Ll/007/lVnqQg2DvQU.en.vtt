00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.550
 Good day Omsk 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.070
 today he wants to leave such 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.250
 how much did they steal the championship 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.129
 shield 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.549
 what to do next to start wants 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.359
 submit for my name are schools 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.359
 Well, as we do not know today to create 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.539
 This is my first review. 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.570
 I ask the strong there not to discuss me and 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.589
 all such experience 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.759
 top of the championship round 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.009
 amount to say 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.819
 and so caroline simulator 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.289
 something like Colin makrei 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.830
 the fourth 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 103 of those scream vote 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 cable channel is still smoother 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.940
 closer to which model 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 and especially NATO recall at 4 besides 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 non english version 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.040
 but I want to say how different is different from 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 game mode history scandalous life 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150
 mode 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.310
 joint rubles 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.770
 here it is sluggish that is 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.750
 learning is in principle quite good 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.650
 signal player single game 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.680
 satellite career itself 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 inside the hand rather 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.500
 Immediately I want to make a reservation that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 I advise on rubles 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.500
 because many like I read already Lozova 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.080
 after all, love the zone did not see there to ask 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 pieces rubles toy workshop cards 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 toys 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 very much a simulator if you connect ns 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 Slovaks settings 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010
 and on foot 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.670
 what else how to be 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.970
 and so-so 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 Here is directly Samara 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
 not bad 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 but still 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.870
 goes to normal on construction sites 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.070
 LED pledge redemption price to dangle 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.150
 it's not bad too 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
 what can I say on the management of physics 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.590
 there is only one minus mida 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.839
 turn 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.599
 two specific turn 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.759
 where did he come from 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.409
 anyway 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.129
 you can experiment with payment 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 brakes 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.249
 any conflicts 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:29.519
 developers 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.279
 first time doing this 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.429
 except simulators 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.429
 about being too 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.429
 I never tried it online 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.019
 they are also very 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 Semak faces 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 coating feel 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.779
 I'm sure I want to say more 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.039
 that is, we see the car icon 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.039
 it is not shown as 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.849
 affects itself 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 pay a fee 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.979
 in interesting square 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
 most interesting if expenses 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.189
 in the year happens whether at all 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.199
 that we are constantly updated 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.559
 coin turning 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.119
 so as you know, no 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.119
 basically 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.789
 good plan 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:05.329
 differently future 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.329
 there is a difference between 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.799
 there is a fiesta 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.799
 and all-wheel drive Subaru 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.120
 in principle, everything went 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.400
 in this game, that is, we see May from ten 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.749
 points 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.749
 if with a wheel a score of 8 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.620
 better guys and sport 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.159
 under the keyboard iran 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.300
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.789
 I hope that the judges will not distrovy 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.669
 and I want to say on the future of the village 2 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.069
 I must do 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.069
 most simulator 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.240
 Orchestra 2 now seems to be the way 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 t 42 before testing 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.939
 but all thanks with 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.740
 what is the hearing 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.850
 it saved the meetings
