00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
decay of that sea ice in recent years
we've<00:00:37.829> noticed<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:38.489> been<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
we've noticed that there's been a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.910 
we've noticed that there's been a
recovery<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> areal<00:00:40.110> extent<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.710> sea<00:00:40.890> ice

recovery in the areal extent of sea ice

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760 
recovery in the areal extent of sea ice
in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> northern<00:00:41.610> hemisphere<00:00:42.200> 2007<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
in the northern hemisphere 2007 was the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.330 
in the northern hemisphere 2007 was the
minimum<00:00:44.190> extent<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> record<00:00:45.059> ever<00:00:45.539> recorded

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
minimum extent on record ever recorded
2008<00:00:47.340> showed<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> recovery<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> 2009

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
2008 showed a recovery to that and 2009

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
2008 showed a recovery to that and 2009
showed<00:00:50.129> another<00:00:50.399> recovery<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.930> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
showed another recovery to that so we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
showed another recovery to that so we
were<00:00:52.140> expecting<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.160> area<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
were expecting to go into this area to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
were expecting to go into this area to
get<00:00:54.600> an<00:00:54.719> understanding<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.620> was

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
get an understanding of what was

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
get an understanding of what was
happening<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> ice<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.510> was

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
happening with the ice and what was

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
happening with the ice and what was
promoting<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> recovery<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> thinking

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
promoting the recovery of this thinking

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
promoting the recovery of this thinking
that<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.840> sea<00:01:01.020> ice<00:01:01.140> conditions<00:01:01.410> were

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that the sea ice conditions were

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
that the sea ice conditions were
starting<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> rebound<00:01:02.550> towards<00:01:03.480> where<00:01:03.690> they

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
starting to rebound towards where they

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.760 
starting to rebound towards where they
used<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.229> back<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> 70s<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.000> 80s

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
used to be back in the 70s and 80s

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.929 
used to be back in the 70s and 80s
unfortunately<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.250> into<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> study

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
unfortunately when we got into the study

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
unfortunately when we got into the study
area<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.450> quickly<00:01:09.659> realized<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
area we quickly realized that the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
area we quickly realized that the
satellites<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.369> we've<00:01:11.520> been<00:01:11.640> using<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
satellites that we've been using to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
satellites that we've been using to
study<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> sea<00:01:12.990> ice<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> tell<00:01:13.590> us<00:01:13.770> what

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
study the sea ice and to tell us what

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.359 
study the sea ice and to tell us what
this<00:01:14.369> type<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> ice<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> area<00:01:16.369> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this type of ice was in the area was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.330 
this type of ice was in the area was
incorrectly<00:01:18.210> classifying<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> ice<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:20.220> were

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
incorrectly classifying the ice we were

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
incorrectly classifying the ice we were
doing<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.759> transect<00:01:21.420> line<00:01:21.630> north<00:01:21.990> of

Tuktoyaktuk and we were traveling in our

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
Tuktoyaktuk and we were traveling in our
ship<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.250> 13<00:01:26.790> nautical<00:01:27.330> miles<00:01:27.540> per<00:01:27.990> hour

ship at about 13 nautical miles per hour

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.010 
ship at about 13 nautical miles per hour
that's<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.159> 25<00:01:29.729> kilometres<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:30.479> hour<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that's about 25 kilometres an hour and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
that's about 25 kilometres an hour and
this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.979> speed<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> almost<00:01:33.000> exactly

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
this is a speed that is almost exactly

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
this is a speed that is almost exactly
the<00:01:33.659> same<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> ship<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.740> open

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the same as the ship would have in open

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
the same as the ship would have in open
water<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.850> should<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.420> been

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
water and this should not have been

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
water and this should not have been
possible<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.890> satellites<00:01:38.369> were

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
possible because the satellites were

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.800 
possible because the satellites were
telling<00:01:38.790> us<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> were<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.299> very<00:01:39.509> thick

kind of ice that we encountered was
something<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.340> seen<00:01:44.700> before<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.270> was

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
something we have not seen before it was

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.910 
something we have not seen before it was
a<00:01:45.450> type<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.869> rotten<00:01:46.320> ice<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
a type of rotten ice that was a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
a type of rotten ice that was a
conglomerate<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.060> small<00:01:48.390> pieces<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
conglomerate of very small pieces of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.410 
conglomerate of very small pieces of
this<00:01:49.229> multi-year<00:01:50.070> sea<00:01:50.369> ice<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.759> survives<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this multi-year sea ice that survives a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
this multi-year sea ice that survives a
summer<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:51.990> grows<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> next<00:01:52.710> year<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
summer and then grows the next year and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
summer and then grows the next year and
it's<00:01:53.640> overlaid<00:01:54.060> by<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.750> thin<00:01:55.200> layer<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's overlaid by a very thin layer of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's overlaid by a very thin layer of
what<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.759> call<00:01:56.939> first-year<00:01:57.450> ice<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.810> stuff

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
what we call first-year ice the stuff

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620 
what we call first-year ice the stuff
that<00:01:58.229> grows<00:01:58.439> annually<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.460> year<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that grows annually that year so the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
that grows annually that year so the
results<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> study<00:02:01.320> were<00:02:01.649> quite

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
results of this study were quite

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.310 
results of this study were quite
shocking<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> scientific<00:02:03.270> world<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
shocking to the scientific world in the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
shocking to the scientific world in the
sense<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.490> thought<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
sense that what we thought was a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
sense that what we thought was a
recovery<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.899> sea<00:02:07.290> ice<00:02:07.409> areal<00:02:07.890> extent<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.750> not

recovery in sea ice areal extent is not

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.290 
recovery in sea ice areal extent is not
accounted<00:02:11.950> for<00:02:11.980> by<00:02:12.459> an<00:02:12.610> increase<00:02:13.090> in

thickness in fact what we're finding is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.830 
thickness in fact what we're finding is
that<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.670> multi-year<00:02:16.150> sea<00:02:16.360> ice<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.750> the
