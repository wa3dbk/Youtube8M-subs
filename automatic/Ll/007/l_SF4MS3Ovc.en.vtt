I would like to talk about a question
that<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> keep<00:00:28.050> getting<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.550> I

that number come from that is typically

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
hold does this mean that you should be

a<00:01:00.090> day<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.070> people<00:01:02.280> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
a day no I think that people are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840 
a day no I think that people are
thinking<00:01:03.439> that<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> max<00:01:05.580> amount

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
thinking that this is the max amount

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
thinking that this is the max amount
that<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.450> consume<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.470> remember<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that you can consume but remember this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
that you can consume but remember this
is<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.880> max<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.450> glycogen<00:01:10.110> stores<00:01:10.470> can

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
is the max that your glycogen stores can

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.570 
is the max that your glycogen stores can
hold<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> glycogen<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.860> storage

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
hold and what is glycogen it's a storage

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
hold and what is glycogen it's a storage
system<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.630> excess<00:01:16.170> carbohydrates<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.490> are

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
system for excess carbohydrates that are

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
system for excess carbohydrates that are
not<00:01:17.880> used<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.720> immediate<00:01:19.409> energy<00:01:19.560> needs<00:01:20.070> and

so if you are a sort of sedentary person
and<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.950> nine-to-five<00:01:26.580> job<00:01:27.090> and

and you go to a nine-to-five job and
you're<00:01:27.659> sitting<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.259> whatever<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> still

physical and mental function

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.280 
physical and mental function
hypothetically<00:01:45.730> if<00:01:45.940> all<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.540> our<00:01:46.780> calories

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
hypothetically if all of our calories

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.930 
hypothetically if all of our calories
were<00:01:47.440> coming<00:01:47.710> from<00:01:47.890> carbohydrates<00:01:48.730> which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
were coming from carbohydrates which

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.880 
were coming from carbohydrates which
would<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.690> pretty<00:01:49.840> impossible<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.770> thus

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
would be pretty impossible and thus

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.920 
would be pretty impossible and thus
weird<00:01:51.190> unless<00:01:51.820> we<00:01:51.970> were<00:01:52.060> eating<00:01:52.180> like<00:01:52.600> just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
weird unless we were eating like just

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
weird unless we were eating like just
completely<00:01:53.290> refined<00:01:53.830> sugar<00:01:54.100> all<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.280> time

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
completely refined sugar all the time

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.960 
completely refined sugar all the time
but<00:01:56.140> let's<00:01:56.320> say<00:01:56.440> hypothetically<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.790> we'll

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
but let's say hypothetically so we'll

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.290 
but let's say hypothetically so we'll
divide<00:01:58.120> two<00:01:58.540> thousand<00:01:59.020> by<00:01:59.410> four<00:02:00.000> calories<00:02:01.000> in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
divide two thousand by four calories in

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.020 
divide two thousand by four calories in
a<00:02:01.330> gram<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.600> carbs<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.230> and<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.220> 500

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
a gram of carbs and and this is 500

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.300 
a gram of carbs and and this is 500
grams<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.690> carbs<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.160> much

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
grams of carbs and so that's so much

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.450 
grams of carbs and so that's so much
you'd<00:02:06.640> be<00:02:06.820> using<00:02:07.410> before<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.920> start<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.340> even

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
you'd be using before you start to even

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610 
you'd be using before you start to even
store<00:02:09.820> glycogen<00:02:10.000> right

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
store glycogen right

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.320 
store glycogen right
and<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.250> doesn't<00:02:12.580> happen<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.180> not

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and this doesn't happen it's it's not

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.120 
and this doesn't happen it's it's not
really<00:02:13.570> like<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> bank<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.590> anything<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:15.070> that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
really like a bank or anything like that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.280 
really like a bank or anything like that
it's<00:02:15.550> not<00:02:15.610> like<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.330> know<00:02:16.450> as<00:02:16.600> soon<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.050> go

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's not like you know as soon as you go

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's not like you know as soon as you go
over<00:02:17.530> 500<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.280> start<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.640> store<00:02:18.850> glycogen

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
over 500 you start to store glycogen

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660 
over 500 you start to store glycogen
these<00:02:19.960> processes<00:02:20.740> happen<00:02:21.190> simultaneously

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
these processes happen simultaneously

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.390 
these processes happen simultaneously
and<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.400> makes<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.790> even<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:26.200> know

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and it just it makes it even you know

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.340 
and it just it makes it even you know
more<00:02:27.400> important<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.090> understand<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.870> you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
more important to understand that you

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.660 
more important to understand that you
don't<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.740> count<00:02:29.980> calories<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.550> you're

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
don't have to count calories if you're

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.520 
don't have to count calories if you're
eating<00:02:30.790> whole<00:02:31.090> plant<00:02:31.120> foods<00:02:31.600> because<00:02:32.350> these

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
eating whole plant foods because these

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.560 
eating whole plant foods because these
capacities<00:02:33.220> are<00:02:33.460> extremely<00:02:34.060> hard<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.390> reach

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
capacities are extremely hard to reach

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.650 
capacities are extremely hard to reach
when<00:02:35.440> you're<00:02:35.590> eating<00:02:35.710> whole<00:02:36.010> plant<00:02:36.040> foods

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
when you're eating whole plant foods

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.950 
when you're eating whole plant foods
that<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.810> nutrient<00:02:38.350> dense<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.780> not

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
that are nutrient dense and and not

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.280 
that are nutrient dense and and not
refined<00:02:41.680> processed<00:02:42.190> substances<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.200> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
refined processed substances and so you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.740 
refined processed substances and so you
don't<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.250> limit<00:02:45.820> yourself<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.420> under

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
don't have to limit yourself to under

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.800 
don't have to limit yourself to under
500<00:02:47.260> grams<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.590> day<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.920> carbs<00:02:48.490> because<00:02:48.970> this

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
500 grams a day of carbs because this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.530 
500 grams a day of carbs because this
you<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.740> go<00:02:50.920> way<00:02:51.160> way<00:02:51.190> over<00:02:51.520> before<00:02:52.060> your

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
you can go way way over before your

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.630 
you can go way way over before your
glycogen<00:02:52.959> stores<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:53.380> saturated<00:02:54.010> what

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
glycogen stores are saturated what

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.280 
glycogen stores are saturated what
happens<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.150> people<00:02:55.330> on<00:02:55.600> righto<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:56.140> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
happens with people on righto for is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.800 
happens with people on righto for is
that<00:02:56.470> they're<00:02:56.950> consistently<00:02:57.700> eating<00:02:58.239> more

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
that they're consistently eating more

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.260 
that they're consistently eating more
than<00:02:58.840> 500<00:02:59.590> daily<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.060> third

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
than 500 daily and so that's the third

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.930 
than 500 daily and so that's the third
plus<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.989> stored<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.709> glycogen<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.580> then<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
plus is stored as glycogen and then the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
plus is stored as glycogen and then the
glycogen<00:03:04.420> stores<00:03:04.810> become<00:03:05.290> saturated<00:03:05.950> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
glycogen stores become saturated and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.250 
glycogen stores become saturated and
then<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.850> surplus<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.750> starts<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.140> be

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
then this surplus that starts to be

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.480 
then this surplus that starts to be
turned<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.650> fact<00:03:08.920> 3<00:03:09.340> p.m.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
turned in fact 3 p.m.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.010 
turned in fact 3 p.m.
so<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.520> hope<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.209> cleared<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.720> some

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
so I hope that that cleared up some

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.350 
so I hope that that cleared up some
confusion<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.920> may<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.280> had<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.970> hope

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
confusion that you may have had I hope

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.479 
confusion that you may have had I hope
you<00:03:15.480> guys<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.050> wonderfully<00:03:16.620> abundant<00:03:17.190> day

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you guys have a wonderfully abundant day

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.010 
you guys have a wonderfully abundant day
and<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.940> will<00:03:18.120> see<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.420> next<00:03:18.540> video
