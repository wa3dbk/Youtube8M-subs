00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 me 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 8 I met again 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.450
 What is this reaction 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.350
 Who are you different because they are messengers from hell 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:33.210
 That Patche's car pack Choi Do not say not you were killed when the mother 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:39.330
 It's a shame I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I can't talk to you about trick 4 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.090
 Well this time I brought it to the wrong 4 full colors and Magic Bomb's attack power as I brought in the previous mistake 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.820
 How is 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:51.190
 It is worth noting that it will take 10 seconds to detonate if you want to blow off 1500 bursts. 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:55.540
 1500 damage made it so that it is not involved because the wider range of explosion Shineru 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 Well guys I think there is little to get involved in the magic bomb cause 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.430
 dangerous or to treat only of b bmx is Kuhaha if I try to attention 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 La Yoshi This time I'm taking up the patchouli and coming from behind 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.969
 I do not have a sense of openness 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.969
 Problem art is 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.520
 answer 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:21.060
 I guess it 's an explosion 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 Even if it hurts a large amount of corps -it may not be clean and wipe away 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.479
 The feeling was good to say quite well 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.180
 My mother is my mother Oh Oh Oh suddenly frame stupid Yarrow 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.450
 I surprised Tteka I was always found in the back of the passage 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:41.270
 Why are you fighting like this ? 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.400
 Is one gift you what Home I was allowed little consensus that leave after 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.610
 It is bad to have a teacup 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.910
 I 'm not saying I 'm jealous , I 'll curse it 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.910
 Marisa 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.050
 Crazy 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.659
 But you Wow over Nannan 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.220
 I'll not bad off 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.200
 ｰｰｰhe 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:08.420
 Good as planned 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 ｰｰｰ Ta Patchouli is had been done elaborate Nante Do I have only this is apologize later 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.600
 Ha ha ha 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.870
 That mouse's response is bad 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 It is a curse of patchouli here or not This is a ghost if it can not be adult Buddha 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 Naa I'm not so much love 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.090
 Be dangerous Do to there as seen in a single night of the way home 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:35.410
 If you say if you want to Once Patchouli came out garbled your Contact Oh this done 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.730
 I'll be back there so I can go to bed and wait I'm glad if I just do n't come back 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.000
 It's a tough joke 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.670
 It's really true because it's really true 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.690
 Mouse response is bad patchy 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.220
 It will be understood if you enter what is not a curse, but such a plain curse 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 I can not write 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.220
 Well, when I sit on the bench outside, I have enough curse that the part gets painted every time 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.730
 The curse that is plain or simple 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.640
 How can I do it? The response of the mouse is dangerous 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.069
 A little more god 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.270
 The noise that was being heard is really damn defeating and I want to read even books slowly 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.709
 It is a place 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.810
 Iyama Risa is this I certainly'm not be helped because they were play-by-play 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.180
 Uo o o o go to the left 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.360
 No Seriously dangerous little fix come'm Shimla low name flock behind 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.990
 It's about to come over there, oh yeah, it's the point 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.730
 Limited to the hands hermetically'm drawback Ugo 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.740
 I felt that I could see something out of the map, but I didn't do that. 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.680
 If it doesn't move, par ah 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.329
 It is a destroyer 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.379
 I would like to have a weapon. 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:50.129
 Well because it's a story with a vampire on someone who's not even a high-speed continuous fire system 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:54.959
 I think that it was still usable if it was a manner amplifier normally but after 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:56.200
 The serious story Patchouli was a hindrance It 's an explosion that I've got in the habit of following behind 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.330
 From 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.200
 In addition, the enemy will be launched regardless of whether it is in front of you or not , so the direction of the enemy even if you cross the wall 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.610
 Fired on 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.269
 It's more dangerous if it's in battle that I'm blown away 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.459
 Not Do not Monkey Kke I was not in De' not fall on ray 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.190
 Well, I 'm going to double the speed of the back teeth , so there's a lot of the same thing, so the explanation for the beginning 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.340
 Not at all 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.600
 I think this clash is great c 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.200
 It seemed to be interesting if it was play with Dynamarisa 3d 3x speed 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.289
 There Tteka Somehow said Do has passed one year 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.619
 Certainly when it started 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:37.330
 It seems to be over in 2 months and I did not talk about that 

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:43.500
 I wonder it takes considerable time because both may or may not take time to a certain editing 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.500
 Well the first cause is playing, but it is ha ha ha 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:58.150
 It was buried here underground in fact the day-to-day facts 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:02.160
 It may have been many years since ebf fought against giant creatures in the past. 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.160
 I have nothing to do with it 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:21.529
 This just goes to us further back, which decided to join hands 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.120
 If I'm accidentally shot too much and I'm not a friend, I've been defeating it earlier 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:29.050
 That's the way many showy like a maze that is divided 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.940
 Next episode 20 labyrinth 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.940
 Deadly shotgun disorderly shot
