00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
so to the audience I was diagnosed with

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.059 
so to the audience I was diagnosed with
peyronie's<00:00:05.819> but<00:00:06.480> before<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:07.140> could<00:00:07.560> receive

treatment by PSA skyrocketed I needed to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.670 
treatment by PSA skyrocketed I needed to
have<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> radical<00:00:14.070> prospect<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.790> me<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
have a radical prospect to me now as I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.640 
have a radical prospect to me now as I
recover<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.910> will<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.990> baronies

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
patient would you begin to think about

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
conceivably worsen the condition so I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
conceivably worsen the condition so I
think<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.579> real<00:01:30.329> concern<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:31.020> some

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and see where we are with that over time

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
and see where we are with that over time
now<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> question<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
now the question I think with the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
now the question I think with the
catheter<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.610> it's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
catheter is one that I think it's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
catheter is one that I think it's
controversial<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.380> extent

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
controversial I think to some extent

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
controversial I think to some extent
again<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.909> dr.<00:01:54.390> Levine<00:01:54.869> has

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
again i think is as dr. Levine has

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.090 
again i think is as dr. Levine has
mentioned<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.590> patients<00:01:55.799> who<00:01:56.009> are

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
mentioned there are patients who are

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
mentioned there are patients who are
predisposed<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.570> any<00:01:57.810> sort<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> p<00:01:58.259> nada

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
predisposed to get any sort of p nada

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
predisposed to get any sort of p nada
for<00:01:58.740> matey's<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> catheter<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
for matey's and the catheter in and of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
for matey's and the catheter in and of
itself<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.780> always<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.619> risk

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
itself is not always just the risk

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
itself is not always just the risk
factor<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.820> while<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.689> has<00:02:03.869> been<00:02:04.079> some

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
factor so while there has been some

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
factor so while there has been some
associations<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.219> catheter<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.990> that's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
associations with catheter use that's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
associations with catheter use that's
not<00:02:07.290> exclusively<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> case<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.399> least<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.670> my

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
not exclusively the case at least in my

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.910 
not exclusively the case at least in my
experience
