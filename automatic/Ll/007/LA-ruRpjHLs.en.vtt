so<00:00:09.519> slingshots<00:00:10.030> actually<00:00:10.599> grow<00:00:10.839> on<00:00:10.990> trees<00:00:11.320> and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
so slingshots actually grow on trees and

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.470 
so slingshots actually grow on trees and
a<00:00:12.160> lot<00:00:12.340> of<00:00:12.490> folks<00:00:12.730> have<00:00:13.090> their<00:00:13.269> first

slingshot<00:00:16.180> so<00:00:16.869> today<00:00:17.080> just<00:00:17.110> want<00:00:17.410> to<00:00:17.470> go<00:00:17.560> over

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
slingshot so today just want to go over

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.220 
slingshot so today just want to go over
with<00:00:17.800> you<00:00:17.980> how<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.669> choose<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.390> natural<00:00:19.960> fork

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
with you how to choose a natural fork

with you how to choose a natural fork
slingshot<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.270> just<00:00:23.050> about<00:00:23.470> any<00:00:23.770> tree<00:00:24.250> will

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
slingshot so just about any tree will

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.790 
slingshot so just about any tree will
make<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.300> decent<00:00:25.540> slingshot<00:00:26.169> there's<00:00:26.439> only<00:00:26.680> a

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
make a decent slingshot there's only a

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.639 
make a decent slingshot there's only a
few<00:00:27.099> that<00:00:27.309> you<00:00:27.430> want<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:27.730> avoid<00:00:28.079> to<00:00:29.079> start<00:00:29.469> with

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
few that you want to avoid to start with

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.760

any<00:00:29.950> tree<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.550> makes<00:00:30.759> a<00:00:30.969> fruit<00:00:31.450> or<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:32.169> nut<00:00:32.500> is

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
any tree that makes a fruit or a nut is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.340 
any tree that makes a fruit or a nut is
generally<00:00:33.370> fair<00:00:33.640> game<00:00:33.940> so<00:00:34.690> your<00:00:35.050> Oaks

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
generally fair game so your Oaks

of Bradford pear although it'd probably
work<00:00:50.680> if<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.100> was<00:00:51.190> thick<00:00:51.340> enough<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.840> you're

work if it was thick enough what you're

work if it was thick enough what you're
looking<00:00:53.230> for<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.560> symmetry<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:55.810> can<00:00:56.020> go<00:00:56.110> a

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
looking for is symmetry so you can go a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.840 
looking for is symmetry so you can go a
couple<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.530> routes<00:00:56.680> here<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.310> can<00:00:57.460> look<00:00:57.610> for<00:00:57.820> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
couple of routes here you can look for a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.490 
couple of routes here you can look for a
slingshot<00:00:58.149> that's<00:00:58.690> got<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:58.960> symmetry<00:00:59.350> you

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
slingshot that's got the symmetry you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.430 
slingshot that's got the symmetry you
want<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.940> bark<00:01:01.149> on<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.840> slingshot<00:01:02.320> will

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
want with the bark on the slingshot will

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.920 
want with the bark on the slingshot will
make<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.590> dandy<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.390> simply<00:01:04.390> have<00:01:04.509> to<00:01:04.540> cut<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
make a dandy you simply have to cut the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.539 
make a dandy you simply have to cut the
forks<00:01:05.229> where<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.470> want<00:01:05.619> them<00:01:05.770> cut<00:01:06.399> your

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
forks where you want them cut your

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.459 
forks where you want them cut your
handle<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.909> length<00:01:07.119> do<00:01:07.719> a<00:01:07.750> little<00:01:08.020> shaping<00:01:08.229> on

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
handle to length do a little shaping on

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.429 
handle to length do a little shaping on
the<00:01:08.560> tip<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.740> you've<00:01:08.950> got<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> slingshot<00:01:09.430> frame

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the tip and you've got a slingshot frame

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.870 
the tip and you've got a slingshot frame
this<00:01:11.439> is<00:01:11.590> another<00:01:11.799> example<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.399> one<00:01:12.610> that's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
this is another example of one that's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.450 
this is another example of one that's
pretty<00:01:13.360> good<00:01:13.600> right<00:01:13.810> off<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.320> tree<00:01:14.590> not<00:01:15.310> going

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
pretty good right off the tree not going

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.390 
pretty good right off the tree not going
to<00:01:15.520> take<00:01:15.670> much<00:01:15.850> work<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.890> one<00:01:18.070> here<00:01:18.250> it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
to take much work this one here it's

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.070 
to take much work this one here it's
getting<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.640> little<00:01:18.790> larger<00:01:19.270> you're<00:01:19.930> always

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
getting a little larger you're always

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.570 
getting a little larger you're always
looking<00:01:20.470> for<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.770> same<00:01:20.979> size<00:01:21.250> diameter

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
looking for the same size diameter

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.210 
looking for the same size diameter
prongs<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.440> doesn't<00:01:23.710> matter<00:01:23.860> if<00:01:24.070> they're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
prongs but it doesn't matter if they're

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.480 
prongs but it doesn't matter if they're
off<00:01:24.430> by<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.760> bit<00:01:25.950> finally<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.040> can<00:01:27.190> take<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.460> to

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
off by a bit finally you can take it to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.570 
off by a bit finally you can take it to
the<00:01:27.700> extreme<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:28.420> big<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.440> slingshot<00:01:30.010> from

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
the extreme and big the slingshot from

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.609 
the extreme and big the slingshot from
out<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.030> middle<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:32.049> that's<00:01:32.200> one<00:01:32.350> thing<00:01:32.530> a

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
out of the middle so that's one thing a

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.230 
out of the middle so that's one thing a
lot<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.799> slingshot<00:01:33.280> enthusiasts<00:01:33.790> like<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.060> do

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
lot of slingshot enthusiasts like to do

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.109 
lot of slingshot enthusiasts like to do
is<00:01:34.479> get<00:01:34.690> oversize<00:01:35.320> forks<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.040> carve<00:01:36.820> down

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
is get oversize forks and carve down

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.420 
is get oversize forks and carve down
into<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.510> heartwood<00:01:37.900> two<00:01:38.830> reasons<00:01:39.189> on<00:01:39.310> this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
into the heartwood two reasons on this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.640 
into the heartwood two reasons on this
is<00:01:39.610> fun<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:40.000> carve<00:01:40.150> them<00:01:40.420> into<00:01:40.510> there's<00:01:41.290> often

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
is fun to carve them into there's often

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.070 
is fun to carve them into there's often
much<00:01:41.890> prettier<00:01:42.310> grain<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.030> color<00:01:43.570> patterns

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
much prettier grain and color patterns

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.300 
much prettier grain and color patterns
deeper<00:01:44.560> within<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.950> wood<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.100> go<00:01:48.250> to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
deeper within the wood so when you go to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.010 
deeper within the wood so when you go to
select<00:01:48.460> your<00:01:48.760> fork<00:01:49.060> one<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.600> first<00:01:49.780> things

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
select your fork one of the first things

select your fork one of the first things
you<00:01:50.110> can<00:01:50.260> do<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.010> simply<00:01:51.189> put<00:01:51.460> your<00:01:51.490> hand

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
you can do is you simply put your hand

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.280 
you can do is you simply put your hand
up<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.090> tree<00:01:52.270> how<00:01:52.450> does<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.750> feel<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.170> your

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
up on the tree how does it feel in your

it's<00:02:37.450> probably<00:02:37.750> fair<00:02:37.930> game<00:02:38.790> whether<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.970> go

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
it's probably fair game whether you go

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's probably fair game whether you go
big<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.600> dig<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:41.050> or<00:02:41.620> find<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.220> fits

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
slingshot from a natural fork so we've

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.620 
slingshot from a natural fork so we've
got<00:02:50.380> one<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.800> bark<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:52.060> felt<00:02:52.300> nice<00:02:52.450> in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
got one here to bark on it felt nice in

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.970 
got one here to bark on it felt nice in
my<00:02:52.720> hand<00:02:52.930> when<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.080> cut<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.350> off<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.560> tree<00:02:53.800> I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
my hand when I cut it off the tree I

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
my hand when I cut it off the tree I
have<00:02:54.610> let<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.820> one<00:02:55.030> cure<00:02:55.240> up<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.420> bit<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
have let this one cure up a bit but you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.230 
have let this one cure up a bit but you
can<00:02:56.020> shoot<00:02:56.140> them<00:02:56.260> green<00:02:56.670> alright<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.940> all<00:02:58.090> I'm

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
way that feels best in my hand I hold

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.290 
way that feels best in my hand I hold
the<00:03:02.290> slingshot<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.830> my<00:03:02.920> right<00:03:03.130> hand<00:03:03.340> right

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300

take<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> pin<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.300> pencil<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.560> just<00:03:08.620> mark

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
take a pin or a pencil and just mark

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.410 
take a pin or a pencil and just mark
where<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.220> think<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.550> fork<00:03:09.790> tip<00:03:10.000> should<00:03:10.209> be

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.390 

alright<00:03:16.450> take<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> look<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.709> look<00:03:18.250> for

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
alright take a look at it look for

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.260 
alright take a look at it look for
symmetry<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.900> looks<00:03:20.050> pretty<00:03:20.260> good<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:25.150> then

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
symmetry it looks pretty good and then

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.330 
symmetry it looks pretty good and then
cut<00:03:25.450> off<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> bits<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.050> don't<00:03:26.260> need<00:03:26.440> now

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
cut off the bits that you don't need now

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.560 
cut off the bits that you don't need now
I'm<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.550> going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.760> use<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.150> saw<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.480> my

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
I'm just going to use the saw in my
