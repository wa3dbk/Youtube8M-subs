00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
we're going to talk about draw shots

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.310 
we're going to talk about draw shots
today<00:00:18.829> you<00:00:19.009> can<00:00:19.369> see<00:00:19.720> this<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.869> a<00:00:20.899> common

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
today you can see this is a common

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.749 
today you can see this is a common
situation<00:00:21.439> where<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.070> would<00:00:22.250> shoot<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.550> ball

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
situation where you would shoot a ball

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.639 
situation where you would shoot a ball
with<00:00:22.910> crawl<00:00:23.300> in<00:00:23.989> order<00:00:24.230> to<00:00:24.290> keep<00:00:24.439> from

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:24.649 
with crawl in order to keep from

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.159 
with crawl in order to keep from
scratching<00:00:24.919> in<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.279> corner<00:00:25.669> pocket<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.630> this

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
scratching in the corner pocket and this

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.549 
scratching in the corner pocket and this
is<00:00:27.380> what<00:00:27.680> I<00:00:27.890> would<00:00:27.950> call<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:29.300> mid-range<00:00:30.169> draw

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
is what I would call a mid-range draw

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.220 
is what I would call a mid-range draw
shot<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.640> here<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.149> can<00:00:32.300> see<00:00:32.329> playing<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.050> 1

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
shot but here you can see playing the 1

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.980 
shot but here you can see playing the 1
ball<00:00:33.470> coming<00:00:33.860> back<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:35.210> length<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.750> table

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
ball coming back the length of the table

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.040 
ball coming back the length of the table
to<00:00:36.830> play<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.040> 8<00:00:37.280> in<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.550> corner<00:00:37.970> this<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:38.900> what

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
to play the 8 in the corner this is what

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.990 
to play the 8 in the corner this is what
I<00:00:39.080> would<00:00:39.170> call<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.500> long<00:00:39.830> draw<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:40.790> any

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
I would call a long draw in any

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.770 
I would call a long draw in any
situation<00:00:41.630> where<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.840> cue<00:00:42.020> ball<00:00:42.200> has<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.280> go

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
situation where the cue ball has to go

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.970 
situation where the cue ball has to go
3/4<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.900> length<00:00:45.080> of<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.260> table<00:00:45.440> or<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.710> full

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
3/4 the length of the table or the full

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.770 
3/4 the length of the table or the full
length<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> table<00:00:46.550> in<00:00:47.360> order<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.630> give

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
length of the table in order to give

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.360 
length of the table in order to give
position<00:00:48.320> it's<00:00:48.530> going<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:48.740> be<00:00:48.829> considered<00:00:49.250> a

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
position it's going to be considered a

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.030 
position it's going to be considered a
long<00:00:49.610> draw<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.900> here's<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.260> same<00:00:51.500> shot<00:00:51.530> from

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
long draw and here's the same shot from

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.240 
long draw and here's the same shot from
a<00:00:52.070> number<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.460> different<00:00:52.550> positions<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.829> this

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
a number of different positions and this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.700 
a number of different positions and this
angle<00:00:55.489> actually<00:00:55.940> brings<00:00:56.210> up<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.480> good<00:00:56.630> point<00:00:56.710> if

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
angle actually brings up a good point if

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.770 
angle actually brings up a good point if
you<00:00:57.829> have<00:00:58.100> an<00:00:58.250> opportunity<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:59.540> shoot<00:00:59.720> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
you have an opportunity to shoot a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.740 
you have an opportunity to shoot a
follow<00:01:00.200> shot<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:01.370> get<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> same<00:01:01.940> position<00:01:02.540> as

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
follow shot to get the same position as

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.740 
follow shot to get the same position as
in<00:01:03.440> some<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.770> these<00:01:03.860> examples<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:05.420> you're

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
in some of these examples here you're

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.180 
in some of these examples here you're
not<00:01:05.930> quite<00:01:06.260> straight<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.860> could<00:01:07.010> actually

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
not quite straight in you could actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.780 
not quite straight in you could actually
play<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:07.790> with<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:09.470> high<00:01:09.680> right<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.310> come

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
play this with with high right and come

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.340 
play this with with high right and come
off<00:01:10.909> with<00:01:11.090> two<00:01:11.180> rails<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.630> get<00:01:11.780> position<00:01:12.050> for

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
off with two rails to get position for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.940 
off with two rails to get position for
the<00:01:12.440> e<00:01:12.470> any<00:01:13.430> time<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.850> can<00:01:14.030> play<00:01:14.210> follow<00:01:15.170> vs.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the e any time you can play follow vs.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.610 
the e any time you can play follow vs.
draw<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.310> your<00:01:16.549> position<00:01:17.350> you're<00:01:18.350> probably

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
draw to your position you're probably

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.000 
draw to your position you're probably
gonna<00:01:18.860> want<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.159> do<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.680> that's<00:01:21.680> because

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
gonna want to do that and that's because

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.920 
gonna want to do that and that's because
simply<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.460> have<00:01:22.670> more<00:01:23.120> control<00:01:23.479> over<00:01:23.600> a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
simply you have more control over a

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.620 
simply you have more control over a
follow<00:01:24.229> shot<00:01:24.320> than<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.799> do<00:01:25.010> over<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:25.970> draw<00:01:26.299> shot

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
follow shot than you do over a draw shot

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.100 
follow shot than you do over a draw shot
but<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.290> lot<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.530> times<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:28.100> have<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.960> have<00:01:29.960> to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
but a lot of times you have to have to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.800 
but a lot of times you have to have to
shoot<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.470> long<00:01:30.680> draw<00:01:31.010> so<00:01:31.850> here's<00:01:32.630> an

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
shoot that long draw so here's an

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.380 
shoot that long draw so here's an
example<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.260> a<00:01:33.380> drill<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.920> use<00:01:34.390> practice

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
example of a drill that I use practice

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.590 
example of a drill that I use practice
on<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.540> regular<00:01:35.930> basis<00:01:36.350> almost<00:01:36.710> daily<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:38.360> long

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
on a regular basis almost daily the long

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.880 
on a regular basis almost daily the long
draw<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:41.000> shot<00:01:41.360> where<00:01:41.890> you're

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
draw this is a shot where you're

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.649 
draw this is a shot where you're
straight<00:01:43.400> down<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> ball<00:01:43.970> follow<00:01:44.360> shot

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
straight down on the ball follow shot

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.270 
straight down on the ball follow shot
won't<00:01:44.900> work<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.470> have<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.770> come<00:01:45.920> back<00:01:46.130> to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
won't work and you have to come back to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.520 
won't work and you have to come back to
the<00:01:46.369> end<00:01:46.549> rail<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:47.479> order<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.840> give<00:01:47.990> position

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the end rail in order to give position

end rail and this is a drill again that
a<00:02:02.180> beginner<00:02:02.570> player<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.140> going<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.409> have<00:02:03.619> much

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
a beginner player is going to have much

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.520 
a beginner player is going to have much
difficulty<00:02:04.310> with<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.720> order<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.990> make

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
difficulty with because in order to make

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.369 
difficulty with because in order to make
this<00:02:07.100> shot<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.759> draw<00:02:08.569> back<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.899> length<00:02:09.229> of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
this shot and draw back the length of

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.280 
this shot and draw back the length of
the<00:02:09.469> table<00:02:09.789> you're<00:02:10.789> going<00:02:10.939> to<00:02:11.029> have<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.359> have

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the table you're going to have to have

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.929 
the table you're going to have to have
pretty<00:02:12.739> good<00:02:12.950> set<00:02:13.129> of<00:02:13.250> skills<00:02:13.610> when<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.849> comes

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
pretty good set of skills when it comes

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.360 
pretty good set of skills when it comes
to<00:02:14.299> draw<00:02:14.540> now<00:02:15.409> in<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.650> situation<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.340> can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
to draw now in this situation you can

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
to draw now in this situation you can
see<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> actually<00:02:17.060> added<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.810> ball<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.379> rail

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
see I actually added a ball to the rail

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.759 
see I actually added a ball to the rail
and<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.819> ball<00:02:20.090> becomes<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.540> target<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.500> what

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
and this ball becomes a target so what

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.089 
and this ball becomes a target so what
I'm<00:02:21.860> doing<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.370> playing<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:24.290> five<00:02:24.560> ball<00:02:24.829> in

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
I'm doing is playing the five ball in

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.250 
I'm doing is playing the five ball in
the<00:02:25.310> corner<00:02:25.549> pocket<00:02:25.640> coming<00:02:26.299> back<00:02:26.480> make

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the corner pocket coming back make

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.199 
the corner pocket coming back make
contact<00:02:27.829> with<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.099> six<00:02:28.370> balls<00:02:28.609> so<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:28.970> six

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
contact with the six balls so the six

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.420 
contact with the six balls so the six
ball<00:02:29.390> became<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.720> target<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.409> situation<00:02:31.189> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
ball became a target in that situation I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.580 
ball became a target in that situation I
just<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.299> show<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.629> type<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.840> control<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
just to show the type of control that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.710 
just to show the type of control that
you<00:02:33.739> can<00:02:33.890> develop<00:02:34.189> by<00:02:34.939> shooting<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:35.420> draw

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
you can develop by shooting that draw

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.030 
you can develop by shooting that draw
shot<00:02:36.609> and<00:02:37.609> this<00:02:37.849> drill<00:02:38.530> actually<00:02:39.530> learned

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
shot and this drill actually learned

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.059 
shot and this drill actually learned
from<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.459> bully<00:02:40.730> Mosconi<00:02:41.239> four<00:02:41.420> years<00:02:41.780> ago<00:02:42.069> it's

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
from a bully Mosconi four years ago it's

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.390 
from a bully Mosconi four years ago it's
kind<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.459> semicircle<00:02:44.319> these<00:02:45.319> are<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> short

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
kind of a semicircle these are a short

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.800 
kind of a semicircle these are a short
to<00:02:46.609> mid-range<00:02:46.879> draw<00:02:47.659> shots<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:49.599> these<00:02:50.599> are

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to mid-range draw shots and these are

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.020 
to mid-range draw shots and these are
important<00:02:51.379> to<00:02:51.650> practice<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:52.430> they<00:02:52.790> come

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
important to practice because they come

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.580 
important to practice because they come
up<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.299> games<00:02:53.599> all<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.530> time<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:55.099> mean<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:55.579> often

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
up in games all the time I mean so often

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.020 
up in games all the time I mean so often
I'll<00:02:57.590> be<00:02:57.709> playing<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.159> game<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.549> three<00:02:58.730> balls

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I'll be playing in a game in three balls

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.670 
I'll be playing in a game in three balls
will<00:02:59.239> be<00:02:59.359> lined<00:02:59.599> up<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.290> they<00:03:00.439> would<00:03:00.620> be

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
will be lined up just like they would be

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.110 
will be lined up just like they would be
in<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:02.060> drill<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.439> love<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.010> shots<00:03:04.879> come

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
in this drill and I love when shots come

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.830 
in this drill and I love when shots come
up<00:03:05.269> in<00:03:05.450> games<00:03:05.959> where<00:03:06.879> they<00:03:07.879> look<00:03:08.180> exactly<00:03:08.450> like

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
up in games where they look exactly like

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.039 
up in games where they look exactly like
a<00:03:08.959> drill<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.439> I've<00:03:09.590> been<00:03:09.769> working<00:03:10.159> on<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
a drill that I've been working on so the

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.160 
a drill that I've been working on so the
semicircle<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:13.220> was<00:03:13.400> one<00:03:13.639> example<00:03:14.599> of<00:03:15.079> it

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
semicircle that was one example of it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.110 
semicircle that was one example of it
here's<00:03:15.409> another<00:03:15.500> one<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.669> can<00:03:16.849> see

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
here's another one and you can see

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.699 
here's another one and you can see
there's<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.780> number<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.169> ways<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.560> in

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
there's a number of ways to get in

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.650 
there's a number of ways to get in
position<00:03:18.829> for<00:03:19.160> each<00:03:19.400> ball<00:03:19.699> this<00:03:20.150> eight<00:03:20.419> ball

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
do here you can see I left myself a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.569 
do here you can see I left myself a
little<00:03:47.359> bit<00:03:47.510> long<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:48.889> to<00:03:49.010> make<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.220> long

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
little bit long so I have to make a long

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.210 
little bit long so I have to make a long
difficult<00:03:50.060> draw<00:03:50.599> shot<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.229> come<00:03:51.709> back<00:03:51.889> again

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
difficult draw shot I come back again

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.420 
difficult draw shot I come back again
get<00:03:53.150> position<00:03:53.599> for<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.530> final<00:03:54.709> ball<00:03:55.069> in<00:03:55.340> the
