jumping<00:01:32.430> over<00:01:32.579> hurdles<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
jumping over hurdles but as you see in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
jumping over hurdles but as you see in
this<00:01:33.659> video<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.380> hurdles<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
this video you don't need hurdles you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.260 
this video you don't need hurdles you
can<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.520> anything<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> can

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can just do it over anything or you can

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.440 
can just do it over anything or you can
do<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.570> air<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.920> new<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.880> like

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
do it over air if I'm new to this I like

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.420 
do it over air if I'm new to this I like
to<00:01:39.570> have

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
to have

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.650 
to have
something<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> jump<00:01:41.730> over<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.480> I<00:01:42.540> know

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
something to jump over just so I know

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.770 
something to jump over just so I know
that<00:01:43.010> I'm<00:01:44.010> jumping<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.330> I'm<00:01:45.450> covering

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that I'm jumping up and I'm covering

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
that I'm jumping up and I'm covering
some<00:01:46.020> distance<00:01:46.440> what<00:01:46.620> I'm<00:01:46.710> doing<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.190> in<00:01:47.880> other

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
some distance what I'm doing so in other

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
some distance what I'm doing so in other
words<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.300> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.510> know<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:48.840> getting

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
words I want to know that I'm getting

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
words I want to know that I'm getting
the<00:01:49.200> best<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.760> would<00:01:51.390> recommend

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the best out of it so I would recommend

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770 
the best out of it so I would recommend
putting<00:01:51.960> something<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:53.450> another<00:01:54.450> thing<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
putting something now another thing that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.170 
putting something now another thing that
you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.580> little<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.000> more

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you can do which is a little bit more

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.640 
you can do which is a little bit more
advanced<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.900> can<00:01:58.050> actually<00:01:58.440> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.620> have

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
advanced as you can actually if you have

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.630 
advanced as you can actually if you have
a<00:01:58.800> good<00:01:59.010> approach

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
a good approach

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360 
a good approach
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.630> put<00:02:00.870> cones<00:02:01.140> between<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.890> strides<00:02:02.190> of

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
you can put cones between the strides of

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.370 
you can put cones between the strides of
your<00:02:02.490> approach<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.120> then<00:02:03.480> between<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
your approach and then between that that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.730 
your approach and then between that that
third<00:02:04.650> stride<00:02:05.010> you<00:02:05.220> lengthen<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.270> two<00:02:06.450> cones

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
third stride you lengthen the two cones

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
third stride you lengthen the two cones
making<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.890> step<00:02:08.430> over<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.970> two<00:02:09.150> cones<00:02:09.390> which

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
making you step over the two cones which

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540 
making you step over the two cones which
will<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.900> obviously<00:02:10.619> longer<00:02:10.920> than<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.280> used

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
will be obviously longer than you used

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.780 
will be obviously longer than you used
to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
to
and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.480> shortening<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.290> comes<00:02:13.530> between

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and then shortening the comes between

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
and then shortening the comes between
your<00:02:14.010> net<00:02:14.160> your<00:02:14.340> last<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.730> starts<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.300> cause

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
your net your last two starts to cause

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.870 
your net your last two starts to cause
you<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.860> steps<00:02:17.130> out<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.520> quick

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you to get this steps out really quick

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.540 
you to get this steps out really quick
um<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.630> give<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> sound<00:02:19.350> demonstration<00:02:20.220> I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
um to give you a sound demonstration I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
um to give you a sound demonstration I
know<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.000> unusual<00:02:21.210> but<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:22.170> here's<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
know this is unusual but but here's a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.680 
know this is unusual but but here's a
kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.520> an<00:02:23.730> approach<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.570> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
kind of what an approach with one to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.900 
kind of what an approach with one to
sound<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.320> we<00:02:25.770> start<00:02:26.040> off<00:02:26.130> running<00:02:26.670> from

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
sound like so we start off running from

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.000 
sound like so we start off running from
from<00:02:27.180> back<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.780> say<00:02:28.230> behind<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> three-point

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
from back up say behind the three-point

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.850 
from back up say behind the three-point
line<00:02:32.060> okay<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.270> given<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.620> little

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
line okay so given that's a little

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.680 
line okay so given that's a little
dramatic<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.790> want<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.180> understand

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
dramatic but I want you to understand

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.480 
dramatic but I want you to understand
that<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.020> time<00:02:37.380> frame<00:02:37.800> between<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.250> third

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that that time frame between the third

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.100 
that that time frame between the third
stride<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> class<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.600> they<00:02:39.780> quicken

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
stride in this class do they quicken

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.410 
stride in this class do they quicken
notice<00:02:40.620> also<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.160> accelerating<00:02:42.000> every

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
notice also that I'm accelerating every

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.000 
notice also that I'm accelerating every
stride<00:02:42.720> though<00:02:43.050> when<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.500> comes<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.770> jumping

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
stride though when it comes to jumping

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
stride though when it comes to jumping
up<00:02:44.100> with<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.340> foot<00:02:44.640> or<00:02:44.880> two<00:02:45.090> feet<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:46.170> always

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
up with one foot or two feet you always

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
up with one foot or two feet you always
want<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.700> your<00:02:47.730> last<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:48.270> stars<00:02:48.510> being

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
want to have your last two stars being

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.570 
want to have your last two stars being
their<00:02:48.900> quickest<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.440> never<00:02:49.770> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> slow

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
their quickest you never want to slow

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.690 
their quickest you never want to slow
down<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.660> never<00:02:51.840> want<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.920> really

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
down and you never want to just really

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
down and you never want to just really
stay<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> same<00:02:54.270> speed<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> always

stay the same speed you want to always
be<00:02:55.470> accelerated<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:57.150> never<00:02:57.360> want<00:02:57.690> to

jump off over too fast of an

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.430 
jump off over too fast of an
acceleration<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.870> want<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> find<00:03:01.260> your

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
acceleration you want to find your

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.830 
acceleration you want to find your
maximum<00:03:02.100> control<00:03:02.550> velocity<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.390> maximum

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
speed that you can jump off of to be to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.720

have<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> successful<00:03:06.660> job<00:03:07.400> okay<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.459> this

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
have a successful job okay so this

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.000 
have a successful job okay so this
videos<00:03:09.090> been<00:03:09.120> running<00:03:09.540> long<00:03:09.870> enough<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.709> I'm

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
videos been running long enough so I'm

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
take you into the gym now and let you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.259 
take you into the gym now and let you
didn't<00:03:13.980> start<00:03:14.159> sorry<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.670> sound<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.180> know

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
didn't start sorry for the sound I know

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.050 
didn't start sorry for the sound I know
it's<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.569> hard<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.870> hear<00:03:16.109> but<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:17.060> would

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
it's a little hard to hear but I would

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.399 
it's a little hard to hear but I would
listen<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.390> couple<00:03:18.659> times<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.019> think<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
listen to couple times and I think that

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.259 
listen to couple times and I think that
you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.650> make<00:03:19.799> everything<00:03:20.040> else<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.609> again

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
you can make everything else so again

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:31.320 
you can make everything else so again
sorry<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.810> good<00:03:22.290> luck

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:57.390 

one<00:03:31.900> two<00:03:35.550> if

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:05:06.070 

right

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.050 

either<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:07.069> start<00:05:07.490> off<00:05:07.639> slower<00:05:07.879> and

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
either you start off slower and

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:36.429 
either you start off slower and
accelerate

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
by how good it took me about too much to

by how good it took me about too much to
master<00:05:41.839> my
