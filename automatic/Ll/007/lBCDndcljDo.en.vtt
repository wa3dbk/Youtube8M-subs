now<00:00:00.719> that<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:01.020> have<00:00:01.050> seen<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.650> different

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
now that you have seen the different

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.130 
now that you have seen the different
parts<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.399> bicycle<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.210> also<00:00:03.540> seen<00:00:03.780> you

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
parts of the bicycle and also seen you

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.450 
parts of the bicycle and also seen you
know<00:00:04.230> what<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.529> right<00:00:04.620> frame<00:00:04.950> size<00:00:05.220> for

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
know what is the right frame size for

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.579 
know what is the right frame size for
you<00:00:05.580> what<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.450> gonna<00:00:06.569> cover<00:00:06.779> today<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.170> to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
you what we're gonna cover today is to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.410 
you what we're gonna cover today is to
show<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.580> actually<00:00:08.790> change<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
show you how you actually change the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.089 
show you how you actually change the
gears<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.960> your<00:00:10.139> bicycle<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:10.980> you

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
gears in your bicycle so how do you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
gears in your bicycle so how do you
shift<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.429> gears<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.360> we're<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> show

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
shift the gears so we're going to show

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110 
shift the gears so we're going to show
you<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.410> two<00:00:13.590> main<00:00:14.070> sets<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.549> parts<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.940> come

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you the two main sets of parts that come

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
you the two main sets of parts that come
in<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> bicycle<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> gear<00:00:16.080> shifting<00:00:16.500> so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
in a bicycle for the gear shifting so

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.200 
in a bicycle for the gear shifting so
the<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.400> set<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.580> parts<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the first set of parts are the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
the first set of parts are the
derailleur<00:00:18.660> which<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> see<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.380> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
derailleur which you see over here so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
derailleur which you see over here so
you<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> front<00:00:20.460> derailleur<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you have the front derailleur here and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.779 
you have the front derailleur here and
the<00:00:21.960> rear<00:00:22.109> derailleur<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the rear derailleur here so this is the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.250 
the rear derailleur here so this is the
first<00:00:24.029> set<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.240> parts<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> second<00:00:25.109> set<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
first set of parts the second set of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
first set of parts the second set of
parts<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.250> shifters<00:00:26.670> which<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
parts are the shifters which you see the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.380 
parts are the shifters which you see the
brake<00:00:28.080> levers<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.179> front<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
brake levers so you have the front and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.939 
brake levers so you have the front and
the<00:00:30.480> rear<00:00:30.599> shifters<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.500> help<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the rear shifters here which help you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.370 
the rear shifters here which help you
actually<00:00:32.130> manage<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.669> gears<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
actually manage the gears in the back so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
actually manage the gears in the back so
before<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.850> showing<00:00:36.300> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
before we actually go into showing you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
before we actually go into showing you
how<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> gear<00:00:36.989> system<00:00:37.350> really<00:00:37.500> works<00:00:37.829> we

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
how this gear system really works we

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
how this gear system really works we
thought<00:00:38.489> we'll<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.820> show<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> some

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
thought we'll actually show you some

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
thought we'll actually show you some
theory<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.739> better<00:00:40.890> understand<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
theory one to better understand how this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
theory one to better understand how this
gear<00:00:41.969> shifting<00:00:42.329> works<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.320> shall<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
gear shifting works so we shall do that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
gear shifting works so we shall do that
now<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> till<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.719> were<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.289> talking

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
now so till now we were actually talking

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.010 
now so till now we were actually talking
about<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> front<00:00:47.969> derailleur<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
about when the front derailleur is in is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
about when the front derailleur is in is
a<00:00:49.050> smaller<00:00:49.440> string<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
a smaller string which is when it's in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
a smaller string which is when it's in
at<00:00:50.910> number<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.360> gear<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.710> move<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
at number one gear when you move the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.330 
at number one gear when you move the
front<00:00:53.670> derailleur<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:55.020> number<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.500> then

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
front derailleur to two number two then

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
front derailleur to two number two then
the<00:00:56.489> best<00:00:56.640> range<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> rear

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the best range would be to have the rear

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.479 
the best range would be to have the rear
derailleur<00:00:58.079> between<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> second<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
derailleur between the second and the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
derailleur between the second and the
fifth<00:00:59.699> ring<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> ideal<00:01:01.050> range<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
fifth ring so this is the ideal range in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
fifth ring so this is the ideal range in
which<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> should<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> similarly<00:01:03.570> when

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
which it should be and similarly when

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570 
which it should be and similarly when
you<00:01:04.409> move<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> front<00:01:04.949> derailleur<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you move the front derailleur to the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
you move the front derailleur to the
biggest<00:01:05.970> string<00:01:06.299> which<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
biggest string which is when you put it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160 
biggest string which is when you put it
to<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> third<00:01:07.740> gear<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.970> idle<00:01:09.240> range<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.600> for

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
to the third gear the idle range is for

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.240 
to the third gear the idle range is for
the<00:01:10.290> rear<00:01:10.439> derailleur<00:01:10.619> it'll<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the rear derailleur it'll be in the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
the rear derailleur it'll be in the
fourth<00:01:11.490> ring<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> seventh<00:01:12.540> ring<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.200> this

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fourth ring to the seventh ring so this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
fourth ring to the seventh ring so this
this<00:01:13.770> ranges<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this ranges are actually to show you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
this ranges are actually to show you
that<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.040> actually<00:01:17.430> beyond<00:01:18.060> these

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that if you are actually beyond these

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
that if you are actually beyond these
ranges<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> possibility<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
ranges then there is a possibility of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
ranges then there is a possibility of
the<00:01:20.610> chain<00:01:20.850> being<00:01:21.540> entangled<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> chain

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the chain being entangled of the chain

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
the chain being entangled of the chain
actually<00:01:23.040> coming<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.210> chain<00:01:24.450> wheel

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
actually coming out of the chain wheel

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually coming out of the chain wheel
because<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.530> instance<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
because for instance if you have you

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
because for instance if you have you
know<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.320> front<00:01:28.560> derailleur<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.950> at

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
know your your front derailleur is at

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
know your your front derailleur is at
the<00:01:29.460> number<00:01:29.700> three<00:01:29.909> gear<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:31.259> rear

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the number three gear and your rear

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
the number three gear and your rear
derailleur<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.979> number<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
derailleur that number one that's a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
derailleur that number one that's a
really<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.229> wide<00:01:34.619> angle<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
really really you know wide angle for

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
really really you know wide angle for
the<00:01:35.430> chain<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> actually<00:01:36.150> handle<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.020> there

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the chain to actually handle it so there

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
the chain to actually handle it so there
is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> tension<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> chain<00:01:38.280> when

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is a lot of tension on the chain when

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
is a lot of tension on the chain when
that<00:01:39.810> sort<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.350> gear<00:01:40.829> ratio<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that sort of a gear ratio is put so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
that sort of a gear ratio is put so
obviously<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.200> chain<00:01:43.680> rather<00:01:43.890> break<00:01:44.220> or

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
obviously that the chain rather break or

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
obviously that the chain rather break or
get<00:01:44.549> entangled<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:46.020> why<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.409> recommend

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
get entangled so that's why we recommend

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.399 
get entangled so that's why we recommend
these<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.850> gear<00:01:48.030> ratios<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
these kind of gear ratios so that it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.490 
these kind of gear ratios so that it's
more<00:01:49.680> comfortable<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> ride<00:01:51.500> now

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
more comfortable for you to ride now

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.289 
more comfortable for you to ride now
that<00:01:52.710> we've<00:01:52.860> seen<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.220> shifting<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:53.970> theory

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that we've seen the shifting and theory

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.399 
that we've seen the shifting and theory
we<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we are actually going to see it in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
we are actually going to see it in
practical<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.310> bike<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
practical on this bike which is the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
practical on this bike which is the
riders<00:01:57.299> norm<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.130> over<00:01:59.399> here

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
riders norm so as you can see over here

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.730 
riders norm so as you can see over here
we<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> shifters<00:02:00.899> which<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.350> mentioned

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we have the shifters which we mentioned

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
we have the shifters which we mentioned
earlier<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.570> left<00:02:03.780> shifter

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
earlier so you have the left shifter

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
earlier so you have the left shifter
here<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:04.979> Shiplake<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.450> left

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
here and the right Shiplake up the left

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
here and the right Shiplake up the left
shift<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.049> handles<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.710> front<00:02:07.950> derailleur

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
shift of handles the front derailleur

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.059 
shift of handles the front derailleur
and<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.539> shifter<00:02:09.929> handles<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.920> vo

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and the right shifter handles the vo

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.510 
and the right shifter handles the vo
derailleur

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
derailleur

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.500 
derailleur
so<00:02:11.940> that's<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> manage<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.780> gears

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
so that's how you manage the gears

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.330 
so that's how you manage the gears
of<00:02:13.750> course<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.110> will<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.739> see<00:02:14.799> how<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
of course we will go and see how the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.069 
of course we will go and see how the
derailleurs<00:02:15.909> well<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.689> these<00:02:16.810> are<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
derailleurs well but these are the

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.399 
derailleurs well but these are the
shifters<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.530> help<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.129> manage<00:02:18.519> your<00:02:18.760> gears

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
shifters that help you manage your gears

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.809 
shifters that help you manage your gears
so<00:02:20.409> this<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.709> how<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:20.920> actually<00:02:21.159> ship<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> gear

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
so this is how we actually ship the gear

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.280 
so this is how we actually ship the gear
so<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.239> see<00:02:22.360> there<00:02:22.510> are<00:02:22.569> two<00:02:22.720> levers<00:02:22.989> here

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
so you can see there are two levers here

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.649 
so you can see there are two levers here
on<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> right<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.760> liver<00:02:25.390> actually

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
on the right so this liver actually

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.170 
on the right so this liver actually
helps<00:02:26.379> you<00:02:26.470> move<00:02:26.620> forward<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:27.730> saw<00:02:27.939> we

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
helps you move forward so as you saw we

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.380 
helps you move forward so as you saw we
just<00:02:28.390> moved<00:02:28.689> from<00:02:28.900> here<00:02:29.110> one<00:02:29.349> two<00:02:29.560> gear<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
just moved from here one two gear to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.990 
just moved from here one two gear to
this<00:02:31.390> obviously<00:02:32.079> still<00:02:32.349> remains<00:02:32.739> at<00:02:33.129> gear<00:02:33.760> one

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
this obviously still remains at gear one

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.020 
this obviously still remains at gear one
so<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.930> front<00:02:35.549> derailleur<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.640> still<00:02:36.939> at

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
so the front derailleur is still at

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.819 
so the front derailleur is still at
number<00:02:37.299> one<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.989> rear<00:02:38.140> derailleur<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.620> that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
number one the rear derailleur is that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.830 
number one the rear derailleur is that
number<00:02:39.099> two<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.939> you<00:02:40.329> know<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.569> is<00:02:40.689> our<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
number two so you know this is our the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.929 
number two so you know this is our the
first<00:02:41.109> ring<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.099> at<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.370> second

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
first ring and this is at the second

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.210 
first ring and this is at the second
ring<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.659> as<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:43.870> move<00:02:43.989> forward<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.069> see

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
ring so as we move forward we can see

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.180 
ring so as we move forward we can see
now<00:02:45.340> we're<00:02:45.519> moving<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.000> gear<00:02:46.150> three<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
now we're moving to the gear three and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.460 
now we're moving to the gear three and
then<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.340> gear<00:02:48.519> 4<00:02:48.790> now<00:02:49.510> before<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.290> move

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
then to gear 4 now before you move

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
then to gear 4 now before you move
forward<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:51.010> gear<00:02:51.220> five<00:02:51.489> six<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.000> seven<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
forward to gear five six and seven you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.780 
forward to gear five six and seven you
need<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.780> actually<00:02:52.959> move<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.859> rear<00:02:54.069> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
need to actually move this the rear the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.180 
need to actually move this the rear the
front<00:02:55.030> ring<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.420> actually<00:02:55.840> move<00:02:56.440> forward<00:02:56.709> so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
front ring to actually move forward so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.690 
front ring to actually move forward so
if<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.579> move<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.849> here<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.599> -<00:02:59.549> then<00:03:00.549> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
if you move it here to here - then you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.670 
if you move it here to here - then you
should<00:03:00.879> actually<00:03:01.030> move<00:03:01.389> forward<00:03:01.629> from<00:03:02.079> four

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
should actually move forward from four

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.800 
should actually move forward from four
to<00:03:02.709> five<00:03:03.069> -<00:03:03.280> six<00:03:03.400> -<00:03:03.519> seven<00:03:03.609> because<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.629> you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
to five - six - seven because if you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.030 
to five - six - seven because if you
don't<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.139> that<00:03:05.349> you're<00:03:05.500> actually<00:03:05.799> going<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
don't do that you're actually going to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.309 
don't do that you're actually going to
go<00:03:06.189> away<00:03:06.519> from<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.329> ideal<00:03:07.659> vanes<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.200> is

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
go away from the ideal vanes that is

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.289 
go away from the ideal vanes that is
there<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.099> need<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.760> idle<00:03:10.060> range

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
there so we need to have the idle range

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.179 
there so we need to have the idle range
that<00:03:10.659> we<00:03:10.810> covered<00:03:11.109> in<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.319> theory<00:03:11.560> where

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
that we covered in the theory where

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.800 
that we covered in the theory where
before<00:03:12.639> you<00:03:12.849> move<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.299> next<00:03:13.569> gear<00:03:13.689> you

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
before you move to the next gear you

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
before you move to the next gear you
need<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:13.989> make<00:03:14.200> sure<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.769> angles<00:03:15.220> are

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
need to make sure that the angles are

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.140 
need to make sure that the angles are
right<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.359> we<00:03:16.780> move<00:03:16.810> back<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.160> we're<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.489> you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
right so we move back so we're at you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.839 
right so we move back so we're at you
know<00:03:19.180> gear<00:03:19.480> 4<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.680> move<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.069> number<00:03:21.549> five

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
know gear 4 here so move to number five

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.199 
know gear 4 here so move to number five
here<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.440> then<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.560> move<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.769> six<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.519> then

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
here and then we move to six and then

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.229 
here and then we move to six and then
you<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.049> we<00:03:26.379> can<00:03:26.410> move<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.010> third<00:03:28.000> ring

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
you know we can move to the third ring

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.619 
you know we can move to the third ring
in<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.569> front<00:03:29.129> derailleur<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.370> then<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.449> move

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
in the front derailleur and then we move

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.720 
in the front derailleur and then we move
back<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.230> seven<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.519> how<00:03:33.669> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
back to the seven so this is how you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.379 
back to the seven so this is how you
achieve<00:03:33.940> with<00:03:34.239> twenty-one<00:03:34.659> speed<00:03:35.699> so<00:03:36.699> now<00:03:36.849> we

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
achieve with twenty-one speed so now we

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.119 
achieve with twenty-one speed so now we
just<00:03:37.569> saw<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.810> how<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.319> move<00:03:38.590> from<00:03:38.769> the

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
just saw that how you move from the

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.220 
just saw that how you move from the
ratio<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.430> 1<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.909> 1/2<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.810> know<00:03:40.930> three<00:03:41.199> and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
ratio the 1 and 1/2 you know three and

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.259 
ratio the 1 and 1/2 you know three and
seven<00:03:41.560> which<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.220> how<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.519> achieve<00:03:42.729> to<00:03:43.120> any

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
seven which is how you achieve to any

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.089 
seven which is how you achieve to any
one<00:03:43.419> speed<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.199> now<00:03:44.349> we<00:03:44.409> will<00:03:44.530> also<00:03:44.680> see<00:03:44.949> how

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
one speed so now we will also see how

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.270 
one speed so now we will also see how
you<00:03:45.159> go<00:03:45.430> back<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:46.299> right<00:03:47.199> now<00:03:47.379> we<00:03:47.440> are<00:03:47.560> at<00:03:47.709> 3<00:03:47.949> in

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
you go back so right now we are at 3 in

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.069 
you go back so right now we are at 3 in
the<00:03:48.549> front<00:03:48.669> derailleur<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.209> seven<00:03:49.690> over<00:03:49.900> here

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the front derailleur and seven over here

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.930 
the front derailleur and seven over here
so<00:03:50.709> we're<00:03:50.889> actually<00:03:51.040> going<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.340> move<00:03:51.489> from<00:03:51.669> two

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
so we're actually going to move from two

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.349 
so we're actually going to move from two
I<00:03:52.209> mean<00:03:52.810> from<00:03:52.930> three<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:53.349> two<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.639> know<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
I mean from three to two so you know the

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.899 
I mean from three to two so you know the
press<00:03:55.629> tell<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.900> over<00:03:56.019> here<00:03:56.199> on<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.440> top<00:03:56.909> so

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
press tell you over here on the top so

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.479 
press tell you over here on the top so
for<00:03:58.120> move<00:03:58.269> from<00:03:58.449> three<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.930> two<00:03:59.109> over<00:03:59.949> here<00:04:00.159> as

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
for move from three to two over here as

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.369 
for move from three to two over here as
well<00:04:00.699> how<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.120> move<00:04:01.389> back<00:04:01.629> is<00:04:01.870> by<00:04:01.989> pressing

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
well how you move back is by pressing

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.530 
well how you move back is by pressing
this<00:04:02.500> lever<00:04:02.739> here<00:04:03.010> they<00:04:03.549> move<00:04:03.729> from<00:04:03.849> 7<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.269> 6

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
this lever here they move from 7 to 6

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.309 
this lever here they move from 7 to 6
into<00:04:05.409> 5<00:04:06.030> into<00:04:07.030> 4<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:09.389> then<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.750> move<00:04:11.290> back

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
into 5 into 4 and then you move back

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.770 
into 5 into 4 and then you move back
here<00:04:11.769> from<00:04:11.949> 2<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:13.569> 1

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
here from 2 to 1

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.900 
here from 2 to 1
and<00:04:14.870> then<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.650> move<00:04:15.800> from<00:04:15.950> four<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.810> three<00:04:18.910> to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
and then you move from four to three to

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.040 
and then you move from four to three to
two<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.680> then<00:04:21.680> back<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.100> one<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.300> this<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:23.870> how

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
two and then back to one so this is how

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.629 
two and then back to one so this is how
you<00:04:24.110> move<00:04:24.320> back<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.800> forth<00:04:25.040> with<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> gears

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
you move back and forth with the gears

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.730 
you move back and forth with the gears
now<00:04:26.240> there<00:04:26.600> are<00:04:26.690> few<00:04:26.870> things<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.260> keep<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.530> mind

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
now there are few things to keep in mind

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.980 
now there are few things to keep in mind
when<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.040> do<00:04:28.190> this

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
when you do this

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.970 
when you do this
the<00:04:29.990> first<00:04:30.230> thing<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.620> need<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.770> obviously

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
the first thing is you need to obviously

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.240 
the first thing is you need to obviously
wait<00:04:31.580> before<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.150> next<00:04:32.410> gear<00:04:33.410> shifted<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.070> for

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
wait before the next gear shifted so for

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.490 
wait before the next gear shifted so for
instance<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.150> look<00:04:35.300> over<00:04:35.540> here<00:04:35.750> when<00:04:36.350> I'm

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
instance if you look over here when I'm

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500 
instance if you look over here when I'm
moving<00:04:36.800> from<00:04:36.950> one<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.460> two<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:37.910> two<00:04:38.030> three<00:04:38.300> I

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
moving from one to two and two three I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.200 
moving from one to two and two three I
first<00:04:39.169> moved<00:04:39.380> from<00:04:39.620> one<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.980> two<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.910> then<00:04:41.090> I

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
first moved from one to two and then I

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.050 
first moved from one to two and then I
wait<00:04:41.419> for<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:42.190> chain<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.310> actually<00:04:43.669> move<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
wait for the chain to actually move and

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.930 
wait for the chain to actually move and
then<00:04:44.720> move<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.830> third<00:04:46.100> one<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.820> need

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
then move to the third one so you need

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.490 
then move to the third one so you need
to<00:04:47.030> give<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.360> pause<00:04:47.630> before<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.110> move<00:04:48.350> from

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
to give it a pause before you move from

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.100 
to give it a pause before you move from
one<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:49.130> two<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.340> three<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.850> four<00:04:49.880> or<00:04:50.240> five<00:04:50.450> so

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
one to two to three to four or five so

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.600 
one to two to three to four or five so
that's<00:04:51.320> very<00:04:51.530> important<00:04:52.070> because<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.400> chain

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
that's very important because the chain

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.940 
that's very important because the chain
actually<00:04:53.000> has<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.390> move<00:04:53.570> from<00:04:53.840> from<00:04:54.440> one<00:04:54.710> ring

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
actually has to move from from one ring

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.440 
actually has to move from from one ring
to<00:04:55.100> another<00:04:55.340> before<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.270> actually

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
to another before it can actually

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.810 
to another before it can actually
function<00:04:56.810> correctly<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:58.250> other<00:04:58.460> thing<00:04:58.700> to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
function correctly the other thing to

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.210 
function correctly the other thing to
keep<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.000> mind<00:04:59.120> is<00:04:59.480> never<00:04:59.870> used<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.800> shifters

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
keep in mind is never used the shifters

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.370 
keep in mind is never used the shifters
when<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.669> bicycle<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.390> in<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.630> stationary<00:05:03.140> mode

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
when the bicycle is in a stationary mode

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.740 
when the bicycle is in a stationary mode
the<00:05:03.980> bus<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.150> be<00:05:05.270> riding<00:05:05.630> the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
the bus you have to be riding the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.600 
the bus you have to be riding the
bicycle<00:05:06.229> for<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.800> use<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.190> shifters

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
bicycle for you to use the shifters

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.460 
bicycle for you to use the shifters
because<00:05:08.180> otherwise<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.780> shifters<00:05:09.169> are<00:05:09.350> going

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
because otherwise the shifters are going

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.100 
because otherwise the shifters are going
to<00:05:09.530> get<00:05:09.650> stuck<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.790> will<00:05:11.000> not<00:05:11.150> work<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:12.050> you

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
to get stuck and it will not work so you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.780 
to get stuck and it will not work so you
have<00:05:12.200> to<00:05:12.380> ensure<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.100> always<00:05:13.490> used

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
have to ensure that it's always used

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.969 
have to ensure that it's always used
when<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:14.750> when<00:05:15.080> you're<00:05:15.200> riding<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.830> not

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
when it's when you're riding it and not

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.740 
when it's when you're riding it and not
when<00:05:16.220> it's<00:05:16.370> when<00:05:16.850> your<00:05:17.000> bicycle<00:05:17.450> is<00:05:17.540> in<00:05:17.690> a

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
when it's when your bicycle is in a

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.830 
when it's when your bicycle is in a
stage<00:05:17.990> free<00:05:18.169> mode<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:20.060> as<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.330> can<00:05:20.450> see<00:05:20.510> right

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
stage free mode so as you can see right

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.930 
stage free mode so as you can see right
now<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.470> chain<00:05:21.710> is<00:05:21.860> in<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.070> largest<00:05:22.669> string

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
now the chain is in the largest string

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.060 
now the chain is in the largest string
in<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.150> rear<00:05:23.330> derailleur<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:24.290> which<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.650> we

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
in the rear derailleur so which is we

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.210 
in the rear derailleur so which is we
are<00:05:25.160> at<00:05:25.280> number<00:05:25.370> one<00:05:25.780> as<00:05:26.780> I<00:05:27.320> move<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.830> shifters

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
are at number one as I move the shifters

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.950 
are at number one as I move the shifters
here<00:05:28.460> right<00:05:28.700> now<00:05:28.880> we<00:05:28.940> moved<00:05:29.240> for<00:05:29.390> one<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:29.750> two

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
here right now we moved for one to two

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960 
here right now we moved for one to two
you<00:05:30.560> can<00:05:30.740> see<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:31.010> chain<00:05:31.250> has<00:05:31.430> also<00:05:31.610> moved

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
you can see the chain has also moved

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.840 
you can see the chain has also moved
from<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.479> largest<00:05:33.229> ring<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.010> second<00:05:34.669> ring

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
from the largest ring to the second ring

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.300 
from the largest ring to the second ring
and<00:05:35.720> when<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.960> move<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.350> third<00:05:36.620> then<00:05:37.190> it

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
and when you move to the third then it

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.250 
and when you move to the third then it
moves<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.729> third<00:05:38.000> ring<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.780> this<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.110> how

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
moves to the third ring so this is how

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.590 
moves to the third ring so this is how
the<00:05:40.250> mechanism<00:05:40.820> happens<00:05:41.180> when<00:05:41.330> you<00:05:41.419> actually

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
the mechanism happens when you actually

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.350 
the mechanism happens when you actually
use<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.140> shifters<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.919> chain<00:05:43.130> moves<00:05:43.850> forward

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
use the shifters the chain moves forward

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.210 
use the shifters the chain moves forward
you<00:05:44.539> know<00:05:44.630> right<00:05:44.810> now<00:05:44.990> we<00:05:45.050> are<00:05:45.229> at<00:05:45.350> number<00:05:45.830> four

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
you know right now we are at number four

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.480 
you know right now we are at number four
and<00:05:46.490> now<00:05:47.180> at<00:05:47.330> number<00:05:47.360> five<00:05:47.870> so<00:05:48.740> as<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.340> move

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
and now at number five so as you move

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.210 
and now at number five so as you move
back<00:05:49.550> as<00:05:49.970> well<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.240> shifter<00:05:50.600> you<00:05:51.289> put<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.860> it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
back as well the shifter you put and it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.770 
back as well the shifter you put and it
comes<00:05:52.430> back<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.789> four<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.150> can<00:05:53.300> also<00:05:53.419> see<00:05:53.660> the

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
comes back to four you can also see the

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.870 
comes back to four you can also see the
chain<00:05:54.020> move<00:05:54.260> from<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:55.160> fifth<00:05:55.400> ring<00:05:55.640> the

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
chain move from the fifth ring the

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.680 
chain move from the fifth ring the
fourth<00:05:56.090> ring<00:05:56.300> then<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.320> third<00:05:58.510> then<00:05:59.510> to

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
fourth ring then to the third then to

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.020 
fourth ring then to the third then to
the<00:05:59.780> second<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.320> then<00:06:00.830> back<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:01.490> first<00:06:01.640> so

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
the second and then back to the first so

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.880 
the second and then back to the first so
this<00:06:02.600> is<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:02.780> same<00:06:02.960> way<00:06:03.169> it<00:06:03.229> happens<00:06:03.650> for<00:06:03.770> the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
this is the same way it happens for the

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.100 
this is the same way it happens for the
front<00:06:04.100> derailleur<00:06:04.280> as<00:06:04.640> well<00:06:04.850> and<00:06:05.120> that's<00:06:05.930> how

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
front derailleur as well and that's how

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:26.680 
front derailleur as well and that's how
the<00:06:06.289> whole<00:06:06.560> mechanism<00:06:07.460> works

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.960 

so<00:06:27.170> what<00:06:27.350> are<00:06:27.440> you<00:06:27.530> waiting<00:06:27.830> for<00:06:27.860> get<00:06:28.550> yourself
