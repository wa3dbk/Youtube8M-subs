to<00:00:55.199> work<00:00:55.379> with

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to work with

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
to work with
you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.489> typical<00:00:56.870> standard<00:00:57.870> level

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you have your typical standard level

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
you have your typical standard level
system<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.829> through<00:00:59.039> ten<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> get

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
system one through ten but when you get

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
system one through ten but when you get
into<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> tones<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.309> bit

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
into the tones it's a little bit

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
into the tones it's a little bit
different<00:01:04.280> something<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.970> adjust

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
different something that you can adjust

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020 
different something that you can adjust
to<00:01:06.479> certainly<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.799> first<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.549> call<00:01:08.790> their

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to certainly but first they call their

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.370 
to certainly but first they call their
their<00:01:09.330> nature<00:01:09.720> series<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> end

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
their nature series would be the end

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
their nature series would be the end
nature<00:01:13.380> plus<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> double<00:01:14.460> n

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
nature plus would be like a double n

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.990 
nature plus would be like a double n
series<00:01:15.799> then<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
series then you get into something that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
series then you get into something that
they<00:01:18.150> call<00:01:18.420> cedar<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.409> their<00:01:19.560> cool

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
they call cedar which are their cool

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.420 
they call cedar which are their cool
tones<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.530> listed<00:01:22.740> bamboo

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
tones and then they have listed bamboo

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
tones and then they have listed bamboo
and<00:01:24.299> bamboo<00:01:24.470> would<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> beige<00:01:25.950> gold<00:01:26.840> next

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and bamboo would be the beige gold next

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
and bamboo would be the beige gold next
would<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.140> honey<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.890> honey<00:01:29.729> gets<00:01:30.000> considered

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

considered intense brown next is oak

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.690 
considered intense brown next is oak
which<00:01:41.490> would<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> modern<00:01:42.270> brunettes<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
which would be the modern brunettes and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.020 
which would be the modern brunettes and
then<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.030> teak<00:01:45.979> which<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.460> red

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
then you have teak which would be red

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.289 
then you have teak which would be red
Browns<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.759> autumn

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Browns and then you get into this autumn

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.580 
Browns and then you get into this autumn
leaf<00:01:51.570> series<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> coppers<00:01:54.590> copper

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
leaf series which are the coppers copper

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.639 
leaf series which are the coppers copper
gold<00:01:55.909> red<00:01:56.909> copper<00:01:58.310> red<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.790> violet<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
gold red copper red and violet so you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
gold red copper red and violet so you
can<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.430> bit<00:02:02.579> different<00:02:02.790> than

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can see it's a little bit different than

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
can see it's a little bit different than
what<00:02:03.509> some<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> may<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.170> used<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
what some of you may be used to but

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.639 
what some of you may be used to but
certainly<00:02:05.430> something<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:07.409> worked

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
certainly something that can be worked

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.770 
certainly something that can be worked
with<00:02:08.989> typically<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.379> color<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:11.039> mixed

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
with typically the color is mixed

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.590 
with typically the color is mixed
two-to-one<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
two-to-one so

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.360 
two-to-one so
cause<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> tube<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.620> 2.1<00:02:17.620> ounces<00:02:18.160> of

cause in a tube that is 2.1 ounces of

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.840 
cause in a tube that is 2.1 ounces of
colored<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.470> mix<00:02:20.710> one<00:02:21.100> part<00:02:21.130> color<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
colored and you mix one part color to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
colored and you mix one part color to
two<00:02:22.030> parts<00:02:22.360> developer<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.590> developers<00:02:24.130> are<00:02:24.310> a
