paintball teams we get to throw a lot of
terms<00:00:07.350> out<00:00:07.589> there<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> lot<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.980> cliches<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.610> it

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
terms out there a lot of cliches at it

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.970

but<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.840> know<00:00:09.900> if<00:00:10.050> just<00:00:10.230> X<00:00:10.380> Factor's<00:00:10.740> failed

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
but you know if just X Factor's failed

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.470 
but you know if just X Factor's failed
to<00:00:11.070> make<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.219> cut<00:00:11.429> class<00:00:11.700> straight<00:00:11.940> Vince<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to make the cut class straight Vince and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.910 
to make the cut class straight Vince and
then<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> professor's<00:00:13.320> that's<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
then is the professor's that's just the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
then is the professor's that's just the
straight-up<00:00:14.070> truth<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:15.330> know<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.480> think

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
straight-up truth and you know I think

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.760 
straight-up truth and you know I think
that<00:00:15.809> comes<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> same<00:00:16.500> thing<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.710> was

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
that comes with the same thing I was

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
that comes with the same thing I was
talking<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> pure<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:18.630> haven't

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
talking about what a pure they haven't

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
talking about what a pure they haven't
been<00:00:19.020> able<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.320> practice<00:00:19.650> people<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.430> know

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
been able to practice people you know

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
been able to practice people you know
and<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.060> money<00:00:21.240> factor<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.810> everything

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and it's a money factor it's everything

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
and it's a money factor it's everything
going<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> world<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.029> know

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
going on in the world but you know

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.580 
going on in the world but you know
they're<00:00:24.300> only<00:00:24.420> able<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> practice<00:00:25.050> themselves

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
they're only able to practice themselves

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.500 
they're only able to practice themselves
so<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.609> doesn't<00:00:26.939> give<00:00:27.029> them<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> different<00:00:27.330> look

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so it doesn't give them a different look

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.509 
so it doesn't give them a different look
it<00:00:27.960> doesn't<00:00:28.289> give<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.680> different<00:00:28.920> tendency

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it doesn't give them different tendency

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
it doesn't give them different tendency
for<00:00:29.760> different<00:00:30.029> players<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.929> they're<00:00:31.410> going

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
for different players so they're going

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.549 
for different players so they're going
at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> same<00:00:32.189> tempo<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.660> against<00:00:34.260> their

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
at the same tempo you know against their

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380 
at the same tempo you know against their
sin<00:00:34.800> guys<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.790> come<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.120> against

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
sin guys and then they come out against

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.139 
sin guys and then they come out against

grazie I agree you know but the fees is
like<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.770> x<00:00:47.010> factor<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.520> not

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
like I think that the x factor or not

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
like I think that the x factor or not
that<00:00:47.850> invade<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> game<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.899> times

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that invade the game of all to all times

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
that invade the game of all to all times
go<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.920> X<00:00:50.100> Factor<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.210> need

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
go an X Factor it's not like they need

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.080 
go an X Factor it's not like they need
to<00:00:51.480> learn<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:52.110> paintball<00:00:53.039> knowledge<00:00:53.640> they

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to learn more paintball knowledge they

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
to learn more paintball knowledge they
do<00:00:54.149> need<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> stay<00:00:54.629> crisp<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> need<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
do need to stay crisp that you need to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.869 
do need to stay crisp that you need to
see<00:00:55.559> those<00:00:55.680> looks<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.460> different<00:00:56.760> things

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
see those looks the different things

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.069 
see those looks the different things
that<00:00:56.969> teams<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.329> thrown<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.600> each<00:00:57.690> other<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that teams with thrown at each other and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
that teams with thrown at each other and
you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.949> teams<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.280> California<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you know the teams in California and the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.279 
you know the teams in California and the
west<00:01:00.510> coast<00:01:00.690> definitely<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
west coast definitely have that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.070 
west coast definitely have that
advantage<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.809> just

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
advantage but I really think it's just

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630 
advantage but I really think it's just
it's<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> ask<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> desire

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's like they have to ask that desire

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's like they have to ask that desire
yeah<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.720> straight<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.470> okay<00:01:07.830> well

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
yeah that's straight up like okay well

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.410 
yeah that's straight up like okay well
we<00:01:08.159> came<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> win<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.640> event<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.270> they

ever I guess your rates in just in that

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
ever I guess your rates in just in that
can<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.900> back<00:01:25.170> staring<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.159> just
