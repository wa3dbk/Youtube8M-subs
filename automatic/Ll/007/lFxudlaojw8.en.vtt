00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi my name is ilya on or led and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.060
 Today we will talk about the book Gale 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 forman 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 if I stay the same name and UCAB 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 film versions that are just today 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 out in the Russian rental and know 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 Now there will be a country of eternal me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
 I brought a book with me to Moscow 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 from peter to show it in this video 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 though I read it a long time ago but 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 or else let's say I will tell you right away 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 what I liked in principle and the book and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 the film and this deploy masterpiece especially 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 I can not call that is a book of course 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.860
 tears, too, begins to squeeze I could 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.700
 read or only the second time 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 explaining why I drive my car 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.629
 have a driving license and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 i am very impressionable person yes i am 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 sometimes on from the pub driver point ru 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 I read traffic reports 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 accidents so on but for me this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 as here is a block of some kind, I understand that this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 It happened but I do not take well to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 artwork books in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.920
 literature is like this for me 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.960
 leaning on his nose 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.489
 clear and when i started reading gale 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 forman if i stay and there just 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.560
 it was still a super awful accident 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.990
 where happened what happened this to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 oh why I can't read it because 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 what is it all imprinted in my brain 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 Tomorrow I have a car today. 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.400
 to drive I don't want to read anything but in 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 the ultimate but a shot 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.509
 a kind of block against all that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.939
 going on in the book and I have turned and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 read and i'm true i did this 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 film adaptation because if i had this 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 I probably didn’t react 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.970
 today as most of the hall when in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 late finish all the same 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.310
 ha ha and started for full death go 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 happened at all but so here's the book 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 tells about the life of a girl the mosque was 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.780
 EMI did not name it ready because I 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.149
 me in one tree hill head but died in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.399
 crash parents die and it's not 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 spoiler because it is clear from 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.479
 the trailer is understandable from the description of the view 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.719
 so on and she has to decide 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.719
 it will remain on the planet earth to live or 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.280
 she will leave this land with her 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.250
 family 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.250
 and we go here this is the acceptance path 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.740
 decisions along with the media in this book movie and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.810
 in the end she makes her choice and 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.640
 it seemed to me today as a group back 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.930
 what else is the second part of this book that is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.250
 type continuation 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.260
 and probably sometime I am before her 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 I will get but let's collect two we 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.220
 because about the book in principle, many 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.680
 know its plot and I already wrote it briefly 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.330
 I liked this awesome contact 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.610
 good organization not terrific 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 just good organization excellent 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.110
 the actors played their roles 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.030
 great chloe sea or moretz 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.310
 coped with my role me very 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.380
 liked the worlds and us first and us this 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.500
 an actress who plays moms and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.400
 redhead so I did not start falling in love 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.930
 fall in love 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.959
 even when I started watching the show 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 murder then I saw her in world war 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.860
 z 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.319
 and now she just struck me every 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.840
 since all of her heroines are beautiful and they 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.880
 such wise harsh such tell you 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.160
 how to do it how to do it such 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.560
 all strong women and I really like 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.400
 game and sense of proportion and we will be mine 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.680
 man ok through blood for the near future 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.329
 the film is screened almost step by step that's how 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.769
 in the book everything was pisa there are small 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.810
 changes but not so small 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.390
 they are invisible and absolutely name is very 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.910
 I liked it like the filmmakers 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.920
 organically connected memories 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.390
 which she kind of remembers and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.730
 recycle your headed taking 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.130
 the decision is what happens after the accident 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.660
 already like this very all of this 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.790
 beautifully shown sandra 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.380
 very cool i hope all the songs to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 the film program will be sleep tracks 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.310
 buy because i want to listen to it yet 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.079
 definitely times 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.150
 go back like a cartoon 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.440
 I was dedicated to waiting very much I had so 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.299
 and so this thursday i must say 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.370
 this i gotta watch this i gotta this 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.920
 this is it and i was really looking forward to these films and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.500
 now i'm on my run 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.609
 I read the maze last night 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.310
 first 50 pages 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.799
 Today I read another 200 sapsans 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.320
 pages and I really like it for now 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.670
 the book it holds the film will be the same 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.340
 dynamic and cool because i 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.379
 generally can not 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.720
 you know what will happen in the end and how I left 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.930
 from and forest and as a plow running rent 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.459
 but go to the cinema watch a movie can 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.810
 even a book does not count just react 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.239
 adequately what is happening on the screen 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.889
 because today I sat in five stars 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.389
 on Paveletskaya where I hate me 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.360
 already all because a woman who 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.919
 sold me a sprite she wanted less 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.780
 I did not give less money 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.570
 money and whoever we have it's not true I'm on 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.220
 you offended me then a woman 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.160
 which took this sprite to my 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.930
 spilled on the floor and in general it seems to me in 5 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.940
 I will perform the fishing line 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.160
 and people reacted very strangely 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.110
 I was jealous I was just a man 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360
 dies on played wore chic giggle 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.639
 us eating our otherwise light to the bottom of the clay 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.110
 I just wanted to throw popcorn in my face 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.150
 person at birth I had 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.130
 such a desire so go to the movies 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.540
 watch this movie read a book 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.789
 if you want you can not read me 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.830
 it seems that it’s not necessarily in 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.990
 in this case, but one way or another 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.539
 react adequately to what happens 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.210
 life on the screen because some 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.580
 culture should be watching movies 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.620
 it seems to me developed from a person to that 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.720
 the age who sat there behind me and 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.570
 eating for an hour laughed over every fifth 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.639
 moment of the film in general will not 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.130
 condemn other people don't do that either 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.750
 very good and i hope you like it 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.039
 the video is very messy I'm in now 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.430
