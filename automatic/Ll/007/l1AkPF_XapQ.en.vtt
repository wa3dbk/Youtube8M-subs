00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 the other tuto martes I am leonardo 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.360
 pérez grandson and today we are going to draw a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.730
 ring we start tracing an oval with 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.730
 loose movements from the shoulder 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.050
 we draw the shape and width that goes to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.050
 to have 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.320
 I'm using a pen with a 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.989
 Medium hardness lace with hb on a 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.230
 paper that is not totally white but 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.149
 a little grayish the complete list of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 materials is in the information under 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.570
 the video 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.950
 this ring is going to have a heart 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.890
 We correct the circumference because 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.559
 from this angle you should see a little 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.760
 less rounded 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.820
 we begin to shade 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 and to put some reflections 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.229
 if it was being a drawing as to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.840
 product design could leave all 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.890
 the original lines behind but as 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 I want something more realistic 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 it's a silver ring so it must 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.730
 have very clear contrasting reflections 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.110
 and very dark 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.960
 so a little more the way 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 and we continue with the reflexes and with the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.999
 shading 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.399
 I do not usually talk about the 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.159
 adventures that sometimes happened to 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.469
 be able to do the tutorials but today you 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.789
 I will comment 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.209
 recently they have given something busy to 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.990
 vary in these last days I arrived from 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:52.420
 Moscow to Kiev and then tie with two 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.819
 Ukrainian cities commission two 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.219

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.349

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.289

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.390

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.969
 London and the airport directly 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.750
 I took a bus to go to the city of 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.970
 peace the next morning in bar grabé 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.030
 this drawing supported on a small 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.459
 wall and in the afternoon I had a visit to the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.590

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.200
 I went back to London to take care of some 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.660
 commitments and then I took another plane 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.359

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.379
 by the way in parentheses to the ring you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.200
 I give some reflections with pastel pencil 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.970
 white and having arrived late in the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.100
 night I'm recording the sound to see 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.410
