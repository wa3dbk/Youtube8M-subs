00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.589
 unfortunately, the internet is the third time 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.520
 because it friday night there after we all 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.410
 home and not really anymore 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.160
 we can talk 50 already 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.750
 seen games 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.160
 you can see some of them today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 for example, have fun with it 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 today I had the luck for me, even 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.779
 times by 150 fans and pain watching 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 to be allowed 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 unfortunately god is not really much new 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 that's why mostly the gamescom 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.859
 demo synonymous already on the preview 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.840
 event was shown so one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.510
 alternative approach to the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.940
 mission from the e3 where you have seen 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 like the horse of politics on command 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 Can buy and that authors on it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 slip or that the ki itself 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 After the missions has improved to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.719
 example he had in the e3 mission 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 always with headshots the opponents 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.289
 switched off and in these games 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 The Commission stops in the same place 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.920
 they then held helmets 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.930
 worn because they have learned the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 ks so i learned that i have a new one 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 that has been really cool that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.129
 one in the multiplayer 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.199
 there are multiplayer in metal gear solid 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 5 and also a different form than that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.550
 passive members online but it 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 in this case , the mummy bases the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.159
 you have already seen him basen 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.080
 where you then stop his first things in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.450
 Chain one can build with time and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000
 other players can use this base besides 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 who are based in and try yours that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 steal equipment again 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.500
 So the things the effectiveness recovers 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 can be stolen then online 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.619
 do not know what can make could be a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 a little frustrating but only 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.369
 displayed as a foreign malawi 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 has visited and then to the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.549
 defense, has sneaked past long 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.259
 you can build it yourself 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 so a little bit almost dungeon keeper 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.530
 moderately that's just a trap on fist 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.920
 and another splitter a race 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.079
 could 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 and then he has sometime from 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.520
 other players have discovered them completely 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 short pvp battle implied then was 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.700
 the demo also over that I find very 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.439
 very promising if you yourself 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 so can build his own plant 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.939
 then oh my god I'll just notice 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 somehow collected how to do that in dark 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.640
 would make souls 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.110
 or somebody is going to work on it me 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 currently needs to head back professional 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.479
 may war back quickly and ballast 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 then on the other player 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.320
 I have an extremely high potential for this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.149
 I 'm really looking forward to it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 everytime I see more on the game 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.469
 a whole new level of features 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.180
 which 105 I really only want 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.470
 finally have a release date per 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.360
 Video 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.700
 be a goal for the first time and do so 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:18.540
 thank you made further good both are 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 both cool i found myself at microsoft 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.570
 fable legions looked at the latest 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.240
 fable part of this time in one 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.180
 multiplayer direction one goes gambling four 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.420
 player against you in such a way 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.340
 new boss mode because it is one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 a bit like i wolf just that here 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.630
 a player who is the villain, so to speak 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.330
 he plays a lot like dungeon keeper 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.160
 small npc horden controlled and the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.020
 let go of the other four players 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.030
 can and these four players are the team 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.080
 Together against this one boss opponent 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.510
 have to play 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.370
 they have very different classes four 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.440
 they showed us that, but there are 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.630
 then in the final game supposedly up to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.160
 20 if that is really true then that 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.540
 we have to look in any case 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.940
 belonged to the four classes so what 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 classic as well as inside archer or 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.209
 Assassin or a totally crazy one 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.459
 Magician in the so a bit complete 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.870
 In the head is at the presentation has us 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.540
 developed said that stands so short 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.070
 to be a villain yourself and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 I played a healer myself 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.480
 it looks a bit like this one 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.860
 typical like these doctors house 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.269
 creed assassin's two that you know yes 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.150
 He says this beak masks 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.190
 bit out and that could be from the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.989
 adversarial about such a ray of life 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.610
 suck out what in turn with him 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.870
 one is filtered to the other 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.260
 heal and that was not so easy 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.670
 So you can already many opponents of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.500
 hostile players towards us and man 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.209
 really had to work with it 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.090
 surviving was of course tempted 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.070
 he imprisoning their own people 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.110
 can then fences in level or 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.489
 can make boot lattice monster to 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.019
 to build different places 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.400
 and then you have to monster all in one 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.200
 make flatten around to the next 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.489
 area to come and then there is the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.410
 enemy players again 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.610
 any fall and that prepared 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.820
 is pretty cool 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.170
 if that would be really good now 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.640
 that can be really great 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.280
 do not say I can only say that it 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.600
 in this short ten minutes demo the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.290
 we could really play fun 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.020
 has made 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.640
 this typical 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.130
 or role-playing like 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.200
 cooperation between the one with stelara 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.209
 and getting married and knowing that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.250
 the enemies come to you 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.900
 nice of an enemy player 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.240
 were placed precisely 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.520
 if that gives enough possibilities then 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.780
 really to entertain on a permanent basis 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.760
 and to be varied 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.850
 We'll just watch it if it's 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.140
 outside where to the north team tomorrow tumor 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.390
 but since I have done I have my 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.860
 shadow of motto looked at and I have to 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.030
 quite honestly say that as announced 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.890
 was the thing 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.420
 rich I left it rather cold 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.810
 because that was a bit too much for me 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.910
 after some uninspired implementation of the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.140
 Assassin's creed formula from these 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.790
 impression i can i have now 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.890
 actually revise 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.320
 First of all, the fighting system is what I am 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.940
 so from 40 different skills 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.080
 which is divided into 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.150
 He rangers and rascals to the batman 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.550
 arkham franchise oriented that is 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.810
 you have this free flow system for me 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.990
 personally just like it better and 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.120
 Secondly, this system is where you are 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.790
 big generals on the battlefield 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.110
 you meet gradually 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.880
 that must be a lot better than me 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.640
 thought because it is motivating you 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.830
 late in the open world in the near 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.420
 Bordeaux, so to speak, always the new ones 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.010
 opponent gets more information 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.590
 Waiting for the right moment from where you 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.150
 access fights then that's pretty 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.590
 dynamic and pretty epic too 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.000
 staged there likes to come sometimes 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.520
 spontaneously there comes just a little bit 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.170
 replenishment of orks you have to leave again 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.840
 race must use his skills 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.640
 to bring down the general and 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.950
 All in all, this is called a system 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.630
 which by the way is not finite means that is 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.880
 you will never somehow the whole 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.870
 opponents on this basis map somehow 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.320
 have defeated but always come 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.150
 new after very motivating as I think 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.590
 a game that did not make me so graphic 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.960
 I have to be honest 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.730
 say there is nothing for moderately right now 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.780
 really comparable so the 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.980
 comparable title to assassin's 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.390
 creed see there's a little bit better 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.890
 from me a bit too detailarm 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.900
 and the style has not me either 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.640
 otherwise I am 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.630
 but actually positively surprised by 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.850
 Chatter on fashion, I'm on it 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.780
 I will let play the fair 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.210
 the whole world 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.160
 so much for it 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.930
 I have drive today join me 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.889
 sony is still looking at playing there 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.199
 I was a bit skeptical so far 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.030
 so that for a cool racing games 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.990
 have no real character from today 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.250
 I also see a little bit more 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.720
 can and i can tell you this 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.220
 one-year wait since then 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.870
 original release date has changed 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.849
 really really worth it 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.740
 the game looks incredible output 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.470
 city ​​really a generation leap 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.729
 between 25 and 38 clarke especially with 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.770
 the weather effects only after 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.180
 By the way , we became too patched 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.889
 worn by other journalists me 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.380
 think it just makes it that way 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.030
 made that snow effects at night 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.710
 look incredibly good from one of the 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.270
 the most beautiful graphics experience that way 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.310
 you've seen it for a moment 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.020
 approached and there were the 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.270
 fascination is not quite so kaster though 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.310
 the driving feeling is nice to controls 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.960
 very good but nothing really 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.639
 simulation or kate worshiped and 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.410
 mean things a bit crass 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.060
 is going on nonetheless for 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.430
 Racing fans also value graphics 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.169
 put that is an absolute hammer 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.729
 Big Bird said the online modes for 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.099
 singleplayer probably not like that 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.139
 very interesting but for online fans 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:17.830
 or racing fans and graphic fans and 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:23.040
 Sony fans an incredible 1 packages 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:25.110
 great works well 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.060

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.860

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.860
 right there somewhere right here 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.630
 cool interview with the makers of 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.790
 Among other things you will learn call of duty 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.470

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.750
