00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.250
 hello yes I think that of the themes the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.560
 wind the theme of i'm your brain tour and it's 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 of the most affordable to touch and to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.180
 sing above all else you'll see 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.369
 learn it and you play it alone with your 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.349
 colleagues and you talk as it turns out something very 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.570
 well let's go there I'll make a 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.789
 zoom and I explain the subject 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.970
 the theme consists of two parts verses and 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.180
 refrains we go with the verses in the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.550
 verses we do the following brief 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.400
 you start putting an older one like this here 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.040
 in the 7th fret and plan out with your finger 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.190
 3 because from time to time and if you can 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.400
 let's put the little finger the note look 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 back had second string and we go back to 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.570
 lift up 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 now 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:16.550
 it's worth the rhythm we make a triplet down 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 in a 23 there ripped up a bit the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.860
 barb and five times down 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 with the note of my sixth loose string 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.120
 I always work except in the triplet s 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 after the first blow down 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.710
 slowly and now putting the little finger of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.310
 once in a while as Azerbaijan made in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310
 the direct 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.050
 on that side the atypical and from time to time 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.429
 when instead of with the little finger in 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.370
 place of the fourth what we do is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.459
 step on the sixth fret 9 of the second 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.459
 rope that is like a blues vale 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.200
 that's why the theme is already based on blues 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.460
 really like initial millions of 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
 subjects but they go 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.070
 let's suffer here the same 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.570
 we play the mini je game but 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.570
 stepping on the sixth with a blues 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.240
 why 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 yes 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.550
 because those are the verses have nothing 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.920
 more let's touch it slowly 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.020
 with me slowly 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.080
 come on let's go there try to sing like that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.350
 a little to make things easier for the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.350
 topic 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.030
 6 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.410
 now 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.940
 the day 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.790
 is already and now we are going to the refrain that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.580
 it's super simple, good if you want before 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.920
 of the chorus several measures of a 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.360
 something like something like that because this does not 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.980
 is transcribed nowhere to do 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.780
 something like when you're in the end 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.780
 That place here ends here 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.490
 and chorus 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.870
 me here on the fret 2 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.870
 third rope 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.260
 according to three fingers 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.970
 first sixth fret rope and we started 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.970
 the very simple chorus like that 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.760
 ah 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.199
 ah 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.110
 that is more 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.349
 I come back like this 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.610
 and now change do sharp minor 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.610
 F sharp 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:22.409
 yes but minor 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.279
 Oh 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.279
 do not 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.280
 and here 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.900
 want to break 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.450
 and just touch me slowly 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450
 chorus 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.870
 and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.020
 Well that 's all I hope you have fun 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.050
 a lot with this song sung with your 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.880
 colleagues with your friend or your dog that 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.880
 He's very cool and you talk like salt
