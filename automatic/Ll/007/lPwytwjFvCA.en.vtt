00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.770 
game was saving that's why we're doing
it<00:04:43.550> sorry<00:04:43.850> about<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.060> ok<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:46.630> let's<00:04:47.630> see<00:04:47.750> how

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
it sorry about that ok so let's see how

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.070 
it sorry about that ok so let's see how
it<00:04:47.840> looks<00:04:47.990> now<00:04:48.280> about<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.430> same<00:04:49.580> thing<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
it looks now about the same thing so you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.750 
it looks now about the same thing so you
know<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.560> said<00:04:51.950> you<00:04:52.040> can<00:04:52.190> run<00:04:52.340> some<00:04:52.490> games

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
know I said you can run some games

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.620 
know I said you can run some games
without<00:04:53.060> own<00:04:53.950> AC<00:04:54.950> adapter<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:56.060> guess<00:04:56.330> games

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
without own AC adapter but I guess games

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.870 
without own AC adapter but I guess games
with<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.230> magnitude<00:04:57.740> should<00:04:57.800> not<00:04:58.280> be<00:04:58.550> rand

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
with this magnitude should not be rand

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.560 
with this magnitude should not be rand
without<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.780> AC<00:04:59.990> adapter<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:02.000> emulators

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
without the AC adapter on the emulators

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.990 
without the AC adapter on the emulators
yeah<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.960> can<00:05:03.080> be<00:05:03.110> ran<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:03.770> yeah<00:05:04.460> they<00:05:04.640> were

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
yeah it can be ran but yeah they were

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.340 
yeah it can be ran but yeah they were
perfect<00:05:05.480> without<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.810> power<00:05:05.960> which<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:06.260> know

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
perfect without the power which you know

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.380 
perfect without the power which you know
they<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> better<00:05:06.890> performance<00:05:07.460> but

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
they have a better performance but

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.790 
they have a better performance but
that's<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.690> for<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.870> dopamine<00:05:09.230> guy<00:05:09.410> cry

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
that's it for the dopamine guy cry

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.830 
that's it for the dopamine guy cry
