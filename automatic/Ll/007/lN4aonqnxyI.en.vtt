example<00:04:47.000> was<00:04:47.090> one<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.390> reasons<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.720> picked

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
example was one of the reasons I picked

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.300 
example was one of the reasons I picked
this<00:04:48.110> because<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.800> single<00:04:49.130> player<00:04:49.280> game

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
this because it is a single player game

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.700 
this because it is a single player game
and<00:04:49.910> it's<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.419> game<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.780> i<00:04:51.050> feel<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:51.320> should

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
and it's a game I i feel that should

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.680 
and it's a game I i feel that should
never<00:04:51.950> venture<00:04:52.580> into<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.820> multiplayer<00:04:53.360> realm

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
never venture into the multiplayer realm

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.330 
never venture into the multiplayer realm
not<00:04:54.290> because<00:04:54.590> i<00:04:54.620> don't<00:04:54.860> want<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:55.070> feel<00:04:55.190> like

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
not because i don't want to feel like

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.650 
not because i don't want to feel like
it's<00:04:55.520> an<00:04:55.610> elitist<00:04:55.880> or<00:04:56.030> anything<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.419> i<00:04:56.510> feel

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
it's an elitist or anything but i feel

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.880 
it's an elitist or anything but i feel
like<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.900> would<00:04:57.020> take<00:04:57.200> away<00:04:57.470> from<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
like it would take away from the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.700 
like it would take away from the
single-player<00:04:58.430> aspects<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.410> like<00:05:00.410> games

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
single-player aspects of it like games

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.620 
single-player aspects of it like games
like<00:05:00.919> Call<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.130> Duty<00:05:01.430> for<00:05:01.610> example<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.240> don't

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
like Call of Duty for example I don't

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.909 
like Call of Duty for example I don't
