it actually took right about 20 minutes

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.640 
it actually took right about 20 minutes
to<00:04:16.489> get<00:04:16.610> this<00:04:16.790> shot<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.840> pig<00:04:18.110> was<00:04:18.260> looking<00:04:18.560> at

to get this shot the pig was looking at
him<00:04:18.769> most<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.400> time

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.190 

that<00:04:42.590> was<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> bit<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:43.040> tricky<00:04:43.640> one<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:43.820> think

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
that was a bit of a tricky one I think

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.560 
that was a bit of a tricky one I think
the<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> don't<00:04:46.760> know<00:04:46.820> about<00:04:46.910> half<00:04:47.180> way<00:04:47.390> and

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
the that I don't know about half way and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.990 
the that I don't know about half way and
into<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.870> stork<00:04:48.170> I<00:04:48.490> reckon<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.580> pig<00:04:49.760> was<00:04:49.880> on

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
into the stork I reckon the pig was on

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.780 
into the stork I reckon the pig was on
deer<00:04:50.150> rod<00:04:50.710> he<00:04:51.710> was<00:04:51.830> onto<00:04:51.980> me<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> rock<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.610> then

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
deer rod he was onto me a rock and then

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.240 
deer rod he was onto me a rock and then
yeah<00:04:52.970> we<00:04:53.120> saw<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.360> draw<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.020> he<00:04:54.920> had<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.130> let

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
yeah we saw you draw and he had to let

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.190 
yeah we saw you draw and he had to let
down<00:04:55.460> because<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.760> never<00:04:55.940> shot<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.270> yeah<00:04:56.900> well

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
down because you never shot a yeah well

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.870 
down because you never shot a yeah well
I<00:04:57.410> thought<00:04:57.770> I'd<00:04:57.980> probably<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.730> only

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
I thought I'd probably the only

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.150 
I thought I'd probably the only
opportunity<00:04:58.970> I'd<00:04:59.480> have<00:04:59.660> was<00:04:59.870> if<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.860> got<00:05:01.040> in

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
opportunity I'd have was if I got in

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.490 
opportunity I'd have was if I got in
closer<00:05:01.430> yeah<00:05:02.240> because<00:05:02.690> he<00:05:02.930> was<00:05:03.050> trying<00:05:03.200> onto

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
closer yeah because he was trying onto

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.780 
closer yeah because he was trying onto
me<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:04.880> shot<00:05:05.390> wasn't<00:05:05.600> an<00:05:05.810> option<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.290> here<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.800> am

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
me a shot wasn't an option so here I am

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.790 
me a shot wasn't an option so here I am
yeah<00:05:08.510> just<00:05:08.750> waited<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.290> little<00:05:09.470> bit<00:05:09.590> and

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
yeah just waited for a little bit and

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.500 
yeah just waited for a little bit and
just<00:05:09.830> every<00:05:10.190> time<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.550> got<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:10.790> got<00:05:11.270> his<00:05:11.390> head

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
just every time you got to got his head

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.760 
just every time you got to got his head
on<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.720> water<00:05:11.930> wearing<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.260> little<00:05:12.440> bit<00:05:12.560> closer

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
on the water wearing a little bit closer

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.000 
on the water wearing a little bit closer
and<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.160> got<00:05:13.340> me<00:05:13.370> into<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:14.150> spot<00:05:14.480> where<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:15.010> was

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
and that got me into a spot where I was

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.730 
and that got me into a spot where I was
20<00:05:16.250> metres<00:05:16.520> off<00:05:16.640> him<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:16.970> reckon<00:05:17.510> I

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
20 metres off him and I reckon I

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.640 
20 metres off him and I reckon I
could've<00:05:18.740> taken<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.070> shot<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> did<00:05:19.700> yeah

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
could've taken the shot so I did yeah

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.990 
could've taken the shot so I did yeah
and<00:05:21.650> because<00:05:21.830> he<00:05:22.070> was<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.340> deep<00:05:22.580> in<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.820> water

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
and because he was so deep in the water

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.750 
and because he was so deep in the water
I<00:05:23.090> had<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.330> take<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.510> front<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:23.870> shot<00:05:24.760> Reddy's

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
I had to take a front on shot Reddy's

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.460 
I had to take a front on shot Reddy's
head<00:05:25.970> up<00:05:26.120> in<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.300> air<00:05:26.420> he<00:05:26.720> was<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:26.990> his<00:05:27.110> looking

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
head up in the air he was on his looking

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.540 
head up in the air he was on his looking

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
at you every time he had his head up

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.180

here yeah he probably run about a
hundred<00:05:47.240> yards<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:47.540> he<00:05:47.630> fell<00:05:47.810> over<00:05:47.900> you<00:05:48.260> know

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350

would have said 80 meters but yeah it
wasn't<00:05:50.420> very<00:05:50.570> far<00:05:50.810> it's<00:05:51.710> awesome<00:05:52.040> out<00:05:52.160> yeah

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
it's not a bad shot but you've got to be

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.170 
it's not a bad shot but you've got to be
pinpoint<00:05:54.920> accurate<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:55.400> know<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:55.970> works

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
pinpoint accurate you know and it works

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.630 
pinpoint accurate you know and it works
really<00:05:56.390> well<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:57.500> I<00:05:57.620> was<00:05:57.650> lucky<00:05:57.890> enough<00:05:58.040> for

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
really well and I was lucky enough for

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.250 
really well and I was lucky enough for
me<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.120> mouthful<00:05:59.420> of<00:05:59.510> food<00:05:59.570> that<00:05:59.870> he<00:05:59.990> set<00:06:00.140> up

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
me and a mouthful of food that he set up

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.170 
me and a mouthful of food that he set up
in<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.470> air<00:06:00.590> yeah<00:06:01.370> I<00:06:01.400> opened<00:06:01.700> up<00:06:01.760> the<00:06:01.910> angle

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
in the air yeah I opened up the angle

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.180 
in the air yeah I opened up the angle
for<00:06:02.360> me<00:06:02.480> yeah<00:06:02.870> otherwise<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.710> would<00:06:03.950> have<00:06:03.980> just

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
for me yeah otherwise I would have just

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.530 
for me yeah otherwise I would have just
had<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.400> let<00:06:04.520> down<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.850> next<00:06:05.060> time<00:06:05.180> he<00:06:05.270> put<00:06:05.450> his

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
had to let down the next time he put his

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.520 
had to let down the next time he put his
head<00:06:05.630> on<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.870> water<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:06.200> waited<00:06:06.410> for<00:06:06.440> a

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
head on the water and waited for a

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.770 
head on the water and waited for a
broadside<00:06:06.860> shot<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.600> sorted<00:06:08.600> him<00:06:08.660> out

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
broadside shot so that sorted him out

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.960 
broadside shot so that sorted him out
but<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.170> was<00:06:09.500> lucky<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.040> get<00:06:10.220> that<00:06:10.370> opportunity

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970
