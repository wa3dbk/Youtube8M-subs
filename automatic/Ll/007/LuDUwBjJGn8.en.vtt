Oracle checkpoint of the vault of glass

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.479 
Oracle checkpoint of the vault of glass
raid<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.540> estimated<00:00:28.079> to<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.559> a<00:00:29.130> drop

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
raid and it is estimated to have a drop

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.229 
raid and it is estimated to have a drop
percentage<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.270> about<00:00:30.840> 5%<00:00:31.970> honestly<00:00:32.970> that

percentage of about 5% honestly that
seems<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.720> little<00:00:33.750> bit<00:00:34.110> too<00:00:34.530> high<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.040> my

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
seems a little bit too high in my

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
seems a little bit too high in my
opinion<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.300> I've<00:00:36.450> been<00:00:36.570> grinding<00:00:36.930> vault

at<00:01:54.120> a<00:01:54.950> 248<00:01:55.950> attack<00:01:56.340> value<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.510> little

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
at a 248 attack value that's a little

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.300 
at a 248 attack value that's a little
bit<00:01:57.870> weird<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.230> thought<00:01:58.380> after<00:01:58.860> house<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
bit weird I thought after house of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.150 
bit weird I thought after house of
wolves<00:01:59.640> everything<00:02:00.150> drops<00:02:00.510> at<00:02:00.830> 300<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.040> then

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
wolves everything drops at 300 and then

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.490 
wolves everything drops at 300 and then
obviously<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.970> can<00:02:03.000> ascend<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.690> or<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.380> can

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
obviously you can ascend it or you can

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
obviously you can ascend it or you can
just<00:02:04.680> upgrade<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.220> 365<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> was

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
just upgrade it to 365 so that was

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.559 
just upgrade it to 365 so that was
really<00:02:07.170> weird<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.920> check<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.849> sick<00:02:09.300> ass

fusion<00:02:18.599> rifle<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.049> my<00:02:19.590> opinion<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.370> has<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.489> lot

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
fusion rifle in my opinion and has a lot

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.670 
fusion rifle in my opinion and has a lot
of<00:02:20.969> lights<00:02:21.269> all

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

of lights all
over<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.219> gives<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.640> vexed<00:02:23.359> vibe

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689

pretty<00:02:34.189> much<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:35.060> same<00:02:35.980> follows<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.099> same

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
pretty much the same follows the same

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.309

up and obviously a burst of fusion comes
out<00:02:43.549> very<00:02:43.939> standard<00:02:44.599> stuff<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.409> really<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
out very standard stuff but really the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.039 
out very standard stuff but really the
main<00:02:46.129> difference<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.909> just<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.510> way<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.930> it

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
main difference is just the way that it

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.770 
main difference is just the way that it
