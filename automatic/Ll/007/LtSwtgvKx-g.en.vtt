really like the ending and I didn't like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.510 
really like the ending and I didn't like
the<00:00:30.599> fact<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.660> Gundam<00:00:33.950> was<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the fact that the Gundam was kind of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
the fact that the Gundam was kind of
destroyed<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.440> didn't<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> idea<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
destroyed and didn't like the idea of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.450 
destroyed and didn't like the idea of
the<00:00:38.489> Gundam<00:00:39.350> being<00:00:40.350> portrayed<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:42.059> enemy

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460

ribbons and I'm like well it wasn't

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.069 
ribbons and I'm like well it wasn't
always<00:00:55.280> an<00:00:56.280> enemy<00:00:56.850> Gundam<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.960> know

always an enemy Gundam it was you know

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.189 
always an enemy Gundam it was you know
it<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> good<00:00:58.859> guy<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.070> should<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> had<00:00:59.730> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
it was a good guy it should have had a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.270 
it was a good guy it should have had a
good<00:01:01.199> guy<00:01:01.410> pilot<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:03.470> anyway<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.070> was

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
good guy pilot but anyway so I was

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.590 
good guy pilot but anyway so I was
thinking<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.330> well

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
thinking about that and I was like well

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
thinking about that and I was like well
you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> old<00:01:08.220> Gundam<00:01:08.580> deserves

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you know I think the old Gundam deserves

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
you know I think the old Gundam deserves
to<00:01:09.240> he<00:01:09.840> deserve<00:01:10.590> something<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> little<00:01:11.369> bit

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to he deserve something a little bit

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.649 
to he deserve something a little bit
better<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.420> decided<00:01:12.990> decided<00:01:14.060> decided<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
better so I decided decided decided to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.070 
better so I decided decided decided to
make<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> custom<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:19.189> that<00:01:20.189> custom<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
make a custom and that custom is this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.160 
make a custom and that custom is this
right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.979> back<00:01:26.100> out

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
right here and this is going back out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.039 
right here and this is going back out
this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.409> custom<00:01:29.060> Gundam<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:33.049> guess

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this is my custom Gundam and I guess

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.910 
this is my custom Gundam and I guess
what<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:34.500> done<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.009> I've<00:01:35.600> I've<00:01:36.600> done<00:01:37.140> him<00:01:37.380> up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
straight here and out they go and for

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.500 
straight here and out they go and for
some<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.110> might<00:02:15.710> seem<00:02:18.820> familiar<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
some of you they might seem familiar and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.580 
some of you they might seem familiar and
that's<00:02:20.750> because<00:02:21.260> these<00:02:21.530> are<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:23.590> don't

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
that's because these are the I don't

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.170 
that's because these are the I don't
know<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.920> would<00:02:25.040> call<00:02:25.340> them<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.970> guess

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
know what you would call them I guess

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.540 
know what you would call them I guess
you<00:02:26.360> could<00:02:26.510> call<00:02:26.720> them<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.320> arm<00:02:27.680> weapons<00:02:28.100> or

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
you could call them the arm weapons or

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.660 
you could call them the arm weapons or
the<00:02:28.670> shoulder<00:02:29.090> weapons<00:02:29.710> from<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:31.280> ello

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
the shoulder weapons from the ello

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.010 
the shoulder weapons from the ello
booster<00:02:33.490> which<00:02:34.490> was<00:02:34.700> originally<00:02:34.970> from<00:02:35.780> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
booster which was originally from I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.690 
booster which was originally from I
believe<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.560> was<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.740> manga<00:02:37.100> series<00:02:37.280> called

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
believe it was a manga series called

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.880 
believe it was a manga series called
Gundam<00:02:38.150> unit<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.600> don't<00:02:38.750> think<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.140> pretty

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
Gundam unit I don't think of it pretty

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.650 
Gundam unit I don't think of it pretty
sure<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.160> never<00:02:40.310> made<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> anime<00:02:41.210> out<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.510> it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
sure they never made a anime out of it

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.000 
sure they never made a anime out of it
but<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.520> believe<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.670> was<00:02:43.790> just<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.120> comic<00:02:44.540> or<00:02:45.410> a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
but I believe it was just a comic or a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.160 
but I believe it was just a comic or a
manga<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:50.360> thought<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.720> two<00:02:50.870> went

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
manga but I really thought the two went

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.860 
manga but I really thought the two went
together<00:02:51.350> well<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.880> decided<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.540> make

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
together well and so I decided to make

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.050 
together well and so I decided to make
some<00:02:54.080> modifications<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.950> my<00:02:55.220> old<00:02:55.430> Gundam<00:02:55.880> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
some modifications to my old Gundam and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.590 
some modifications to my old Gundam and
to<00:02:56.900> change<00:02:57.740> them<00:02:57.950> into<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.870> now<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:01.600> also

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
back skirts and I'll spin that around so

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.330 
back skirts and I'll spin that around so
you<00:03:23.209> can<00:03:23.420> see<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.670> back<00:03:25.940> skirts<00:03:27.070> from<00:03:28.070> the

you can see it the back skirts from the
a<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:31.340> booster<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:33.440> there

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530 

sideskirts<00:03:39.650> with<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> same<00:03:40.280> front<00:03:41.209> stairs

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
sideskirts with the same front stairs

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.640 
sideskirts with the same front stairs
have<00:03:41.690> been<00:03:41.720> changed

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.369 

and<00:03:49.549> then<00:03:49.760> there's<00:03:50.090> obviously<00:03:50.900> there's<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
and then there's obviously there's the

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.100 
and then there's obviously there's the
on<00:03:51.560> pods<00:03:52.090> which<00:03:53.090> basically<00:03:55.209> on<00:03:56.209> all<00:03:56.239> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
on pods which basically on all the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.009 
on pods which basically on all the
Gundam<00:03:57.440> unit<00:03:57.769> kits<00:03:58.150> there's<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.299> extra

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
Gundam unit kits there's a extra

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.740 
Gundam unit kits there's a extra
shoulder<00:04:00.530> piece<00:04:00.799> that<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.370> larger<00:04:02.360> shoulder

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
shoulder piece that this larger shoulder

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.259 
shoulder piece that this larger shoulder
piece<00:04:03.340> mounts<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:09.370> it's<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.730> edit<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
piece mounts to and it's just edit the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.690 
piece mounts to and it's just edit the
whole<00:04:11.569> unit<00:04:12.019> just<00:04:12.200> kind<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.620> slides<00:04:13.010> down<00:04:13.459> on

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
whole unit just kind of slides down on

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.490 
whole unit just kind of slides down on
top<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.629> that<00:04:14.750> locks<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.260> into<00:04:15.409> place

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
top of that and that locks it into place

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.920 
top of that and that locks it into place
so<00:04:16.010> basically<00:04:16.790> what<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.030> did<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.600> took

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
so basically what I did is I just took

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.170 
so basically what I did is I just took
that<00:04:17.989> piece<00:04:18.380> modified<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.340> glued<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.850> to<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
that piece modified it glued it to the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.629 
that piece modified it glued it to the
old<00:04:20.329> Gundam<00:04:20.750> shoulder<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:22.130> allowed<00:04:22.430> me

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
old Gundam shoulder and that allowed me

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.950 
old Gundam shoulder and that allowed me
to<00:04:22.669> mount<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.990> arm<00:04:24.500> weapons<00:04:24.949> on<00:04:25.130> here<00:04:25.460> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
to mount the arm weapons on here and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.900 
to mount the arm weapons on here and
there's<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.020> couple<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.440> different<00:04:27.770> versions<00:04:28.070> a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
there's a couple of different versions a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.240 
there's a couple of different versions a
couple<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.840> different<00:04:30.169> gun<00:04:30.590> nubs<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:30.949> the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
couple of different gun nubs in the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.779 
couple of different gun nubs in the
Gundam<00:04:31.729> unit<00:04:32.030> series<00:04:32.449> so<00:04:33.410> theoretically<00:04:33.789> you

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
Gundam unit series so theoretically you

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.879 
Gundam unit series so theoretically you
could<00:04:34.940> swap<00:04:35.300> shoulders<00:04:35.990> out<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.440> could<00:04:36.620> you

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
could swap shoulders out you could you

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.590 
could swap shoulders out you could you
know<00:04:37.010> if<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.250> had<00:04:37.550> all<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.970> kits<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.449> could

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
know if you had all the kits you could

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.800 
know if you had all the kits you could
just<00:04:38.810> swap<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.440> shoulder<00:04:39.800> weapons<00:04:40.160> out<00:04:40.370> and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
just swap the shoulder weapons out and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.960 
just swap the shoulder weapons out and
to<00:04:41.810> make<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.110> old<00:04:42.289> Gundam<00:04:42.650> really<00:04:42.979> versatile

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
to make the old Gundam really versatile

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.590 
to make the old Gundam really versatile
but<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.470> won't<00:04:45.470> be<00:04:45.590> doing<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:45.889> I'm<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:46.460> gonna

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
but I won't be doing that I'm just gonna

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.170 
but I won't be doing that I'm just gonna

how it turned out just did some some

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.860 
how it turned out just did some some
minor<00:04:57.620> detail<00:04:58.220> painting<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.820> painted<00:04:59.450> all<00:04:59.599> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
minor detail painting I painted all the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.629 
minor detail painting I painted all the
pieces<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.470> inside<00:05:00.590> silver<00:05:03.490> tried<00:05:04.490> to

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
pieces on the inside silver tried to

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.779 
pieces on the inside silver tried to
replicate<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:06.400> GN<00:05:07.840> weapons<00:05:09.580> typical<00:05:10.580> to

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
replicate the GN weapons typical to

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.810 
replicate the GN weapons typical to
Gundam<00:05:11.419> double<00:05:11.720> loads<00:05:12.520> silver<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.700> then

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
Gundam double loads silver and then

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.670 
Gundam double loads silver and then
painted<00:05:14.240> with<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.599> Tamiya<00:05:15.020> clear<00:05:15.380> green

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
painted with the Tamiya clear green

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.240 
painted with the Tamiya clear green
underneath

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
underneath

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.779 
underneath
I<00:05:16.520> used<00:05:17.389> Tamiya<00:05:18.110> Italian<00:05:18.770> red<00:05:19.039> for<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> all

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
I used Tamiya Italian red for the all

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.150 
I used Tamiya Italian red for the all
the<00:05:20.000> red<00:05:20.180> parts<00:05:20.599> because<00:05:21.229> I<00:05:21.349> just<00:05:21.770> really<00:05:22.010> like

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
the red parts because I just really like

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.129 
the red parts because I just really like
the<00:05:22.340> color<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.789> a<00:05:22.910> nice<00:05:23.060> vibrant<00:05:23.690> bright

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
the color it's a nice vibrant bright

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.980 
the color it's a nice vibrant bright
color<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.910> regular<00:05:25.910> red<00:05:26.180> is<00:05:26.389> probably<00:05:26.630> a<00:05:26.840> little

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
color a regular red is probably a little

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.909 
color a regular red is probably a little
closer<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.780> normal<00:05:29.780> red<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.349> kinda<00:05:30.710> like

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
closer to a normal red but I kinda like

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.219 
closer to a normal red but I kinda like
I<00:05:31.190> always<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:31.789> the<00:05:31.940> Italian<00:05:32.419> red<00:05:32.630> color<00:05:32.900> so

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
I always like the Italian red color so

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.980 
I always like the Italian red color so
that's<00:05:33.440> what<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.680> went<00:05:33.889> with<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.510> he<00:05:35.510> still<00:05:35.780> has

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
that's what I went with and he still has

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.480 
that's what I went with and he still has
his<00:05:36.320> beam<00:05:37.250> saber<00:05:37.639> attached<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.479> back

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
his beam saber attached to the back

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.870 
his beam saber attached to the back
right<00:05:40.490> there<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.630> also<00:05:42.849> did<00:05:43.849> some

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
right there and I also did some

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.210 
right there and I also did some
detailing<00:05:44.630> on<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.840> GN<00:05:45.169> drive<00:05:45.500> gave<00:05:45.860> it<00:05:45.979> a<00:05:46.039> nice

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
detailing on the GN drive gave it a nice
