00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.280
 today we are going to make a chocolate ice cream 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.440
 in which we will put center 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.350
 fluid chocolate inside so that at 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.580
 open it in the center appear good with 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.559
 we have used an ice cream 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.080
 chocolate carte d'or and we have used 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.050
 also chocolate for value desserts 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.740
 pure chocolate the first thing to tell 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.150
 a trick to fix I bought the ice cream 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.650
 verify that it was okay because of course 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.779
 if it is already frozen, nothing is useful 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.060
 that I am going to tell you and once I saw that 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.879
 It was correct that it is soft 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.629
 I put in a bag of these to freeze 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.559
 which are the plastic ones and so I put it in 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.109
 the freezer 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.729
 in this way when we open it it continues 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.710
 soft 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.569
 that is, we get it to be better for 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.239
 use well we will also use some 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.640
 crystal bowls to these bowls I have 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.809
 put aluminum foil 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.850
 or silver paper as you want so that 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.290
 we can put side and then unmold 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 you can easily put it also 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.010
 plastic in what you want I prefer 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.560
 the silver because it seems to stay 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.560
 more grab well then now you see that 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.530
 our ice cream is not hard hard what 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.119
 we do is melt a little bit 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.430
 you pass melting because then if not 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.710
 then it's going to look bad then you have to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.930
 do it at a mid point neither liquid nor 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.030
 hard, well, what I do is put it 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.770
 in each of my goals, run two and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 spread on the walls so that in 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.450
 the center was a gap and the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.280
 walls are lined with the side I'm going 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.810
 little by little undoing I do not undo all 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.789
 the time because if I do not also stay 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.860
 very liquid and also what I do is a 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.660
 once I just filled each bowl what 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 I'm going into the freezer 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.140
 you should protect it is up good 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.970
 we will continue while we have 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.830
 all in the freezer so that it 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.740
 are a little harder we put a 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.420
 chocolate tablet with a little water 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 and we put it in the microwave also 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.100
 You can do the bain- marie as you wish 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.900
 we heat more need to warm up completely and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.000
 we go around that we are doing 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.300
 we are making the syrup from the center 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 one night if we are still hard for 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
 we continue to pour water once the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 chocolate we have poured water 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.789
 initially then it no longer spoils if 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.860
 we miss him more then let's leave him 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.770
 at a point that we want to appear 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.930
 then in our ice cream we are also going to 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.150
 heat chocolate this time without water 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.280
 because we are going to make the third texture 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.040
 and that texture the pure chocolate of 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.260
 desserts with which we are going to make some 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.120
 small circles we are going to make some caps 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.220
 are the ones that we will put in the part of 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.930
 down the ice cream and to do that 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.450
 statuette not something we have to put 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 it's on top of the foil in this 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.890
 I'm using oven paper 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.500
 with a little spoon 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.540
 doing circulitos you see we are going to do 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.150
 a few chocolate circles and then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.610
 We will put in the fridge and wait for 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.739
 that are hard I'm doing 6 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.690
 ice cream but I make more rounds in case 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.090
 Has any good breaks me the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.620
 We put in the fridge and meanwhile I 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.660
 I'm going to put to decorate marmalade 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.340
 raspberry and what I've done is put it 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.260
 a little in the microwave or heat it a 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.210
 little to bain- marie to make it more 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.330
 easy to remove the nuggets 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.130
 I'm warm now what I do is pass it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.260
 through a sieve and remove the seeds 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.990
 I will also be adding a bit of 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.310
 cookie for the side but you can use 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.980
 nuts or anything else to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.570
 put on top to be ice cream what 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.310
 we're going to do is place at the last 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.450
 then what I do is to be 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.430
 of the freezer 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.860
 If I have little hole do a little more 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.320
 of a hole filled with my chocolate 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.910
 liquid that eye has to be cold not 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.070
 It is worth hot peppers 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.990
 chocolate reptile and do not put it to 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.520
 the fridge that will stay hard to leave 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.370
 the room temperature until it is 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.290
 cool and I'm putting in the center 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.300
 this liquid chocolate 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.760
 once I do this what I do is 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.590
 pick up my chocolate disks and put them 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.750
 I tighten the lid so that when 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.730
 overturn do not drop the chocolate 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.610
 melted like this would stay 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.320
 stuck to the bottom side I put you all 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.550
 the discs that now I have nothing but 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.590
 unmold for that pulled from my stories 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.450
 You can also make molds 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.190
 cupcakes I take my plate I turn around already 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.750
 I know that I will not be perfect 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.660
 surface because the silver paper 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.910
 has in wrinkles but I put my 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.470
 raspberry jam and now you can 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.200
 garnish with raspberries or as I do not 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.250

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.360
