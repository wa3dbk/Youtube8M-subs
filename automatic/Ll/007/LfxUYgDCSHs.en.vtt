00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.970
 we are in the region of the five lakes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.250
 fuji 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.020
 right now we are fine 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.020
 and here to face 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 sea ​​of ​​trees 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.510
 this site is sadly famous for a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.720
 thing 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.590
 is where the Japanese come to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.570
 commit suicide 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.210
 The bad thing about this forest is that it 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.100
 you lose right away since we are not going to 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.760
 do a lot we go the way marked 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.950
 there is a way that we can not go 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.800
 we will go 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.910
 let's go a little when 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 suddenly how are we going 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.559
 if you search for information online 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.650
 to find things very very very 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.720
 unpleasant of this site 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.720
 so nothing, let's explore it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.710
 the forest was created more than a thousand years ago 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.830
 by the eruptions of Mount Fuji and it 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.890
 located at the foot of Mount Fuji to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.229
 its north face 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 It is between Mount Fuji and the lake 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 kawaguchi co 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.170
 here it seems that there is a lot of iron in 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.490
 soil 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.060
 then the compasses the gps if these 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 artifacts to guide us are not usually 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 work very well here as it says 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 boys who are cursed 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.390
 we are not rotating at the moment 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 nothing clear 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.439
 there are hundreds of writings 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.950
 that narrate how the forest is full of 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.950
 got damn 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.750
 and that the forest is basically 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.750
 charmed 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.710
 in the tremendous famines that there were 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.930
 Japan in the 19th century is said 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.650
 that families abandoned in this 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.650
 forest to the elderly 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.090
 they have become legends of the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.090
 forest spirits 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430
 i 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.690
 in 1966 or machu moto a Japanese writer 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.270
 write a book for a young woman who 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.870
 falls in love with the researcher who is 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.440
 investigating her husband 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.790
 and this creates me such a personal conflict 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.670
 who commits suicide 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.469
 since the publication of this book is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.870
 when more suicides are carried out in 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.760
 this forest 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.760
 there is also a book called the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.599
 Perfect suicide manual 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.599
 in which he says 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.970
 it is the ideal place to commit suicide 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.129
 this sign tells us not to go over 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.129
 Hereinafter 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.840
 and that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.120
 the forest is treacherous you can 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.139
 lose easily 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.370
 also from here you have the 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.590
 technicians of this forest 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.150
 you can find a lot of ribbons 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.950
 tied from tree to tree 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.030
 of those who did not have it very clear 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.220
 what they were going to do 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.120
 and you can find the exit because 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.120
 can find the body 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.320
 Following 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.810
 these ribbons 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.810
 you can find personal items 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.460
 medically 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.130
 we are not going to eat 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.750
 so here is our walk through 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.750
 the forest of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.890
 or here to face 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.890
 omar of some 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.320
 and if you want more information about 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.760
