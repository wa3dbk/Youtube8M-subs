00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the assisted opening which I believe is

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.479 
the assisted opening which I believe is
ball<00:00:44.610> bearing<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> Gerber<00:00:45.629> instant<00:00:46.170> it

one above this is the outrigger XL it
comes<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.409> designs<00:01:31.829> fine<00:01:32.400> edge<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
comes in two designs fine edge and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
comes in two designs fine edge and
serrated<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.840> decided<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> fine

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
serrated I decided to go for the fine

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
serrated I decided to go for the fine
edge<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.360> majority<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
edge on this one because the majority of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
edge on this one because the majority of
folding<00:01:37.170> blades<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.650> serrated<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> figure

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
folding blades are serrated and I figure

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.469 
folding blades are serrated and I figure
I<00:01:38.520> wanted<00:01:38.820> try<00:01:39.150> something<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> little

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
I wanted try something a little

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
I wanted try something a little
different<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.670> I'm<00:01:42.299> gonna<00:01:42.509> go

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
different so here we are I'm gonna go

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
different so here we are I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.229> tape<00:01:43.470> measure<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
ahead and use this tape measure here it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
ahead and use this tape measure here it
definitely<00:01:44.880> shows<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.380> inches

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
definitely shows that it is four inches

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
definitely shows that it is four inches
in<00:01:46.799> length<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.610> closed<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.930> open<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
in length when closed and when open it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
in length when closed and when open it
is<00:01:53.960> seven<00:01:54.960> inches<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.439> length<00:01:56.630> you've<00:01:57.630> given

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
is seven inches in length you've given

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340 
is seven inches in length you've given
it<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.290> three<00:01:58.590> inch<00:01:58.799> long<00:01:59.040> blade<00:01:59.659> compared<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it a three inch long blade compared to a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.139 
it a three inch long blade compared to a
typical<00:02:02.630> paper<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.990> pen

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
typical paper make pen

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.789 
typical paper make pen
that's<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.869> should<00:02:07.049> give<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> general

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that's that should give you a general

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.250 
that's that should give you a general
idea<00:02:08.660> facing<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> side

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
I'm a little worried about the internal

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.750 
I'm a little worried about the internal
design<00:03:52.569> of<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.889> can<00:03:54.190> see<00:03:54.340> if<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.519> could

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
design of this you can see if I could

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.379 
design of this you can see if I could
get<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.230> wish<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.349> had<00:03:56.500> some<00:03:56.650> light<00:03:56.889> for<00:03:57.129> that

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
get it wish I had some light for that

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.930 
get it wish I had some light for that
but<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.690> could<00:03:58.870> see<00:03:59.139> there's<00:03:59.949> a<00:04:00.040> little<00:04:00.340> notch

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
but you could see there's a little notch

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.949 
but you could see there's a little notch
right<00:04:00.970> there<00:04:01.389> and<00:04:02.430> were<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.790> put<00:04:05.040> where<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
right there and were the put where the

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.469 
right there and were the put where the
the<00:04:07.959> plunger<00:04:08.409> lock<00:04:08.590> which<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.340> right<00:04:09.549> here<00:04:09.579> it

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
the plunger lock which is right here it

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.960 
the plunger lock which is right here it
basically<00:04:11.260> when<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.590> blade<00:04:11.829> closes<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.639> let

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
basically when the blade closes in let

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.689 
basically when the blade closes in let
me<00:04:13.060> go<00:04:13.359> ahead<00:04:13.419> and<00:04:13.510> focus<00:04:13.810> on<00:04:14.139> that<00:04:14.639> there<00:04:15.639> we

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
me go ahead and focus on that there we

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:16.020 
me go ahead and focus on that there we
go

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
go

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.599 
go
when<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.570> blade<00:04:16.870> closes<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.909> it<00:04:18.909> locks<00:04:19.329> in

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
when the blade closes in it locks in

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.240 
when the blade closes in it locks in
into<00:04:21.609> place<00:04:21.880> like<00:04:22.090> so

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
into place like so

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.090 
into place like so
so<00:04:23.580> that's<00:04:24.420> supposed<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.020> keep<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.470> blade

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
so that's supposed to keep the blade

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100 
so that's supposed to keep the blade
from<00:04:26.280> folding<00:04:26.640> in<00:04:26.910> on<00:04:27.060> you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
from folding in on you
