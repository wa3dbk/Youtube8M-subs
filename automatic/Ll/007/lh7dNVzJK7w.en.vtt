 especially a so Schmidt the 3d effect of course in Spirent there are some 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.170

 and of course synonymous with videos to record videos in 3d is theirs 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.560
 a double 5 megapixel camera available 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.810

 grab 599 euros RRP Annecy for our conclusion after the first tests that 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.190
 3d-gaming is quite an interesting innovation, however, we felt 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.070
 after ten minutes, a certain eye pressure 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.710
