out of the the vaccine bags and what
we're<00:02:23.280> gonna<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.700> we're<00:02:23.940> gonna<00:02:24.000> let<00:02:24.360> it

let it set for two hours what you want
to<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.190> there's<00:02:32.370> gonna<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:33.090> what's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
to do is there's gonna be a what's

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.770 
to do is there's gonna be a what's
called<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> pellicle<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.640> will<00:02:35.820> form<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
called a pellicle that will form on the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.080 
called a pellicle that will form on the
surface<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.100> fish<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.610> basically<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
surface of the fish it's basically a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140 
surface of the fish it's basically a
protein<00:02:39.480> layer<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> locker<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.850> will

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
protein layer like a locker that will

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.380 
protein layer like a locker that will
allow<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.110> smoke<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.740> adhere<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.760> so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
allow the smoke to adhere to it so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.420 
allow the smoke to adhere to it so
that's<00:02:45.510> pretty<00:02:45.570> crucial<00:02:46.230> when<00:02:46.620> smoking

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's pretty crucial when smoking

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.190 
that's pretty crucial when smoking
salmon<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.600> gonna<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.870> ahead<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.140> do
