a hard time time to train and they're
very<00:00:58.109> good<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.039> fighting<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.559> it's<00:01:01.559> not<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
very good at fighting with so it's not a

very good at fighting with so it's not a
surprise

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 

but<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:04.950> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> glitch<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.210> once<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but you should you can glitch up once in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
but you should you can glitch up once in
a<00:01:06.600> while<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> edge<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.280> platforms

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a while on the edge of these platforms

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
a while on the edge of these platforms
if<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.300> do<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> properly<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:10.410> I've<00:01:10.680> never

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
if you do it properly which I've never

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.300 
if you do it properly which I've never
learned<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.970> couldn't<00:01:12.660> tell<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> how<00:01:13.160> all<00:01:14.160> i

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
learned so I couldn't tell you how all i

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.790 
learned so I couldn't tell you how all i
knows<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:15.360> far<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.990> i<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.200> i<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:16.770> just

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
knows as far as i know i think he just

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.410 
knows as far as i know i think he just
edge<00:01:17.220> towards<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:19.760> towards<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.940> edge<00:01:21.150> there

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
edge towards the towards the edge there

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
edge towards the towards the edge there
and<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.440> keep<00:01:22.740> bouncing<00:01:23.160> back<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.520> forth

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and he will keep bouncing back and forth

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:33.770 
and he will keep bouncing back and forth
oh<00:01:28.100> nice<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.050> too<00:01:31.260> hard<00:01:32.270> well<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
oh nice it's not too hard well you can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.810 
oh nice it's not too hard well you can
find<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:34.260> just<00:01:34.500> mean<00:01:34.680> since<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.430> takes<00:01:35.580> about

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
find with just mean since it takes about

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.810 
find with just mean since it takes about
30<00:01:36.120> shots<00:01:36.450> though<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.370> it's<00:01:38.580> really

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
30 shots though and it's not it's really

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
30 shots though and it's not it's really
not<00:01:38.910> worth<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.960> rather<00:01:40.110> use

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
not worth the time i would rather use

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
not worth the time i would rather use
your<00:01:40.440> super<00:01:40.710> missiles<00:01:41.070> unless<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> what

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
your super missiles unless you know what

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.320 
your super missiles unless you know what
you're<00:01:42.390> doing<00:01:42.660> really<00:01:42.840> well<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:45.210> ahead

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
you're doing really well then go ahead

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.490 
you're doing really well then go ahead
and<00:01:45.510> use<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> team<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:47.690> okay<00:01:48.690> now<00:01:49.170> we're

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and use a team you know okay now we're

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.080 
and use a team you know okay now we're
on<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.740> back<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.550> probably<00:01:50.850> should

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
on our way back and i probably should

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.750 
on our way back and i probably should
jump<00:01:51.300> but<00:01:51.600> whatever<00:01:52.369> make<00:01:53.369> sure<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.550> jump

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
jump but whatever make sure to jump

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.790 
jump but whatever make sure to jump
above<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.330> door<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.590> there

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
above the door is they can get in there

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.010 
above the door is they can get in there
on<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.570> you're<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.840> waste

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
on your way down you're not the waste

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.400 
on your way down you're not the waste
any<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:59.390> try<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> give<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.660> as<00:02:00.990> much<00:02:01.170> speed

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
any time try to give them as much speed

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.990 
any time try to give them as much speed
as<00:02:01.530> i'm<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> little<00:02:02.160> platform<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> can

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
as i'm a little platform that you can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.960 
as i'm a little platform that you can
now<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:03.960> gonna<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.170> much<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:04.970> could

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
now that it's gonna be much but could

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.040 
now that it's gonna be much but could
you<00:02:06.090> cross<00:02:06.300> quicker<00:02:06.740> common<00:02:07.740> sense<00:02:07.950> though

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
you cross quicker common sense though

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.590 
you cross quicker common sense though
and<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> probably<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> turn<00:02:10.980> off<00:02:11.100> your

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and you probably want to turn off your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.940 
and you probably want to turn off your
ice<00:02:12.600> cream<00:02:13.130> helps<00:02:15.110> not<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.140> freeze<00:02:16.500> things<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
ice cream helps not to freeze things and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
ice cream helps not to freeze things and
you<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.160> try<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> fully<00:02:17.760> charged<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.030> run<00:02:18.120> if

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
you can try a fully charged the run if

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.170 
you can try a fully charged the run if
you<00:02:18.959> aren't<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.760> then<00:02:20.760> speed

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
you aren't there in this then speed

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.850 
you aren't there in this then speed
speed<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.810> way<00:02:21.870> across<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.380> room<00:02:22.560> real

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
speed your way across this room real

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.699 
speed your way across this room real
fast<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.570> felt<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.900> felt<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> need

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
fast so if you felt like felt the need

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.890 
fast so if you felt like felt the need
anyway

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
anyway

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.319 
anyway
I<00:02:28.040> personally<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.069> don't<00:02:29.340> care

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
I personally just don't care
