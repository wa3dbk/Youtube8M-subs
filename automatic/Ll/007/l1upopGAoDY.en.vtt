00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.139
 fight lions of mercury 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.770
 quickly so I do not know if you have 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.840
 seen the last last episode that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.810
 I made a trick to have blanks 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 of mercury quickly so today 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.109
 for this video I will use this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 same trick so already the same tip that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 the last time and in addition for 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.570
 catch globes for ben yeah so 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930
 you want to catch mercury edges 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.090
 to quickly and kill them quickly 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.890
 I do not know if it's so if you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.829
 remember memory chips this is it a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.829
 two three and four 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.170
 you expect monsters are going to be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 happy to see her go like this to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.340
 the stairs normally so it's not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.040
 these usual patrimonies finally 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.080
 me it's not very good look up and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.360
 So here you have the time to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.510
 surprise 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 it will be good guy but why points of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.000
 sale and sometimes but that's because you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.759
 took it their major role funds 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.939
 for the turn it does not follow therefore the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.009
 common 3 survival and can not talk 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.020
 exactly 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 that is to say to do non- flying 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 so I'll explain to you for the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 beat quickly I'll make you 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.370
 see what it takes like if you have 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.340
 of course 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:55.120
 and then they attack that's what 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.770
 matters most so I'll have 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.600
 made 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.280
 2 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:08.039
 we waited at the portel for this beautiful 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.770
 world so for the tap that I have that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.630
 is divine divine thunder when 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 you want me wondered came so 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.500
 to have this attack 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.989
 equip yourself with a spear and have them 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 skills it takes because this attack 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.660
 is really very very effective against 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.019
 any monster otherwise who 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 is mercury well as I come from 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.790
 do or so multi cost that is not 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 bad too 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.819
 so you better get equipped normally 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.360
 of death sighs even royal 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:51.959
 if I understood correctly here and beat the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.380
 magic mouse so but no it's a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.640
 little weird in this concert of 5.2 I 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.140
 do not like that at sunset so hold ten 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.970
 twenty or a little con me me and often 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 but inflicts heavy damage in case of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.640
 success 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.280
 so after there is an amulet for 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.160
 increase rates to materialize if 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.000
 you have it metella cardy it's from the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.380
 to finally see how to have more 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.620
 chance to make a critical hit from 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:36.480
 this attack 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:39.299
 if not, then death is unfortunately 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.920
 he runs away so I'm going to make them a 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.350
 last time to make you see because 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.890
 that if not my ds we will unload 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:51.110
 mallardo by a two good us 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.130
 expected 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.340
 so I was going to say that to mercury 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.570
 come on now it would be great 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.940
 so at least 5 minutes you can between 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.070
