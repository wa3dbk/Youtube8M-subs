00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.510
 hello people i do that today 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.240
 Nails video of essence 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.670
 I would have it now 15 days ago 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.380
 and you see it is not like that 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.119
 so much is happening to me 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 they're actually pretty good at it 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.849
 everything that happened that here on 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.710
 I grow up a bit out of the beginning 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.079
 have a bit of a hint who but you 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.759
 See, that's really just completely 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.730
 little and completely spoke in the right 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.800
 hand looks similar 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 So for durability now ever 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.750
 ten rubber points but I have to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.210
 to say that they are really hard nails 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.640
 have and nail polish with me anyway 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.260
 very very long do without that I 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.149
 Great thing to do so I have 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.989
 simple by nature rather hard and 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.579
 healthy nails and that's why I can 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.629
 Do not say it softer now 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.079
 rules are there, it probably is 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.309
 faster off and there the nails too 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.539
 intervened 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.519
 I do not know what it looks like now 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.870
 if I do the whole thing but me 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.150
 think that not so much then 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.880
 but I am doing that now 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.100
 I'll take it from now on 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.100
 here are some tweezers and try me 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 Let's start here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 I'll just start with the little one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.470
 is easier with the nail 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.360
 I heard that you are not like that 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.430
 should pull off from back to front 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.259
 but the basalt light has the franzi 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.610
 said this I really link 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.729
 forgotten past last hobbies 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.079
 which has already made all these things and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.530
 yes then you can only look is 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.340
 with her, of course, it was a frieze 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.450
 work is supposed to be so in one 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 go down 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.680
 but I have also been here for a very long time 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.140
 Maybe that's it or because of it 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.090
 I simply the base code in the place 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.950
 but have made it too thin so the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.750
 first nail down and than however 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.259
 worse than I thought maybe 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.600
 Do you see this in the middle of this one? 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.430
 bit nail was demolished and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 I think if that grows out now 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.010
 then the front is pretty pretty 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.300
 brittle but there was nothing to do 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.280
 It was not so easy now either 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.770
 Maybe I have 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.170
 I applied too little baseball myself 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.340
 do not know, but I just hope that it 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 with the other media now 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.080
 a little bit better is all about that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.830
 good is here now is a job there 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.989
 is that from the top off pretty much 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.640
 So not many around the world 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.720
 Most ask and I do that now 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.180
 just ever with nail polish remover 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.500
 Just get off here on his moped and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 then take that down with it 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.420
 I see where I am still able to do that 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.810
 then it has to scratch down 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.370
 that's right, and I'm okay 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.100
 there is something here and there and I see it too 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.350
 still where these are based on until then me 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.269
 even under scratch must see it 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 the second brand from which it also a 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.850
 a bit broken 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 yes, I think it's a pity the nails 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.870
 yes, pretty much me though 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.370
 really pretty strong nails I have 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.340
 I do not know if I will give it away again 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 Nails would recommend but I have too 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.340
 it is even heard by people 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.750
 nothing happened so I think so 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.069
 you just have to try it out if that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 works for him or not 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.549
 if you really have to try it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840
 I want to do it but it really can 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.870
 be that in the lid then too 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.160
 a bit broken are wrong 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.140
 they indeed before that which you have in it 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.519
 This application is easy to see 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.850
 from another nail polish I 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.070
 before that it just had to 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.890
 the nails has turned yellow that is so 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.299
 it brings nothing to the nails so what 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.769
 indicating that the nails are broken 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.090
 or so with me someone and the video 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.130
 wrote yes if you have an angel 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.470
 so broken you should not have any 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.150
 open up regulated 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.859
 they are not broken are only four hab 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.500
 that's like when the band strokes the 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.380
 is not fragile or broken after that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.060
 now has a different color and yes so 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.150
 I 'll finish everything and 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.040
 shows you how it looks then as a 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.079
 half an hour later, if I even still 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.200
 longer when I finish you see that 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.940
 whole dÃ¶ns selst time is a whole 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.079
 piece and most of the time is then 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.200
 even only the top layer with 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.660
 departed and a bit of 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.430
 nail polish but the nail polish needed to 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.739
 I then paint with and that with 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.139
 nail polish remover and 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.139
 Scrape off the bottom layer again 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.509
 that was a lot of work now 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.810
 and yes, my angel does not go that far 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:33.199
 well so at least so they look very 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:38.419
 dried out and some is too 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:40.210
 yes, looks like with a set trial 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.139
 to show 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:48.440
 So as I said, they are anyway 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:49.729
 discolored but does not look so pretty 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.849
 I am also happy when I die 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.349
 can cut so if I have now 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.300
 Get it made this place go there 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:02.780
 were already relatively long now 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.370
 two weeks later they have to go but yes 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.409
 I will definitely mean it now 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.909
 Use polish of essences and 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.520
 Then just cut a bit 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.560
 and then look how it looks like and 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.479
 yes, I'll show you that again 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.180
 I have come far now my angel 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.349
 are now shortened and truncate peoples 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.050
 I could not then cut myself 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.729
 in the skin down here because many always 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.770
 mean if I have it on and after 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.080
 This so short I should be my angel 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.219
 but cut again but tilted 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.389
 will not I have a big 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:34.909
 lagerbett so goes me so 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.840
 have isolated white spots her 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.820
 can see 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.039
 they are just polished then 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.570
 do not go away so that means you go 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.710
 Just a little deeper into the nail 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.090
 but I think it's okay because 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.530
 If I for example times blitzer 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.030
 I have worn the nail polish 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.219
 partially deducted then say 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.509
 my energy exactly that makes the 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.909
 not so much choice now 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.810
 said to be quite vigorous and thick 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:02.780
 and healthy I'm doing now first 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.460
 normal nail polish on it and not 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.650
 directly the yellow angel reflected 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.969
 but I definitely wanted to go back 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.930
 even if the nails do that too 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.810
 a bit broken 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.460
 But I will not quite do it again 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.319
 so long because I have that 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.729
 Feel like I'm so long on it 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.500
 read that nails then somehow 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.669
 I am particularly hard-hit 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.470
 I do not know if I'm a sign 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.630
 or no idea 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.650
 I have the feeling it is like that 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.260
 I will be next time 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.610
 Leave a week at most and 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.390
 then look like the nails then 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.740
 appearance 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.360
 I have to decide each one myself 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.800
 if he wants to do that then but not 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.020
 I really liked it visually now 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.590
 very nice it was the whole time 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.970
 about totally shiny and so I liked it 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.810
 That's why it stops 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.300
 also do it again 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.460
 but yes the nails are really stopped 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.120
 attacked by the other at more 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.770
 the other less and yes well I hope 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.400
 I have now said all that comes to 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.750
 little before 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.100
 I 'll do my nails again 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.260
 finish and show yourself then again 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.750
 simply so have a nice end 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.930
 image at the end I can not even 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.870
 I talk perceived twenty years later 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.180
 i have made my nails now i have 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.970
 Now it's full and we paint this plant 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.030
 made that this new one is hand 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:19.430
 nail polish that means I always find the 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:20.480
 color not in utah is the 163 yes me 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.980
 think it's great 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.220
 However, one need two 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.640
 layers and leather dries the us 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.200
 footballer but yes if he first 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.660
 is dry then draws the 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.460
 nice looking and yes 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.580
 I can now with the next day 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.050
 also good loving what i hope 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.300
 really nothing to forget the 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.100
 to say that you have seen the 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.870
 Nails after cream and mine are 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.169
 really really solid and healthy 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.570
 but it had attacked anyway 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:52.280
 well, if you still have questions ask 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.310
 she just then I answer the 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.310
 Of course, still and otherwise good 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:03.400
 I'm applying a relatively thick layer 

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:08.529
 curious if I can do that it is 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:10.330
 the very thick instructions 

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:12.819
 that you make four nails at once 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.139
 should and then the thumb to the end I 

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.749
 But I heard that it is quite good 

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.749
 if you just have two fingers 

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:18.749
 together takes
