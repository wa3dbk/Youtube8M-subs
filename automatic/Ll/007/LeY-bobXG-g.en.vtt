00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.559
 Nice flat my notes again today 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.830
 Oh crappy lecturer Max Vailey 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:15.060
 Seventh Time Seventh Day 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.060
 I will join you in learning 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 I've created a sample file . 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 Import'm Haeju 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.580
 I came in. 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.580
 I did it this time. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.530
 One of the members of the Mousobun once, so I have a little bit of progress 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 I have to send it out. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.350
 I hope you worry That's mean slow Oh skills in two minutes wonak 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.090
 same 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.090
 I think I'll teach the season later . 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:02.600
 What you learn today'm going to come about as one kind of tv-to-Max 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.040
 Two things and 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.040
 Mapping and 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.950
 It's something that can happen at any time in the building makes water toilets 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.950
 water 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.770
 Oh, no more talk. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.190
 Just a moment. This is my example file. 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:30.340
 I have ahkkan company's men and women are also itneungeogo 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.340
 This is because too large a chunk woman decorating the Day 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.110
 Water expression 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.810
 There are various ways of expressing water. I can teach you only one or two of them . 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.829
 It is. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 The things we write 8 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:55.390
 If I look at the contents of my lecture, I am a little bit different than the others. 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 What features do you have to explain a lot 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.740
 I think it is all I think it is, of course, I think the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.050
 I think it 's because I want to be my lecture . 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.039
 They are listening and one is talking. 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.980
 For example, to learn CAD 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:18.360
 In fact , it's not that much to learn. 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.879
 I want to learn CAD in the interior. 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.440
 Some 110 kinds extent it will be difficult going straight from easy as drawing Apartments 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.540
 Degree 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.400
 Well, just like that, 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.489
 I'm trying to draw the skill. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.620
 I'm looking at 30 to 100 times and 100 to 1 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:44.090
 I 'm trying to figure out my 200th job. 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.140
 Then now I do not see the hand size loose lines way to change the color index 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.370
 To go 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.120
 Layer'll see how to disconnect asked to draw again and the second 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.359
 Will 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.540
 Do not bring model 2 and draw a chair. 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:02.650
 Well than look painted over a week, 10 different styles around double 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.280
 That's when Max is the mental x . 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.490
 Such a basket 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:14.940
 Almost a third four dollars yesterday'm kind of hard to suck his mistakes 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:19.980
 I can draw a CAD drawing right away. 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:26.340
 The color of the line, the column, the structure, the surface should be yellow and the partition wall 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:29.130
 What we have to do is to be green and that's all. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.160
 When you deliver this, who 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:38.340
 And then, in color architecture, 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:44.220
 If you do not leave any that was manually entered exactly that what this import 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.560
 I do not know if it's a line, so it's correct to put in the correct color. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.140
 But 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.489
 Most just in our interior state is inde consumers tell consumers Seocheon 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.020
 The color was wrong. 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.980
 If the recipient is not indicated 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.830
 If the scale is wrong or you are now doing construction, 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.830
 I gave you the wrong scale. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.610
 There is a problem in the structural part 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.650
 If you do not make a mistake or you 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:20.410
 These things can be a problem. 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:24.490
 The color of the line was wrong. 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.740
 This is why we go to the natnya saekgal go buy something with red inde each priority What 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 Why is it yellow? 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.790
 These people do not have that person to come see this person 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.729
 He 's wrong. 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.419
 The sense there might be right, and what could be wrong 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.740
 That's why I just keep working on what I'm working on as a template 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:50.240
 Repeat and repeat. 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.259
 I will teach you how to prepare for your learning. 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.529
 But 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.900
 I do it myself. 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:04.310
 That is why 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.310
 Today, you'll have to try it to learn this simple example template 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.950
 First,
