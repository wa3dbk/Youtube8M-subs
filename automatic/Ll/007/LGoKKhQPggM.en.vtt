00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:05.107
&lt;i&gt;[P.A. Announcer] Entry number 23,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mr. A. Hoggett with Pig.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:07.345
[Crowd Laughing]

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.708
&lt;i&gt;[Commentator]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is just too crazy to believe.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:39.378
&lt;i&gt;And if that isn't enough.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We have a stray dog on the field.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:41.045
&lt;i&gt;They trying to round him up?&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:45.582
&lt;i&gt;The dog's gonna give a few tips&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on how to be a sheep pig.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.390
[Laughing]

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:54.730
[Panting]

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.474
Well, it's up to him now.

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:20.661
Away to me, Pig.

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:24.355
&lt;i&gt;[Crowd Laughing]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.801
[Laughing]
Get off!

00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:39.544
Baa, ram, ewe.
Baa, ram, ewe!

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:43.313
To your breed, your fleece,
your clan be true.

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:46.254
&lt;i&gt;Sheep be true.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Baa, ram, ewe.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:49.987
What... What did you say?

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.827
[Man]
Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.527
[Sobbing]

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:04.097
There, there, Esme.
It's not the end of the world.

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:08.271
&lt;i&gt;[Commentator] Is hejust going to&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;stand there until his time runs out?&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.781
&lt;i&gt;Or could this be&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;some sort of protest?&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.614
&lt;i&gt;Maybe we should line up an&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;interview with the sheep pig?&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:16.177
&lt;i&gt;Or the sheep pig's trainer.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:18.553
He's a lively sort of fellow
by the looks of things.

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.491
&lt;i&gt;[Commentator]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Good heavens!&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:46.852
Hey!
Shh.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.547
&lt;i&gt;[Horse]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's Babe!&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:02.261
l-l...
