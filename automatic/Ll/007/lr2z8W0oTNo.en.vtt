you a couple of stories and like very
simple<00:00:29.710> things<00:00:29.950> that<00:00:30.310> really<00:00:30.910> make<00:00:31.210> the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
simple things that really make the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.910 
simple things that really make the
difference<00:00:31.420> because<00:00:32.079> I<00:00:32.110> mean<00:00:32.290> sometimes<00:00:32.529> it's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
difference because I mean sometimes it's

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.660 
difference because I mean sometimes it's
so<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:34.149> so<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:34.750> easy<00:00:34.780> when<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.920> mean<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.430> do

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
so it's so so easy when you I mean to do

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.000 
so it's so so easy when you I mean to do
something<00:00:37.060> very<00:00:37.390> big<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:38.020> very<00:00:38.079> extreme<00:00:38.860> when

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
something very big and very extreme when

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.620 
something very big and very extreme when
you<00:00:39.100> know<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.550> gaps<00:00:39.760> when<00:00:40.060> you<00:00:40.150> know<00:00:40.270> that<00:00:40.450> gas

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
you know the gaps when you know that gas

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.110 
you know the gaps when you know that gas
is<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.810> VIP<00:00:41.170> or<00:00:41.380> something<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.820> think<00:00:43.060> that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
is a VIP or something but I think that

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.240 
is a VIP or something but I think that
what<00:00:43.630> really<00:00:43.840> matters<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.860> makes<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
what really matters and makes the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.370 
what really matters and makes the
difference<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.850> when<00:00:46.780> you<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:46.989> small<00:00:47.350> things

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
difference is when you do small things

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.620 
difference is when you do small things
and<00:00:47.920> those<00:00:48.640> things<00:00:48.880> that<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.180> can<00:00:49.329> do<00:00:49.450> to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
and those things that you can do to

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.670 
and those things that you can do to
everyone<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.430> for<00:00:52.300> example<00:00:52.420> when<00:00:52.930> when<00:00:53.320> I<00:00:53.350> was

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
everyone so for example when when I was

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.000 
everyone so for example when when I was
