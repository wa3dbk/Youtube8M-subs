00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 super bravo victory was until 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.040
 butt with the guts was 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 to look for her 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.210
 yeah sure but first really 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.960
 thank you thank you all because you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.960
 really pushed me 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.680
 it is on these resumes your breath 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.329
 very complicated damages I knew that 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.020
 I was going to have to run a lot I think 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.309
 that I fought I believed in 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.750
 me until the end really in 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.699
 the weights you really pushed me to 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.089
 every time it's magic here not 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.089
 so magical 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.370
 exactly where did you find 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.010
 this energy had gone to two points 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.989
 from victory to fourth you've been 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.790
 often selling there were plenty of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.940
 turnaround how you 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.940
 do 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 I honestly have to think about 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.260
 very simple things really take 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.490
 part for me it was not easy i'm going 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.320
 so really quickly I try to 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.830
 hang on I said to myself here it's going 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.290
 one moment 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.940
 a weakness a second ball a little 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.650
 right fault to powder acceleration 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.440
 I really try to take you to each 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.510
 point every time and I believe I have 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.410
 a small opportunity I managed to 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.410
 to do and here I am 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.280
 and I'm sure that having your 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.430
 dad in the stands the dot of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.380
 the energy also me it's sure it's me 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.460
 does good that I believe it happens 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.990
 my father my mother too my little brother 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.160

 thank you thank you bridge 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 I imagine you can have legs 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.540
 very heavy 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.820
 now room for recovery because 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 that you have another tough match that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.640
 waiting for you against gulbis me for sure 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.900

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.890
 do is get well 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.259
 I heard it was raining 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 perhaps an extra day but really 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.890
