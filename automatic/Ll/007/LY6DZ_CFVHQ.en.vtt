00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.340
cars dot com auto review

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.400
Hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars.com this is the 2013 Acura

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.180
ILX  it's an all new sedan comes in
three versions on one

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.510
hand you've got a higher ed on the other
end you've got the 2.4 which has a 200

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.080
horsepower

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.690
2.4 liter four-cylinder and in the
middle you got this one

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.810
the ilex 2.0 it as a 2-liter
four-cylinder

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.880
and a 150 horsepower that's one of the
main things

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.739
that distinguishes it from the Honda
Civic on which it's based

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.100
to in several years since Acura based

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.949
a car on a Honda Civic that was the RSX
a sportier number

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.229
they insist that this is a different
approach

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.580
and then it's more than just a dialed up
civic it's about an inch and a half

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.409
wider it's a little bit lower the
torsional rigidity the the actual

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.059
strengthen the structure is higher

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.549
and their number of other mechanical
changes as well the two liter

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:57.420
four-cylinder

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.070
paired with a a five-speed automatic
transmission is a nice combo for this

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.489
car

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.409
it's quick enough not super quick the
five-speed automatic is pretty well

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.430
behaved the kicks down pretty quickly
when you go to pass I feel a little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.479
quicker than the Civic

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.689
for that matter different shock
absorbers in the Civic they're called

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.479
amplitude reactive pampers

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.689
which are intended to be soft term for
the ride quality

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.829
but without giving up some other
protection against really big bumps and

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.359
shocks

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.920
I they do a good job but definitely
rides well you know I can confuse the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.829
car for civic

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.689
I'll be still feel the service the road
you know what kinda road you're going

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:30.130
over

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.320
terms of handling the cars okay and as
this imbalance but it's not something

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200
that begs you to drive really fast

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.899
then there's the steering actor says the
steering has been changed it has a

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.920
larger diameter steering shaft and a
faster ratio

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.909
up unfortunately I don't think steering
feel is that good it's a little bit numb

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.299
I I seen better even with electric power
steering which is what this one has

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.609
actor took many steps to control noise
in this car

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.549
compared with the civic of course a
thicker when does

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.850
mora insulation all around and also
there's an active noise cancellation

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.520
feature

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.069
on miles with 17-inch wheels they've
done a pretty good job it's a quiet car

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.209
but it's not an exceptionally quiet car
at highway speeds but it's not a serene

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.980
as the Buick Verano

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.129
a which is an apt comparison because
it's another premium sedan

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.110
same size and it is based on a Chevrolet
Cruze

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.459
so there's that comparison to the cruise
compares with the Civic in terms of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.060
quietness

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.930
I think I go through around was gonna
confuse the interior of the ilex with

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.280
a Honda Civic %uh it's pretty nicely
done is very familiar Acura

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.680
layout to it a mix of materials most im
it's pretty comfortable

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.780
where you put your arms on top the doors
soft armrests all soft given the task

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.230
force got a soft and low gloss which is
good

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.830
I really like the a bezel here from the
center control panels an interesting

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.080
look

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.159
not as crazy though about the plastic
piece over stuff which so many

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.920
manufacturers are getting away from

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.349
also the plastic on the leading edge up
the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.530
armrests somehow looks particularly
plasticky

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.909
having a technology packages car also
has the top level seats which are

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.500
a perforated leather with of finals side
bolsters

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.049
if you get the lower levels you get plop
some vinyl

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.379
as well um I have to mention the the
color in this is

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.590
is a nice way to break up the inside
this car because generally speaking

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.860
actor goes with blacks and grays in a
little bit a silver

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.349
so many competitors are experimenting
with color nowadays I think they really

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.269
need to branch out

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.379
they can stay competitive luxury brands

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.340
market small cars like this they do a
balancing act they wanted to be

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.700
affordable enough to be attractive to
buyers but they don't wanna see the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.950
cheapening the brand

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.150
a twenty six thousand dollars to start
for the ilex

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.750
on up I mention the Buick Verano a
buncha times

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.939
it starts thirty five hundred dollars
cheaper and its top trim level

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.920
is equal to the 26,000 I love the ilex
here where it starts and that one comes

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.680
with leather a lot of the other goodies

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.849
then there's another question do they
need and I'll acts

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.810
when there's a the Acura TSX for thirty
thousand dollars it's only a little bit

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.510
larger

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.840
then there's the even larger question
what we've been asking for a while

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.290
which is is their demand for small
premium sedans like this

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.290
that we'll have to see over time

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.250
