00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.510 

what<00:00:54.240> I<00:00:54.270> said<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.350> marathon<00:00:55.530> route<00:00:56.220> in

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
what I said about the marathon route in

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.120 
what I said about the marathon route in
it<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> bury<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> stem<00:00:57.740> well<00:00:58.740> as<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
it when you bury the stem well as you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.420 
it when you bury the stem well as you
can<00:00:59.280> see<00:01:00.500> started<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
can see started going up there and the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.590 
can see started going up there and the
roots<00:01:02.790> look<00:01:04.880> group<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.120> all<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.450> way

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
roots look group you know all the way

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940 
roots look group you know all the way
along<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.170> why<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.440> get<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.650> much<00:01:07.770> energy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
along that's why they get so much energy

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530 
along that's why they get so much energy
because<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.550> broke<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:09.000> along<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.300> flanks

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because they broke all along the flanks

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.180 
because they broke all along the flanks
are<00:01:09.930> spitting<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> thought<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> pull<00:01:11.040> them

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
are spitting I thought we to pull them

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.310 
are spitting I thought we to pull them
out<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.300> mara<00:01:18.690> rubbish

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
out right so that's all the mara rubbish

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
out right so that's all the mara rubbish
cleared<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.090> say<00:01:21.300> they're

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
cleared now but if you can say they're

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.790 
cleared now but if you can say they're
still<00:01:21.570> lobs<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.790> lots<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.910> weeds<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.800> annual

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
still lobs a lots of weeds in annual

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.040 
still lobs a lots of weeds in annual
ways<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.850> creeping<00:01:27.660> buttered

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
ways like this this is creeping buttered

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.780 
ways like this this is creeping buttered
crap<00:01:28.259> they're<00:01:28.440> not<00:01:28.590> bought<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.800> cress<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
crap they're not bought a cress it's a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
crap they're not bought a cress it's a
dress<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> car<00:01:30.540> let<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
dress I think the car let that's not a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
dress I think the car let that's not a
big<00:01:32.070> problem<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.759> dig<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
big problem you can just dig that in and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
big problem you can just dig that in and
it'll<00:01:33.509> die<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.050> things<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.410> nettles

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it'll die but things like nettles

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.430 
it'll die but things like nettles
obviously<00:01:35.369> they're<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.550> perennial<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
obviously they're a perennial and you

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.200 
obviously they're a perennial and you
want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> dig<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.280> roots<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> I'll<00:01:39.060> get

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
want to dig those out roots and I'll get

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.560 
want to dig those out roots and I'll get
all<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.390> ropes<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.820> leave<00:01:42.060> any<00:01:42.240> bits<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
all the ropes out you leave any bits of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
all the ropes out you leave any bits of
out<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> leave<00:01:44.790> any<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.090> ropes<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:45.979> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
out you leave any of the ropes it that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.910 
out you leave any of the ropes it that's
how<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.280> spread<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.820> propagate<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.450> cells

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
how they spread and propagate the cells

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200 
how they spread and propagate the cells
get<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.040> much<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.670> rope<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.910> was

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
get as much of the rope that was

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
get as much of the rope that was
possible<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.750> say<00:01:52.260> we'll<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.620> spreads<00:01:57.409> just

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
possible you say we'll just spreads just

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
possible you say we'll just spreads just
it<00:01:58.680> forget<00:01:59.610> all<00:01:59.760> your<00:01:59.909> perennials<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.540> like
