00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.470
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.470
 ninth video 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.020
 with other pools let's see the 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 raps 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 surely more than once has happened to you 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 that you have a candle 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.110
 surely it has happened to more than one 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.950
 that you have a hard-to-reach candle 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.950
 to light it 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.079
 we see that it becomes impossible for us 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.649
 only we will need will be a 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.649
 Spaghetti 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 to 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.980
 and then we will see how to make a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.470
 guard to do is very cheap 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 We will only need a folio first 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.810
 What we will do is put the cde out 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.810
 in half now we will fold this side 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.930
 we take it from this position and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 bent 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.390
 now we will have to fold this part 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.460
 no no 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.070
 finally we will have to double the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.070
 points are you in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 and finally we will only have to close 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.750
 and we already have our super fede guard 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.750
 cheap now if we want we can paint 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.300
 How do you say in english 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 on many occasions if we are in the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 cook and we want to read our book of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430
 recipes 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.160
 it's quite uncomfortable to be all the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.530
 while having to approach to read 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.290
 very bad not so now we will see a 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 solution for this we will only need 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 a clothes hanger 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.980
 no no 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.360
 how 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.590
 the man overcomes it back or that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.819
 bigmac with luxe potatoes and missing 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.640
 tired of making you a sandwich hitting him 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.670
 snack and that there is little cold in that 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 zone now we will see a hack so that 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.600
 this does not happen to us 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.500

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.500
 I've split them in half 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.019
 you know what the blood group of the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.019
 fat the appetizer 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.440

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.450
 quick greeting to a couple of subscribers 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.450
 that they have asked me for a kiss for the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.300
 Sauro song

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.910
 respond to a subscriber who 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.530
 asked how to end mosquitoes 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.690

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.570
 I want to go deeper into another video 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.000
 but while you can try 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.910
 mosquito nets in the window or in the bed 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 like there in Africa or in places so 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.520
 they use and it goes very well and if you can not 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.860
 try a glass of vinegar or put 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.979
 a bag of water I hope that I have 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.729
 come in there remember to close the 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.729
 door to leave
