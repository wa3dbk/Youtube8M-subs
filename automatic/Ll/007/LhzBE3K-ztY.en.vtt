 make sure your opponent 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.930
 stopping consoles in encognure on 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.180
 xbox yesterday remove the clubs name so 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.310
 yes when you are in the market 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.690
 We do not want to see who sells what 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.520
 before there was the club name of 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.050
 people who were selling the player 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.730
 now there's more so you have to 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 really as they say respect the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.210
 starting price is the price the purchase 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.399
 we will offer you 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.479
 below I show you that right now 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.670
 otherwise we will not be credits it's 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.590
 what they read important so we 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.130
 will buy your player at the purchase price 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.069
 immediate 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.679
 we will not make you the player must not 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.210
 listed multiple players not listed 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.729
 several days otherwise we will not buy 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.079
 the player finally several same players 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.060
 in fact often listed several same 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.749
 players otherwise will not throw the player for 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.609
 set the duration to three days and the tax 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.159
 of 5% said she will not be understood by 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.869
 the site so or you will lose 5% everything 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.100
 that you bought what there are 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.090
 texts and attack 100% dice common sense a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.469
 transmitted credit but 300000 -5% then there 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.549
 we are in the players at 308 fear 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.469
 that basically there you had to choose a 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.789
 player then there is the airlock and yes 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.639
 it's the dilemma then you 're going to say 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.520
 but why for example in this day 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:52.899
 there ok I'm going to buy 200 miles credit 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.270
 I can sell 310000 credit of accor 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.829
 but I had to buy 200 miles 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.479
 credit so in fact I won that 110 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.649
 miles credit and yes I want to say 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 yeah that's right, that's right 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.719
 problem with actually with the with the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.029
 price range is now little 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.050
 more for sale as before so this is 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.640
 why this technique anyway 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.750
 now less used and that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.929
 young people prefer rather to buy 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.610
 a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 an account with the credits on it or 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 recharge their account 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.540
 but not this technique has it after 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.239
 that's up to you to see if it's more 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.409
 easy we'll say but that's if you 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.670
 can not win much 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.799
 a lot of credit if we basically 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.819
 it's 10 euros 110000 credit in russia 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.780
 to teens justin 100- mile players 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 after what he saw in a pack by 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.489
 example you're going to have all 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.299
 credits because you are going to sell it 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.549
 because it does not create a lot of people 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.480
 who are buying right now so here's in 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.859
 big this is a little bit 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 the disadvantage for that to you to see 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.200
 but I was gnawing that player you click 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.540
 above 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.909
 so you see that the name of the player is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.590
 appeared here the starting price is ranked 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.620
 media if you click multiple times 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.169
 above you see that the price of the price 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.810
 pardon start buying finally cursed 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.370
 change so basically you do not care 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.760
 mans where you choose a price from 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.109
 start you put here the others 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760
 addresses in already yes why it's 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.540
 important it means man will play 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.430
 the passes very loudly why it's worth 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.010
 310000 credit actually you look good 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 but look at the notes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.849
 this is the map 74 very important 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.139
 when we surf a helper we see that the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.000
 war 74 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.729
 it's a map that shows 5300 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.299
 ludivine credit on xbox so so that's 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.639
 for that 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.720
 so well paid attention to the general 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.909
 players do not like the card 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.349
 normal boost graveyard and that's where 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.040
 you put your e-mail address 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.049
 you guys at your payment method 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 you put here the coupon that my 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.530
 garment coupons if you want to cvca there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.260
 so dedicated tvk there is you are going to have 5% 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 reduction is not bad you do 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.019
 check out and lo and behold after then 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.299

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.769
