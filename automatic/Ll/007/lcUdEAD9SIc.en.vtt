one<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> their<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.530> electric<00:01:14.159> guitars<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
one of their first electric guitars that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
one of their first electric guitars that
they've<00:01:15.390> introduced<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.920> seems<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> be

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
they've introduced and it seems to be

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
they've introduced and it seems to be
the<00:01:17.400> natural<00:01:17.580> evolution<00:01:18.149> from<00:01:19.140> their

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the natural evolution from their

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
the natural evolution from their
acoustic<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.100> making<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.430> electric<00:01:20.790> guitar

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
acoustic to making an electric guitar

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
acoustic to making an electric guitar
using<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.140> same<00:01:22.350> technologies<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:22.950> used<00:01:23.190> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
using the same technologies they used in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.350 
using the same technologies they used in
the<00:01:23.460> past<00:01:23.899> obviously<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:26.360> noticeable

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the past obviously the most noticeable

thing about a bass guitar of course is
the<00:01:29.640> soundboard<00:01:30.179> and<00:01:30.300> what<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.780> here

the soundboard and what they have here
is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> lateral<00:01:31.500> compression<00:01:32.369> soundboard

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
is a lateral compression soundboard

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.990 
is a lateral compression soundboard
where<00:01:33.630> basically<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.770> strings<00:01:35.220> exert

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
where basically the strings exert

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
where basically the strings exert
tension<00:01:36.539> over<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.929> soundboard<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.590> improve

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
tension over the soundboard to improve

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.570 
tension over the soundboard to improve
resonance<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.140> sustain<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.950> other<00:01:41.130> thing<00:01:41.399> to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
resonance and sustain the other thing to

on the bridge and I will blend
paison<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.879> magnetic<00:03:06.269> until<00:03:06.659> I<00:03:06.689> get<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.290> fully

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
paison the magnetic until I get to fully

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.130 
paison the magnetic until I get to fully
magnetic<00:03:07.970> or<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.269> these<00:03:09.450> pickups<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.049> you
