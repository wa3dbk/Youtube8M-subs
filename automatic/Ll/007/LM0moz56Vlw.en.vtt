00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
really amazing even if you think that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
really amazing even if you think that
three<00:01:23.850> years<00:01:24.119> ago<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> Formula<00:01:25.290> One<00:01:25.470> his

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
three years ago that the Formula One his

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.170 
three years ago that the Formula One his
ship<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:27.229> around<00:01:28.229> 40<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.220> means<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
ship time was around 40 so means that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.569 
ship time was around 40 so means that
really<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.320> closer<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> Formula<00:01:32.700> One

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
really to be closer to the Formula One
