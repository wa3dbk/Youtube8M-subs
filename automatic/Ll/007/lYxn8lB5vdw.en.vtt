00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
ochem celebration but personally I think

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.750 
ochem celebration but personally I think
this<00:02:22.320> one<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.800> best<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.430> was<00:02:23.550> just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
this one is the best and it was just

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
this one is the best and it was just
done<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.300> well<00:02:24.540> no<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.260> expected<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
done so well no one expected it so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.370 
done so well no one expected it so
that's<00:02:26.550> why<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> alka<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.990> nowhere

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
