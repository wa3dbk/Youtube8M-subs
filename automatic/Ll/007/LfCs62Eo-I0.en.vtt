00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.620
 israel the old comrade 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.630
 4 slide track fans down and then 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.219
 they are removed 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:19.800
 see if they are still in good shape 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:24.230
 son i wanna talk all that rubber 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.230
 must demolish it off the roof 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.289
 they fly beautifully 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.039
 and skin have another 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 and supply of that so we are already going one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.969
 also pick up the plan later 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 everything is demolished and we burn the firewood 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.219
 the happy mix of it is that with the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.219
 user 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.350
 we started demolition this morning 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.329
 it is now noon and it is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 as far as the squares can be removed 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 to become 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.540
 or the tracks as ben in the Netherlands 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 says everything is being demolished 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.380
 because everything is renewed through to your 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.380
 likes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.420
 and this is what demolition looks like on the inside 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 it also turned out it looks like sir 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 christo 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.659
 has been to the house 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.659
 to grab 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.079
 but yes when it rains with the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 sandwich covers otherwise everything gets soaked 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.320
 within 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.630
 the construction progresses on the tracks 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.630
 are laid on it 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.909
 and they are attached 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.510
 this way they get stuck 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:22.349
 yes and that 's how things are done very quickly 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.349
 filthy from god very beautiful 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.689
 real mountains just someone like me so is that 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.530
 first a drywall your way on it 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.599
 traces the then the insulation comes there I too 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 I also isolation and is the drywall 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:51.120
 we think the fin is far too expensive 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.120
 so we just do that ourselves 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.629
 good can upstairs 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.410
 rain 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.730
 just sit down that I am neatly closed 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.830
 roof is covered with gyproc plates and now 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 the insulation places come out that are 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.730
 they speak the silvery appearance 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.730
 looking at focus pile 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.210
 a little glue comes between the screw 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.210
 you in it and then they are stuck 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.080
 the day it is covered with insulation plates that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.310
 have an aluminum exterior 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.310
 you are taped with tape 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.360
 the insulation is on now come the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.050
 corrugated sheets on top of the insulation and them 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.050
 be screwed down 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:11.860
 so simple guess that the small corner must 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.780
 off place so arrive three 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.780
 plates on each other may not be obvious 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.310
 well ask you fasten 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:29.680
 which builds through it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:32.130
 screw is the big screw to it 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.130
 one 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.340
 gets to the wine 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.910
 rice as last become the pans 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.060
 laid on it 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.210
 we put them in a little specie 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:13.410
 little lime space we are young students 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:15.870
 they stay well French and some 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.400
 pan not fix it 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.300
 which then get a small hook 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.050
 there so that they stick together can 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.150
 nice wind 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.420
 so we want them to stay 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.420
 lie 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.950
 so of course see it again 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.380
 what it looks like from the inside 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.850
 finished 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.890
 painted so does it look out 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.130
 old wood is brown and it is new construction 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.130
 black 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.340
 good luck
