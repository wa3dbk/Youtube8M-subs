00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.240
 what is going on from review to big blue yes the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 heide park has always been a trailblazer 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.970
 New costa and 1983 man too 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 had one of the first with big loop 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 Germany's big looping roller coaster 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.460
 secured 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 the way oma double dip doing corkscrew 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 Arrives at a height of 30 meters 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 whopping 63 km / h 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.790
 in this model, the name of the 8 abs 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.700
 program there are two loopings one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.050
 turn to screw a helix yet 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 in front of the station and then what it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 actually already but what am I 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 Most noticeable and so determined 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.180
 is not built anymore is the 40 meters 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 long straight piece between first drop 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.000
 and the first looping was easy 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.000
 does not make any sense 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.090
 In the office clear-cut knock out calls there 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.880
 can the hardened weko man by the way 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 in holland the whole team is driving 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:12.210
 is identical in efteling but what times 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 must mention what some do not know 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.450
 which often goes down or wrong 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 The dutch countries were passed on 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.030
 the first one has this path 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.890
 1981 then Peter and already in the park so 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.180
 wanted a replica holland 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 is not logically welcome 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 Dutch company finch weather yes that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.130
 will he shit so I wish you 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.860
 Now have fun and good advice with 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.300

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.240
 I'll see you at the next video 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'm out of euro pro was really 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.630
