for rothorn predicting the surf and this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230 
for rothorn predicting the surf and this
is<00:01:48.450> where<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.049> pull<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.100> fire<00:01:50.549> blast<00:01:50.970> which

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
is where I pull out the fire blast which

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
is where I pull out the fire blast which
is<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.020> did<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.500> anticipate

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is probably what he did not anticipate

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.270 
is probably what he did not anticipate

Glaceon here I'm like oh god he probably

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.200

is<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> nice<00:01:58.619> move<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.460> he<00:01:59.520> does<00:01:59.670> scare<00:01:59.909> me<00:01:59.969> out

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
is a nice move so he does scare me out

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
is a nice move so he does scare me out
it<00:02:00.329> turns<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.930> Glaceon<00:02:01.469> did<00:02:01.799> not

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it turns out this Glaceon did not

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.840 
it turns out this Glaceon did not
actually<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> nice<00:02:03.000> move

actually have a nice move
so<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.270> bear-like<00:02:04.420> all<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.050> random

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
so this is bear-like all the random

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.110 
so this is bear-like all the random

humans not we're not weak to ice but
they<00:02:25.959> are<00:02:26.080> both<00:02:26.320> me<00:02:26.530> -<00:02:26.709> dragon<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> don't

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
they are both me - dragon so I don't

know<00:02:27.610> what<00:02:27.730> his<00:02:27.820> last<00:02:27.880> Pokemon<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.080> turns

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
know what his last Pokemon is and turns

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.290 
know what his last Pokemon is and turns
out<00:02:29.830> he<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.490> doesn't<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.880> nice<00:02:31.030> move

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
out he actually doesn't have a nice move

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.480 
out he actually doesn't have a nice move
I<00:02:31.600> think<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.350> said<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.560> earlier<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:33.160> anyway

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
I think I said that earlier but anyway

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.970 
I think I said that earlier but anyway
he<00:02:33.970> does<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> wish<00:02:34.810> protect<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.590> think

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
he does have the wish protect I think

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.729 
he does have the wish protect I think
his<00:02:36.130> last<00:02:36.310> move<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.760> hidden<00:02:37.180> power<00:02:37.739> psychic

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
his last move is hidden power psychic

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.440 
his last move is hidden power psychic
and<00:02:39.070> he<00:02:39.160> also<00:02:39.280> has<00:02:39.580> Shadow<00:02:40.090> Ball

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and he also has Shadow Ball

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.750 
and he also has Shadow Ball
so<00:02:41.260> he's<00:02:41.410> gonna<00:02:41.530> get<00:02:41.709> all<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:41.860> stuff<00:02:42.340> back

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
so he's gonna get all that stuff back

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.050 
so he's gonna get all that stuff back
I'm<00:02:42.970> gonna<00:02:43.480> keep<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.840> spam<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.290> Fire<00:02:44.500> Blast

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
eventually though I'm going to realize

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.150 
eventually though I'm going to realize
that<00:02:48.730> I'm<00:02:49.420> running<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.140> Fire<00:02:50.530> Blast<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.100> I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
that I'm running out of Fire Blast and I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.600 
that I'm running out of Fire Blast and I
have<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.489> switch<00:02:51.820> out<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:53.250> I'm<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.430> gonna

think<00:02:56.980> I've<00:02:57.100> realized<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.730> yet

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
think I've realized it yet

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.640 
think I've realized it yet
but<00:02:59.380> anyway<00:03:00.630> he<00:03:01.630> can't<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:01.959> switch<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.590> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
but anyway he can't really switch and I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
but anyway he can't really switch and I
can't<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.130> switch<00:03:03.519> cuz<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:04.330> still<00:03:04.570> don't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
can't really switch cuz we still don't

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.120 
can't really switch cuz we still don't

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
confused this time so that means I have

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.499 
confused this time so that means I have
a<00:04:24.530> choice<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.770> what<00:04:26.070> move<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.460> want<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.820> use<00:04:27.030> I'm

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
a choice of what move I want to use I'm

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.620 
a choice of what move I want to use I'm
going<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:28.110> choose<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:29.039> fusion<00:04:29.850> bolt<00:04:30.090> here<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
going to choose the fusion bolt here and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.580 
going to choose the fusion bolt here and
that's<00:04:30.810> going<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.229> knock<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.699> Glaceon<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:34.320> he

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
that's going to knock out Glaceon so he

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.450 
that's going to knock out Glaceon so he
actually<00:04:35.160> has<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.940> qm<00:04:36.539> of<00:04:36.750> his<00:04:37.020> own<00:04:37.259> here<00:04:37.979> except

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
actually has a qm of his own here except

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.560 
actually has a qm of his own here except
it's<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:39.320> regular<00:04:40.320> it's<00:04:40.889> not<00:04:41.120> black<00:04:42.120> um<00:04:42.389> so

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
it's not regular it's not black um so

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.050 
it's not regular it's not black um so
anyway<00:04:43.009> he<00:04:44.009> actually<00:04:44.280> has<00:04:44.370> speeds<00:04:44.669> me<00:04:44.880> which

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
anyway he actually has speeds me which

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.310 
anyway he actually has speeds me which
is<00:04:45.180> kind<00:04:45.389> of<00:04:45.419> surprising<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.990> thought<00:04:46.169> black

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
is kind of surprising I thought black

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.839 
is kind of surprising I thought black
Hyrum<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.710> faster<00:04:47.070> he<00:04:47.160> has<00:04:47.280> two<00:04:47.460> levels<00:04:47.789> above

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
Hyrum is faster he has two levels above

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.499 
Hyrum is faster he has two levels above
me<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:48.630> don't<00:04:48.810> know<00:04:48.870> again<00:04:49.620> random<00:04:50.160> V's<00:04:51.030> so

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
me so I don't know again random V's so

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.330 
me so I don't know again random V's so
that's<00:04:51.660> how<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.840> predict<00:04:52.199> he<00:04:52.740> does<00:04:52.919> have<00:04:53.070> speed

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
that's how to predict he does have speed
