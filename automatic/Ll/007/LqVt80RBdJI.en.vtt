00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.540
 woerth 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.440
 in the back is so hinge will it takes 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.229
 the experience so far regularly together 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.390
 but he will have to 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.159
 for 100 th 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.850
 a very important and important thing once it's 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.380
 performing 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.320
 and i feel that for less norway even though he detected choy-the-king 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.550
 I find that those of a certain mostly of complementarity I find it is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.640
 players that can be complementary 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 and especially that in construction 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.070
 what is important to me 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.900
 yield carson who offers a few cases that guaranteed 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 we talk about that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.220
 we will try to make these qualities 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.410
 hoping that europe their solidity and their performance of strong kent 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.980
 more and more those who will delight they are complementary and especially of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.350
 more and more they will give a defensive base 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.350
 powerful euros 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.530
 abidal% and then plays in central defense right now 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 she has nothing to play the day before 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 so I was a little bit of seeing barclays post-it war get stabilized 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.630
 as long as it stabilized a post 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 I will see 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030
 play if he's the best at his post 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 best french 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.190
 and if so he will be called 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.520
 as for William I think that good 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.330
 you know what happened it took a while to find another 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.470
 club 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.300
 I do not think it's in the best physical arrangements 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.180
 how why 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.470
 for proof these two games but very important what matters 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.969
 as I tell you% there are six drawings on two two trades on 12 shots 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.870
 % I think for my particular sense the home game I hope he's going 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.860
 must attack and who will score goals 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.680
 even a regime as well as any attackers or offensive players who 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.220
 score goals 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.070
 so that we can find a defensive base we want all conflicts 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.479
 trust players 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.499
 give themselves the opportunity to start and to a possible injury 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.139
 but I believe as I repeat during the match there are players who 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.069
 are able 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.129
 eventually 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.459
 that a fine of 2 to occupy posts 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.459
 so that helps 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.879
 to double the positions at 5am in art classes practically alone in front of the goal 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.319
 knowing that on both matches 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.329
 unfortunately those who will double others in the stands 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.409
 it's not the best way to prepare for the season 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.889
 especially since I consider that 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.579
 at this beginning of the season it is perhaps more important to work well with 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.519
 his club to become much more competitive 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.449
 for those who are not here for the month of October
