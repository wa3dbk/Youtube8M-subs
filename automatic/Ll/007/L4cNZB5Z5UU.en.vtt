and you might use it so it the answer
it's<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:19.530> questions<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.220> answerable

it is it is it depends on what happens
in<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.240> future<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.840> how<00:02:24.930> well<00:02:25.440> things<00:02:25.770> move

into a development stage and see if
something<00:02:31.950> might<00:02:32.130> be<00:02:32.310> useful<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
something might be useful as was the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.160 
something might be useful as was the
case<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.140> unmanned<00:02:34.560> aerial<00:02:34.770> vehicles<00:02:36.170> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
case with the unmanned aerial vehicles I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.350 
case with the unmanned aerial vehicles I
think<00:02:37.890> that's<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> point<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:38.940> think<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
think that's the point and I think and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.000 
think that's the point and I think and
it's<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.620> beginning<00:02:40.950> of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
it's we have I think from beginning of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.230 
it's we have I think from beginning of
this<00:02:41.130> conflict<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.760> general<00:02:41.970> Frank's

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
this conflict I think general Frank's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.350 
this conflict I think general Frank's
has<00:02:42.360> been<00:02:42.510> very<00:02:42.780> open<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.440> looking<00:02:44.340> at<00:02:44.490> new

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
has been very open to looking at new

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940 
has been very open to looking at new
things<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.410> new<00:02:46.500> things<00:02:46.680> available

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
things if there are new things available

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
things if there are new things available
and<00:02:47.370> has<00:02:47.970> been<00:02:48.180> been<00:02:49.020> willing<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> put<00:02:49.590> them

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and has been been willing to put them

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.290 
and has been been willing to put them
into<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.070> fight<00:02:50.250> even<00:02:50.760> before<00:02:50.880> they<00:02:51.120> didn't

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
into the fight even before they didn't

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.600 
into the fight even before they didn't
fully<00:02:51.390> run<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.739> think<00:02:52.800> that's<00:02:53.100> not

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
fully run out and I think that's not

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
becoming real there are several types of

becoming real there are several types of
directed<00:03:39.780> energy<00:03:39.959> weapons<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.920> basically

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
directed energy weapons and basically

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.090 
directed energy weapons and basically
what<00:03:42.209> they<00:03:42.360> do<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.989> they're<00:03:43.260> known<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.680> speed

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
what they do is they're known as speed

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
what they do is they're known as speed
of<00:03:44.280> light<00:03:44.489> because<00:03:45.030> they<00:03:45.209> shoot<00:03:45.480> electrons

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
then there's microwave weapons that are

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.040 
then there's microwave weapons that are

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.350 
operating at other frequencies but
