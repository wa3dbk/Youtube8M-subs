the<00:00:06.630> treatment<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.350> colon<00:00:07.799> cancer<00:00:08.280> really

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the treatment of colon cancer really

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.610 
the treatment of colon cancer really
depends<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> stage<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> colon<00:00:10.590> cancer

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
depends on the stage of the colon cancer

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.950 
depends on the stage of the colon cancer
colon<00:00:11.550> cancer<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.090> divided<00:00:12.570> into<00:00:12.720> four

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
colon cancer is divided into four

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.060 
colon cancer is divided into four
different<00:00:13.320> stages

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
different stages

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.359 
different stages
Stage<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.460> would<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.809> small<00:00:16.320> colon<00:00:16.890> cancer

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
Stage one would be a small colon cancer

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
Stage one would be a small colon cancer
that's<00:00:17.640> really<00:00:18.420> localized<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> lining<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that's really localized to the lining of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
that's really localized to the lining of
the<00:00:20.010> colon<00:00:20.340> doesn't<00:00:21.240> involve<00:00:21.510> any<00:00:21.690> nodal

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the colon doesn't involve any nodal

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
the colon doesn't involve any nodal
involvement<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.340> would<00:00:23.490> particularly

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
involvement and that would particularly

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.420 
involvement and that would particularly
be<00:00:24.449> fine<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.350> surgical<00:00:25.800> resection<00:00:26.100> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
be fine which a surgical resection and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.429 
be fine which a surgical resection and
those<00:00:26.580> patients<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> great<00:00:27.510> outcome<00:00:27.930> with

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
those patients have a great outcome with

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.999 
those patients have a great outcome with
just<00:00:28.650> surgery<00:00:29.010> alone<00:00:29.390> stage<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
just surgery alone stage two is when the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.739 
just surgery alone stage two is when the
tumor<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.429> a<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.669> bigger<00:00:32.879> it's<00:00:33.120> invaded<00:00:33.600> into

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:33.749 
tumor is a bit bigger it's invaded into

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.009 
tumor is a bit bigger it's invaded into
the<00:00:33.989> muscle<00:00:34.469> or<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.999> still<00:00:36.359> there<00:00:36.989> are

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
the muscle or more but still there are

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.649 
the muscle or more but still there are
no<00:00:37.289> lymph<00:00:37.559> nodes<00:00:37.769> that<00:00:37.949> are<00:00:38.010> positive<00:00:38.609> now<00:00:39.269> for

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659 
no lymph nodes that are positive now for

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.259 
no lymph nodes that are positive now for
stage<00:00:39.960> 3<00:00:39.989> patients<00:00:40.710> those<00:00:41.549> patients

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
stage 3 patients those patients

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.660 
stage 3 patients those patients
basically<00:00:42.659> have<00:00:43.229> nodal<00:00:43.859> involvement<00:00:43.979> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
basically have nodal involvement of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.809 
basically have nodal involvement of
their<00:00:44.850> cancer<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.600> those<00:00:46.260> patients<00:00:47.010> benefit

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
their cancer so those patients benefit

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.629 
their cancer so those patients benefit
from<00:00:47.879> surgical<00:00:48.359> resection<00:00:48.959> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> tumor

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:49.639 
from surgical resection of the tumor

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.549 
from surgical resection of the tumor
followed<00:00:50.639> by<00:00:50.819> six<00:00:51.089> months<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.479> chemotherapy

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
followed by six months of chemotherapy

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
followed by six months of chemotherapy
and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.129> goal<00:00:53.369> there<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.999> so<00:00:54.269> that<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.569> can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and the goal there is so that we can

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.379 
and the goal there is so that we can
treat<00:00:55.489> micrometastatic<00:00:56.489> disease<00:00:56.519> meaning

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:57.389 
treat micrometastatic disease meaning

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.389 
treat micrometastatic disease meaning
that<00:00:57.629> small<00:00:58.350> cancer<00:00:58.769> cells<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.309> either

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that small cancer cells that are either

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
that small cancer cells that are either
in<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.729> bloodstream<00:01:00.119> or<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> lymphatics<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
in the bloodstream or the lymphatics so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
in the bloodstream or the lymphatics so
that<00:01:01.529> we<00:01:01.619> can<00:01:01.799> reduce<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.279> risk<00:01:02.459> of<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that we can reduce the risk of a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.639 
that we can reduce the risk of a
recurrence<00:01:02.839> in<00:01:03.839> stage<00:01:04.589> four<00:01:05.009> is<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.969> the

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
recurrence in stage four is when the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.819 
recurrence in stage four is when the
tumor<00:01:07.649> has<00:01:08.100> spread<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:09.450> another<00:01:09.869> site<00:01:10.469> like

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
tumor has spread to another site like

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.459 
tumor has spread to another site like
the<00:01:11.009> liver<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.609> the<00:01:11.670> lung<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.899> even<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.350> those

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
the liver or the lung but even in those

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.190 
the liver or the lung but even in those
patients<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.250> used<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.579> say<00:01:14.789> this<00:01:15.000> was

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
patients we used to say this was

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.599 
patients we used to say this was
incurable<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.469> we<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.859> found<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.429> we've

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
incurable and we have found that we've

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.940

could<00:01:53.870> potentially<00:01:54.560> get<00:01:54.680> injured<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.670> that's

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
could potentially get injured so that's

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.060 
could potentially get injured so that's
why<00:01:56.150> it's<00:01:56.630> really<00:01:56.750> important<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.890> have

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
why it's really important to have

where<00:02:05.270> there's<00:02:05.780> minimal<00:02:06.260> effect<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:06.950> any

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
where there's minimal effect on any

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.729 
where there's minimal effect on any
surrounding<00:02:07.640> structures<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.630> think<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.709> of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
surrounding structures I think some of

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.040 
surrounding structures I think some of
the<00:02:09.920> most<00:02:10.610> exciting<00:02:10.880> things<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the most exciting things are the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.920 
the most exciting things are the
minimally<00:02:12.440> invasive<00:02:12.890> techniques<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.750> do

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
minimally invasive techniques so we do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.740 
minimally invasive techniques so we do
most<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.290> our<00:02:15.470> operations<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.940> laparoscopy

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
most of our operations with laparoscopy

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.720 
most of our operations with laparoscopy
meaning<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.739> small<00:02:19.190> incisions

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
meaning that you get small incisions

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.390 
meaning that you get small incisions
instead<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.209> big<00:02:20.510> long<00:02:20.750> incision<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.470> we

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
instead of a big long incision and we

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.699 
instead of a big long incision and we
can<00:02:22.550> see<00:02:22.820> up<00:02:23.090> close<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.930> ways<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.620> we

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
can see up close in ways that we

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.650 
can see up close in ways that we
couldn't<00:02:24.920> before<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.850> other<00:02:26.030> big

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
couldn't before the other big

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.690 
couldn't before the other big
development<00:02:26.810> recently<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:28.010> pelvic<00:02:28.520> surgery

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
development recently in pelvic surgery

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
development recently in pelvic surgery
so<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.300> rectal<00:02:29.690> cancers<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.290> robotic<00:02:31.160> surgery

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
so for rectal cancers is robotic surgery

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.340 
so for rectal cancers is robotic surgery
and<00:02:31.790> that's<00:02:32.239> been<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.660> exciting<00:02:33.110> too

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
and that's been really exciting too

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.800 
and that's been really exciting too
because<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.640> minimizes<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.420> size<00:02:35.660> of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
because it really minimizes the size of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.140 
because it really minimizes the size of
the<00:02:35.930> incisions<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:37.070> reduces<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.790> length<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the incisions it reduces the length of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.510 
the incisions it reduces the length of
stay<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> hospital<00:02:39.020> after<00:02:39.680> surgery<00:02:40.010> and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
stay in the hospital after surgery and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.110 
stay in the hospital after surgery and
also<00:02:40.940> there's<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> good<00:02:41.299> cosmetic<00:02:41.510> outcome

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
also there's a good cosmetic outcome

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.699 
also there's a good cosmetic outcome
after<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.330> cancer<00:02:44.870> surgeon<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.320> done<00:02:45.530> with

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
after the cancer surgeon is done with

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.009 
after the cancer surgeon is done with
removing<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> tumor<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:47.360> end<00:02:47.570> up<00:02:47.690> having<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
removing the tumor you end up having a

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.740 
removing the tumor you end up having a
space<00:02:48.350> within<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.700> area<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.420> tumor

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
space within that area that the tumor

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.620 
space within that area that the tumor
was<00:02:50.870> occupying<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:53.000> has<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.239> be<00:02:53.330> filled

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
was occupying and that has to be filled

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.380 
was occupying and that has to be filled
with<00:02:54.549> something<00:02:55.549> that's<00:02:56.120> where

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
with something that's where

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.090 
with something that's where
reconstructive<00:02:57.320> plastic<00:02:57.440> surgeon<00:02:57.980> would

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
reconstructive plastic surgeon would

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.160 
reconstructive plastic surgeon would
come<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.549> do<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.880> we<00:02:59.630> try<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.049> take

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
come in to do that we try and take

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.840 
come in to do that we try and take
tissue<00:03:00.440> from<00:03:00.680> another<00:03:00.950> part<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.310> body<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
tissue from another part of the body and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.320 
tissue from another part of the body and
move<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.989> into<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.680> space<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.790> help<00:03:04.940> fill

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
move it into that space to help fill

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.360 
move it into that space to help fill
that<00:03:05.540> space<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.530> help<00:03:06.709> prevent<00:03:07.070> that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
that space to help prevent that

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.460 
that space to help prevent that
gravitational<00:03:08.000> dependent<00:03:08.900> fall<00:03:09.230> that

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
gravitational dependent fall that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.949 
gravitational dependent fall that
happens<00:03:09.890> inside<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.489> belly

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.170 

as<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.829> patient<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.340> think<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.670> would<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.939> a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
as a patient I think it would be a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.890 
as a patient I think it would be a
really<00:03:15.599> great<00:03:16.489> cohesive<00:03:17.489> experience<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.750> be

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
really great cohesive experience to be

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.660 
really great cohesive experience to be
seen<00:03:19.170> at<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> Stanford<00:03:19.920> Cancer<00:03:20.040> Center<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
seen at the Stanford Cancer Center and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.910 
seen at the Stanford Cancer Center and
that's<00:03:21.060> because<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.439> benefit<00:03:22.890> of

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that's because we have the benefit of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
that's because we have the benefit of
the<00:03:23.010> tumor<00:03:23.370> board<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.909> this<00:03:24.090> tumor<00:03:24.659> board<00:03:24.870> is

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
the tumor board and this tumor board is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.140 
the tumor board and this tumor board is
a<00:03:24.989> multidisciplinary<00:03:25.879> meeting<00:03:26.879> where<00:03:27.120> we

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
a multidisciplinary meeting where we

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.599 
a multidisciplinary meeting where we
have<00:03:27.480> medical<00:03:28.290> oncologists<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:29.159> we<00:03:29.400> have

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
have medical oncologists and we have

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.940 
have medical oncologists and we have
colorectal<00:03:30.060> surgeons<00:03:30.750> we<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.260> liver

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
colorectal surgeons we have liver

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.970 
colorectal surgeons we have liver
surgeons<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:33.230> thoracic<00:03:34.230> surgeons<00:03:34.709> then

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
surgeons we have thoracic surgeons then

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.390 
surgeons we have thoracic surgeons then
we<00:03:35.099> have<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.840> pathologists<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
we have the pathologists the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.460 
we have the pathologists the
radiologists<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.629> nurses<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:40.079> everyone's

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
radiologists and nurses and everyone's

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.140 
radiologists and nurses and everyone's
talking<00:03:40.680> about<00:03:40.920> okay<00:03:41.489> what's<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.969> best

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
talking about okay what's the best

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.839 
talking about okay what's the best
approach<00:03:42.299> for<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:43.319> person<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:44.579> try<00:03:44.819> to

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
approach for this person and we try to

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.020 
approach for this person and we try to
come<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.239> with<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.659> really<00:03:46.379> good<00:03:47.099> comprehensive

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
come up with a really good comprehensive

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.589 
come up with a really good comprehensive
and<00:03:48.209> holistic<00:03:48.859> plan<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.730> everyone<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.269> at

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
and holistic plan I think everyone is at

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.920 
and holistic plan I think everyone is at
the<00:03:51.810> top<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.049> their<00:03:52.260> field<00:03:52.590> here<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.810> we<00:03:54.810> all

the top of their field here and we all

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.319 
the top of their field here and we all
collaborate<00:03:55.439> well<00:03:55.620> together<00:03:55.829> we've<00:03:56.700> had<00:03:56.909> many

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
collaborate well together we've had many

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.270 
collaborate well together we've had many
patients<00:03:57.840> who<00:03:58.079> show<00:03:58.859> up<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.069> our<00:03:59.159> doorstep

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
patients who show up on our doorstep

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.360 
patients who show up on our doorstep
that<00:03:59.849> have<00:04:00.120> had<00:04:00.659> tumors<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.620> were<00:04:02.129> deemed

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
that have had tumors that were deemed

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.589 
that have had tumors that were deemed
either<00:04:02.730> unresectable<00:04:03.269> previously<00:04:04.230> or<00:04:04.939> were<00:04:05.939> a

either unresectable previously or were a

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.330 
either unresectable previously or were a
lost<00:04:07.470> cause<00:04:07.799> in<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.159> past<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:09.379> we've<00:04:10.379> managed

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
lost cause in the past and we've managed
