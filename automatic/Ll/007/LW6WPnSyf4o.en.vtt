option so you know in business there's
some<00:01:22.940> things<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.360> are<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.630> beyond<00:01:24.020> your

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
some things that are just beyond your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.770 
some things that are just beyond your
control<00:01:24.580> you're<00:01:25.580> dealing<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.150> employees

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
control you're dealing with employees

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.590 
control you're dealing with employees
you're<00:01:27.560> dealing<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:27.950> outside<00:01:28.520> forces<00:01:29.450> that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
you're dealing with outside forces that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.870 
you're dealing with outside forces that
sometimes<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.470> just<00:01:30.500> can't<00:01:31.340> really<00:01:31.610> do

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
sometimes you just can't really do

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.700 
sometimes you just can't really do
anything<00:01:32.090> about<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.690> that's<00:01:33.170> one<00:01:33.440> thing

anything about and that's one thing
that's<00:01:34.070> very<00:01:34.400> difficult<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:35.060> me<00:01:35.180> because<00:01:35.330> you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
that's very difficult for me because you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.200 
that's very difficult for me because you
know<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:35.960> go<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:36.710> something<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.400> go<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.940> win

I<00:01:38.540> go<00:01:38.990> not<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.350> fail<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.790> when<00:01:41.119> things<00:01:41.360> do

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
I go not to fail and when things do

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.570 
I go not to fail and when things do
happen<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:42.500> not<00:01:42.680> really<00:01:43.040> what<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.310> want
