00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
right this is the fake Samsung memory

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.590 
right this is the fake Samsung memory
card<00:00:04.380> I've<00:00:04.560> got<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:05.370> see<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> package<00:00:06.120> it's<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
card I've got you see the package it's a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.209 
card I've got you see the package it's a
Samsung<00:00:06.980> micro-sd<00:00:07.980> HC<00:00:08.780> card<00:00:09.780> design<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.769> class

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
Samsung micro-sd HC card design so class

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.450 
Samsung micro-sd HC card design so class
10<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.230> then<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> package<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
10 and then this is the package of it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.120 
10 and then this is the package of it
already<00:00:14.790> open<00:00:15.240> it

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
already open it

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.450 
already open it
so<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.859> 64<00:00:19.859> gigabyte

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so first is that this is a 64 gigabyte

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
so first is that this is a 64 gigabyte
card<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.420> thought<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.380> mentioned

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
card that I thought but it mentioned

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
card that I thought but it mentioned
that<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.580> micro<00:00:24.119> SD<00:00:24.660> s<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:26.060> HC<00:00:27.060> card<00:00:27.359> in

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that this is a micro SD s a HC card in

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.730 
that this is a micro SD s a HC card in
64<00:00:29.010> gigabyte<00:00:29.550> actually<00:00:30.210> older<00:00:30.660> Samsung<00:00:31.230> haha

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
64 gigabyte actually older Samsung haha

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.740 
64 gigabyte actually older Samsung haha

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
gigabyte SD HC you can see that actually

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.869 
gigabyte SD HC you can see that actually
all<00:00:52.920> Samsung<00:00:53.309> 64<00:00:53.730> gigabyte<00:00:54.600> card<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.680> X<00:00:56.010> C

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
all Samsung 64 gigabyte card as the X C

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
all Samsung 64 gigabyte card as the X C
and<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> class<00:00:58.739> 10<00:00:59.070> symbol<00:00:59.550> next

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and you can see the class 10 symbol next

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.380 
and you can see the class 10 symbol next
to<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> wonder<00:01:02.579> board<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.210> also

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to it in in the wonder board it also

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.700 
to it in in the wonder board it also
comes<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:05.240> with<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> micro<00:01:07.350> SD<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:09.350> SD<00:01:10.350> adapter

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
comes with with a micro SD to SD adapter

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
comes with with a micro SD to SD adapter
we<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.670> say<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.330> from<00:01:12.540> Samsung<00:01:12.860> okay<00:01:14.000> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
we also say that is from Samsung okay so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480 
we also say that is from Samsung okay so
this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> package<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this is the package at the back of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.810 
this is the package at the back of the
package<00:01:18.530> they<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.770> different<00:01:20.400> memory

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
package they have a different memory

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
package they have a different memory
concise<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> volume<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
concise and what is the volume that you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
concise and what is the volume that you
can<00:01:24.030> hold<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.479> doesn't<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.960> his<00:01:25.159> 64

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
can hold it doesn't have his 64

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.609 
can hold it doesn't have his 64
gigabytes<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.180> another<00:01:27.509> clue<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
gigabytes so that is another clue to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
gigabytes so that is another clue to
tell<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.990> fake

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
tell you that this is a this is a fake

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.609 
tell you that this is a this is a fake
car<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.790> true<00:01:33.090> Samsung<00:01:34.079> 64

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
car this is not a true Samsung 64

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
car this is not a true Samsung 64
gigabyte<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.820> well<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.229> look<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gigabyte on well but just look at the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
gigabyte on well but just look at the
card<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.549> much<00:01:38.729> memory<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
card we don't know how much memory that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
card we don't know how much memory that
he<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:39.750> holds<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.100> for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
he actually holds we will need to go for

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
he actually holds we will need to go for
a<00:01:41.400> software<00:01:41.880> test<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> what

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
a software test to see that what

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.340 
a software test to see that what
actually<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:44.640> available<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> 64

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
actually is available in this 64

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.209 
actually is available in this 64
