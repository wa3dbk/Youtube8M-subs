00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.180 

so<00:00:02.080> what<00:00:02.200> we<00:00:02.290> do<00:00:02.409> is<00:00:02.530> we<00:00:02.620> pull<00:00:02.800> this<00:00:02.889> little

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.190 
so what we do is we pull this little

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.220 
so what we do is we pull this little
vacuum<00:00:03.520> hose<00:00:03.670> off

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.460 

and<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.680> stupid

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:20.200 

this<00:00:12.950> goes<00:00:13.130> on

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.620 

I<00:00:20.300> try<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.019> get<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.199> rag<00:00:22.269> trying<00:00:23.269> to<00:00:23.359> stop<00:00:23.539> it

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
I try and get a rag trying to stop it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.130 
I try and get a rag trying to stop it
from<00:00:23.750> coming<00:00:23.929> out<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:24.529> go<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.220> spray<00:00:25.579> a<00:00:26.140> little

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
from coming out and go to spray a little

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.580 
from coming out and go to spray a little
bit<00:00:27.289> of<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.470> time<00:00:28.929> so<00:00:29.929> you<00:00:29.989> need<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.349> try<00:00:30.529> and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
bit of the time so you need to try and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.619 
bit of the time so you need to try and
get<00:00:30.800> about<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:32.739> third<00:00:33.739> of<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:35.059> spray<00:00:35.360> can

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
get about a third of the spray can

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:48.579 
get about a third of the spray can
inside<00:00:36.079> your<00:00:36.470> manifold

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.889 

so<00:00:49.589> what<00:00:49.769> this<00:00:49.890> does<00:00:49.949> is<00:00:50.429> it<00:00:50.940> helps<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> remove

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so what this does is it helps to remove

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.770 
so what this does is it helps to remove
the<00:00:52.170> carbon<00:00:52.710> buildup<00:00:53.190> inside<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:54.179> manifold

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.870 

it's<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.620> we're<00:01:01.740> going<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> next<00:01:02.160> doing

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's what we're going to do next doing

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.330 
it's what we're going to do next doing
on<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.000> stop<00:01:03.480> engine<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.620> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> spray<00:01:05.160> the

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
on a stop engine I'm going to spray the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
on a stop engine I'm going to spray the
rest<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> in

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:39.570 

that's<00:01:27.780> normal<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.620> here<00:01:28.890> sucking<00:01:29.310> sound

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.820 

it<00:01:40.090> would<00:01:40.210> be<00:01:40.330> easy<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.110> had<00:01:41.260> someone<00:01:41.530> to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
it would be easy if you had someone to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:57.480 
it would be easy if you had someone to
wrap<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.190> engine

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.749 

and<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.060> I'll<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:58.210> spray<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.780> rest<00:01:58.900> down

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.609 

every<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.570> often<00:02:02.750> I'll<00:02:02.960> give<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.229> engineer

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
every so often I'll give you engineer

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.279 
every so often I'll give you engineer
rev<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.579> what<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.880> want<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.750> want<00:02:05.780> white

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
rev and what you want is you want white

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:27.920 
rev and what you want is you want white
smoke<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:07.189> come<00:02:07.369> out<00:02:07.549> your<00:02:07.759> exhaust

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.990 

but<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.950> spray<00:02:29.219> it<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.519> in

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
but just spray it all in

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.230 
but just spray it all in
the<00:02:31.420> vacuum<00:02:31.810> sucks<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.650> now<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.760> much

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
the vacuum sucks it in now so it's much

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.780 
the vacuum sucks it in now so it's much
easier<00:02:34.270> when<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> engines<00:02:35.170> running

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.569 

spray<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.599> whole<00:02:40.719> canon<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.099> one-time

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
spray the whole canon it's a one-time

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:51.040 
spray the whole canon it's a one-time
one<00:02:42.849> use

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.890 

so<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.650> reason<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.430> first<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:53.600> that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
so the reason we do this first is that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.680 
so the reason we do this first is that
some<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.620> contents<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:56.000> go<00:02:56.360> into

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
some of the contents of this can go into

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.380 
some of the contents of this can go into
the<00:02:56.960> engine<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:58.130> straight<00:02:58.610> after<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.180> this

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
the engine so straight after you do this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.750 
the engine so straight after you do this
you<00:02:59.690> want<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.960> drop<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.440> oil<00:03:00.710> out<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:01.580> get

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
you want to drop the oil out so you get

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.670 
you want to drop the oil out so you get
rid<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.180> old<00:03:02.390> oil<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.320> get<00:03:03.500> rid<00:03:03.650> of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
rid of the old oil and you get rid of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.820 
rid of the old oil and you get rid of
any<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> contaminants<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.410> that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
any of the contaminants of this can that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.330 
any of the contaminants of this can that
will<00:03:07.340> make<00:03:07.610> its<00:03:07.820> way<00:03:07.880> into<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.510> oil<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.830> do

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
will make its way into the oil so do

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:27.970 
will make its way into the oil so do
this<00:03:10.520> first<00:03:10.820> don't<00:03:11.450> do<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> last

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.280 

those<00:03:28.520> are<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.879> last<00:03:29.120> one<00:03:29.360> almost<00:03:29.900> finished

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
those are the last one almost finished

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.350 
those are the last one almost finished
the<00:03:30.410> camp

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.840 

so<00:03:38.110> take<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.410> hose<00:03:38.560> off<00:03:38.800> put<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> original

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
so take the hose off put the original

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.760 
so take the hose off put the original
one<00:03:40.180> back<00:03:40.420> on

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
one back on

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.820 
one back on
and<00:03:42.130> we're<00:03:42.280> ready<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.550> continue
