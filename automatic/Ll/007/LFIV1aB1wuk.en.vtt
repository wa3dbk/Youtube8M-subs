cruise<00:04:46.590> control<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:50.300> sunroof<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:52.110> just<00:04:52.800> to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
cruise control and sunroof so just to

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.290 
cruise control and sunroof so just to
show<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.580> operational<00:04:54.180> or

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
show you that this is operational or

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800 
show you that this is operational or
works<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.340> it's<00:04:56.700> actually<00:04:56.850> that's<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.570> sunroof

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
works so it's actually that's a sunroof

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.360 
works so it's actually that's a sunroof
so<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.320> difference<00:04:58.560> between<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.860> sunroof<00:04:59.280> and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
so the difference between a sunroof and

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.810 
so the difference between a sunroof and
a<00:04:59.430> moonroof<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.780> sunroof<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:02.580> not

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
a moonroof is the sunroof is this not

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.180 
a moonroof is the sunroof is this not
has<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> cover<00:05:03.690> on<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.870> whereas<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.470> moonroof<00:05:04.980> has

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
has a cover on it whereas a moonroof has

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.150 
has a cover on it whereas a moonroof has
got<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:05.850> open<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.710> I'm<00:05:07.770> gonna<00:05:07.860> open<00:05:08.100> that
