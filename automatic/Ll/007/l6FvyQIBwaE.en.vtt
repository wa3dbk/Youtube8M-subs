00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.019
 hi to all your kids in there 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
 this new video we will see the unboxing 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.420
 of the noise blockers b12 4 of the fans 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.730
 black noise fans are a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 tribute of the black noise I thank 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.940
 find the link to the site and the page 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.440
 facebook of registration 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.510
 I highly recommend you check it out and if 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.840
 you want nice let me like it there 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 soon we catch up with the unboxing well 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 guys here we are with the box containing 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 the fan 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 all around we have as always various 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.030
 images and information 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.590
 in the back we have various 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 technical specifications in various languages 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 while in the front part in addition to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.140
 other specifications we can see 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.790
 the image of the fan 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.790
 let's move on to boxing now 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.850
 inside we find various screws and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.879
 mounting spacers 2 extensions 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.879
 one of 200 mm and one of 500 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.860
 and to finish the fan obviously 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.390
 let's see some specific dimensions 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.510
 height 120 mm width 120 thickness 25 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.150
 I think 123 grams connection with 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.600
 corrector 3-pin starting voltage 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.870
 3.3 volt maximum 12 volt voltage 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.050
 maximum number of revolutions per minute 2,400 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.810
 air flow 153 cubic meters per hour 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.640
 guarantees of six years in the part 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 front we can see the four 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.170
 corners 4 rubber pads to cushion the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.450
 vibrations and in the center the fan with the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 its particular form called bionic 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 fan loops in the corner of the frame we have 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.640
 the three pine connector to power the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.560
 fan 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.650
 as you see very short so we will have to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.270
 use 200 and 500 mm extensions 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.369
 included in the package 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.950
 while in the back we have the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.010
 frame that holds the motor also this a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.200
 this particular undulating shape is 4 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.790
 corners we also have 4 combinations here 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 integrated to cushion vibrations 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.140
 what can we say about this pot 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.239
 in addition to its particular shape e 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.660
 design that makes it in my opinion very much 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.370
 beautiful and eye-catching the e-loop of 12 4 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.370
 also offers benefits 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.310
 exceptional the b12 4 and the one with the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 rpm rpm higher than the series 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.040
 b 12 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.920
 this makes it therefore particularly 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 performing at 2,400 rpm 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 noise with speeds up to 75 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 percent is quite contained if that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.630
 for example it goes down to 50 percent 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.150
 About 1200 rpm the fan is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.370
 really silent almost inaudible point 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.380
 vice versa one hundred percent case 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.060
 rather unusual unless you do 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.440
 head details that require a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 airflow the higher it is 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.060
 possible for example overclock for 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.820
 benchmark the fan is rather 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.799
 noisy but offering the same time 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.290
 a truly impressive air flow 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.030
 I tried them on the iraq 80 i run 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.860
 temperatures with the fans at the same 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.840
 speed of those stops are you 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.239
 then lower by about 3 degrees then 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.640
 pretty good I had to check the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.320
 fans via a fan controller having 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 this event as already mentioned on 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.260
 connector 3 pings exist in each case 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.200
 of the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.569
 the twelve pvm then 4-pin and le 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.090
 performance at least on paper, yes 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.280
 deviate much from abi 12 4 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.459
 unfortunately there are no others in the elop 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.409
 size but only 120 mm would be 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.970
 very interesting in my opinion can 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.739
 try a pan of size 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.019
 major with this particular design 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.519
 but fortunately I know what size 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.409
 more are in progress 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.260
 so it's just a matter of time 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.840
 good guys and the unboxing of the loop v12 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.670
 4 ends here you find it online at a 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.560
 price of around 19 euros 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.659
 I want to thank black again 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.000
 noise for the tribute find the link to 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.950
 site on the Facebook description page

 I recommend you take a look and if 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.700
 you want to leave a nice one I like I hope

 useful tips on the world 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.340
 of unboxing computing always 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 commented and blog I recommend you follow 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.199
