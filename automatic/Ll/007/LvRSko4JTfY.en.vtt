that's the Raven Raven and then the palm
and<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> pronto<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> first<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> yep

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

what<00:01:37.079> reasons<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
what reasons probably are one of the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.200 
what reasons probably are one of the
best<00:01:38.939> selling<00:01:39.180> tools<00:01:40.189> but<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:42.000> out

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
best selling tools but that that was out

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
best selling tools but that that was out
about<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> year<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> half<00:01:43.110> before<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
about a year and a half before the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
about a year and a half before the
piranhas<00:01:44.159> piranhas<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> one

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
piranhas piranhas right now is that one

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
piranhas piranhas right now is that one
probably<00:01:46.229> number<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> say

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
probably number one what would you say

is<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> difference<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:50.250> digging<00:01:50.490> tools

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
is the difference in your digging tools

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.200 
is the difference in your digging tools

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.200 
the sharpness of this if you want a tool
that's<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> cut<00:02:09.550> through<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.910> ground

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
that's going to cut through the ground

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's going to cut through the ground
this<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> tool<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.220> if

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
this is the tool it's going to do it if

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.270 
this is the tool it's going to do it if
you<00:02:12.940> notice<00:02:13.240> how<00:02:13.420> flat<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.050> blade<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.620> it's

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you notice how flat that blade is it's

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160 
you notice how flat that blade is it's
less<00:02:15.550> resistance<00:02:16.270> all<00:02:16.540> you're<00:02:16.780> doing<00:02:17.050> is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
less resistance all you're doing is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.590 
less resistance all you're doing is
pushing<00:02:17.440> into<00:02:17.950> weight<00:02:18.190> itself<00:02:18.640> into<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
pushing into weight itself into the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.720 
pushing into weight itself into the
ground<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.080> thickness<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.770> blade<00:02:20.890> not

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
ground the thickness of the blade not

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.640 
ground the thickness of the blade not
having<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.330> kinds<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.810> different<00:02:22.990> shapes<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
having all kinds of different shapes and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
having all kinds of different shapes and
stuff<00:02:24.240> look<00:02:25.240> at<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.390> way<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.920> individual

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
stuff look at the way this individual

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.770 
stuff look at the way this individual
the<00:02:27.220> front<00:02:27.490> part<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> raven<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> same

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the front part of the raven is the same

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.040 
the front part of the raven is the same
deal<00:02:29.050> it's<00:02:29.440> rounded<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.670> cup<00:02:30.880> steel<00:02:31.270> but

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
deal it's rounded it's a cup steel but

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.350 
deal it's rounded it's a cup steel but
what<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.350> does<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.430> nice<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.030> straight

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
what that does it's nice and straight

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.140 
what that does it's nice and straight
and<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.440> goes<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.980> until<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.490> get<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:37.000> to

and it goes in until you get about up to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.300 
and it goes in until you get about up to
that<00:02:37.330> point<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.960> then<00:02:38.440> once<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.830> go<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.160> and

you got pulled out of the ground it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.240 
you got pulled out of the ground it
slides<00:02:41.050> right<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.410> out<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.830> ground

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
slides right on out of the ground

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.450 
slides right on out of the ground
nice<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.150> easy<00:02:43.920> awesome<00:02:44.920> well<00:02:45.040> George<00:02:45.280> I
