important to have a good foundation in

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
important to have a good foundation in
science<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> math<00:00:17.550> especially<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.600> go<00:00:19.350> into

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
science and math especially to go into

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.580 
science and math especially to go into
engineering<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.990> consider<00:00:22.529> what

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
engineering and just consider what

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.800 
engineering and just consider what
schools<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> think<00:00:24.600> about

science<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.820> math<00:01:08.939> courses<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.720> always

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
science and math courses are always

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.359 
science and math courses are always
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.350> important<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.340> are

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
going to be very important but so are

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
going to be very important but so are
your<00:01:11.549> communication<00:01:12.119> skills<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.720> things

and design things and there are a lot of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.230 
and design things and there are a lot of
programs<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.850> FIRST<00:01:27.180> LEGO

mentioned for high school students and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
mentioned for high school students and
there<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.380> many<00:01:31.409> many<00:01:31.680> more<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> come

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
there are many many more that have come

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
there are many many more that have come
you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> through<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> probably<00:01:34.110> don't

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you know through that I probably don't

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
you know through that I probably don't
even<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.970> imagine<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
even know about now but I imagine if you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
even know about now but I imagine if you
talk<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> science<00:01:37.439> teachers<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> things<00:01:38.100> like

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
talk to science teachers and things like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
talk to science teachers and things like
that<00:01:38.280> you'll<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.820> able<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> find<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.390> what's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that you'll be able to find out what's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
that you'll be able to find out what's
available<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.020> schools<00:01:40.759> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
available at your schools but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.160 
available at your schools but
participating<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> those<00:01:42.780> types<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
participating in those types of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.380 
participating in those types of
challenges<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.850> key<00:01:45.030> building

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
challenges are I think a key building

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
challenges are I think a key building
block<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.860> learning<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.340> takes

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
block to you know learning what it takes

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.039 
block to you know learning what it takes
to<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> scientist<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:48.990> engineer

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to kind of be a scientist or an engineer

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
to kind of be a scientist or an engineer
and<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.340> entails<00:01:50.640> whether<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and what that all entails whether it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.210 
and what that all entails whether it's
for<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.630> whether<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
for you or whether it's not for you it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
for you or whether it's not for you it's
nice<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> figure<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.329> early<00:01:54.930> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
nice to kind of figure that out early on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.990 
nice to kind of figure that out early on
as<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> gives<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> big<00:01:56.640> leg<00:01:56.820> up

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
as well and it gives you a big leg up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
as well and it gives you a big leg up
moving<00:01:57.780> forward<00:01:58.200> through<00:01:58.890> high<00:01:59.280> school<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
moving forward through high school and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
moving forward through high school and
through<00:01:59.820> college<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.840> your<00:02:00.960> career<00:02:01.259> when

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
through college and to your career when

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.440 
through college and to your career when
you<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.430> learn<00:02:02.820> some<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> those<00:02:03.180> skills

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you kind of learn some of those skills

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.380 
you kind of learn some of those skills
at<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> young<00:02:04.350> age
