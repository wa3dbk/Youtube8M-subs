00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 directing again in Mexico is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 monterrey that will happen I'm not going to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 direct to any team of the line 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.670
 professional and good and now there will be 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 value all things things 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.830
 uncertain that were said at the time 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.699
 in the month of June there was not one that 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.860
 was true in relation to me 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.580
 so I want now that it ends up clear me 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 I am no usurer of any thief 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.059
 I do not get anyone's money I pay my 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.290
 taxes in my country ccoo in a way 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.050
 logical and in no time then because 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.910
 cheated no one I think I've been 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 honest in honest work with all 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 the people that I have worked with this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.760
 with all the institutions and honest 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 with everyone at all times 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
 so I do not want it to go back to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.330
 lie in relation to my moral person 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 with the Mexican Olympic Committee in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 special with the licensed padilla 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.580
 commitments are moral professionals I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.259
 I have already made enough commitments 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 moral commitments are 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.240
 professionals 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.799
 I have committed myself and now 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.719
 it's up to others to commit themselves and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.509
 meet the professionals things 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.159
 contractually professional 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 obviously it is until 2015 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.640
 the parts so that I really have 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 surely something will come out of them 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.250
 good where I will surely take the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.270
 decision for camps the average is fine 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.120
 the good one that has given me problems and 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.500
 the truth that I am happy with the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.970
 operation 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.680

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.640
 all summer, it was worth it to 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.920
 end of the road 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.290
 the letters of the argument 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.269
 we are a great team that we are a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.709
 very good set of human beings that 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.659
 can live for a long time 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 with them and we are always happy 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.390

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.970
 it's a team that competed is a match 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.020
 where could be mexico the agricultural 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.250
 in situations why 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.120
 this game was to win or to live 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.490
 we always have the mentality 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.010
 to win is why I think 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.420
 in the mindset of winning good now it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.420
 ended mexico stayed a long time 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.020
 and it 's a big step for us if 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.880
 we want to be better 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.630

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.749
 today after having managed to pass 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.959
 to the next phase and keep in mind 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:53.120
 you face them you see the most difficult opponent 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.760
 of this type of triples so this happens 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.380

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.260

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.150
 we realized where we are and what 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.850
 we have to keep improving what 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.140
 were your feelings of all this 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.000
 preparation since you have to remember that 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.160
 you played the centrobásket they had 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.020
 that prepare it as hosts and so 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.270
 a preparation of almost three months for 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.680
 end today as you have 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.140
 taken the fact of being concentrated 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.900
 for so long and have that pressure 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.520
 It was not like it was a good experience 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.230
 with us to move forward to 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.460
 improve to continue having the team 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.980
 united and therefore not if it turns out that we move on 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.530
 the next round of the world 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.300
 as much as country as in basketball 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.300
 Mexican but as we said we want 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.590
 keep improving and finally and how 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.210
 you would value the role of sergio 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.980
 valdeolmillos in the evolution that has 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.670
 had Mexican basketball in these 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.000
