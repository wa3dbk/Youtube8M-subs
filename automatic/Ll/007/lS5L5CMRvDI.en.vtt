00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
decided to have some of this very

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.630 
decided to have some of this very
low-fat<00:03:53.210> popcorn<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.530> macros<00:03:54.950> per<00:03:55.190> serving

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
low-fat popcorn so macros per serving

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.820 
low-fat popcorn so macros per serving
and<00:03:55.940> in<00:03:56.240> one<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.450> these<00:03:56.660> bags<00:03:56.990> there's<00:03:57.440> three

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
and in one of these bags there's three

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.280 
and in one of these bags there's three
servings<00:03:58.400> I'm<00:03:58.730> probably<00:03:59.300> gonna<00:03:59.690> have<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.170> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
servings I'm probably gonna have one to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.380 
servings I'm probably gonna have one to
one<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> half<00:04:00.590> servings<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.490> get<00:04:01.940> one<00:04:02.060> half

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
one and a half servings you get one half

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.190 
one and a half servings you get one half
fat<00:04:02.630> 20<00:04:03.530> carbs<00:04:03.950> three<00:04:04.370> protein<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.900> we're

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
fat 20 carbs three protein so we're

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.300

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.660 

yes<00:04:15.010> video<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.160> exporting<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.570> finish

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
yes video is exporting and finish

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.100

figuring<00:04:19.670> out<00:04:19.790> what<00:04:20.030> might<00:04:20.210> wonder<00:04:20.510> at<00:04:20.660> max<00:04:20.900> is

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
figuring out what might wonder at max is

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:31.140 
figuring out what might wonder at max is
currently<00:04:21.590> warming<00:04:21.980> up<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:25.900> he's<00:04:28.810> sorry

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
currently warming up so he's sorry

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.460 
currently warming up so he's sorry
so<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.180> figured<00:04:32.480> I'd<00:04:32.570> give<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.870> guys<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:33.050> quick

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
so I figured I'd give you guys a quick

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.960 
so I figured I'd give you guys a quick
voiceover<00:04:34.220> while<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.460> show<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.730> what<00:04:34.940> I

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
voiceover while I show you what I

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.940 
voiceover while I show you what I
actually<00:04:35.150> worked<00:04:35.480> up<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.290> like<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.650> said<00:04:36.920> I

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
actually worked up to and like I said I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.130 
actually worked up to and like I said I
started<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:37.640> at<00:04:37.970> past<00:04:38.420> midnight<00:04:38.780> so

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
started this at past midnight so

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.620 
started this at past midnight so
definitely<00:04:39.560> not<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.950> ideal<00:04:40.190> situation<00:04:40.630> to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
definitely not the ideal situation to

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.260 
definitely not the ideal situation to
test<00:04:41.990> for<00:04:42.410> an<00:04:42.470> absolute<00:04:43.010> 1<00:04:43.220> rep<00:04:43.400> max<00:04:43.430> but

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
test for an absolute 1 rep max but

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.180 
test for an absolute 1 rep max but
that's<00:04:44.450> really<00:04:44.720> okay<00:04:45.020> for<00:04:45.380> those<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:45.920> not

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
that's really okay for those of you not

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.670 
that's really okay for those of you not
familiar<00:04:46.880> with<00:04:47.390> how<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.660> typically<00:04:48.170> program

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
familiar with how you typically program

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.170 
familiar with how you typically program
you<00:04:48.890> really<00:04:49.130> don't<00:04:49.280> want<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.490> program<00:04:49.670> based

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
you really don't want to program based

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.320 
you really don't want to program based
on<00:04:50.360> an<00:04:50.510> absolute<00:04:51.140> max<00:04:51.920> because<00:04:52.430> it's<00:04:53.090> not

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
on an absolute max because it's not

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.730 
on an absolute max because it's not
something<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.990> could<00:04:54.110> hit<00:04:54.260> every<00:04:54.560> day

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
something that you could hit every day

something that you could hit every day
you<00:04:55.280> want<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.520> program<00:04:55.760> off<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.330> something

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
you want a program off of something

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.380 
you want a program off of something
called<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.380> training<00:04:57.830> max<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.820> what<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:58.970> decided

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
called a training max and what I decided

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.200 
called a training max and what I decided
to<00:04:59.720> do<00:04:59.870> was<00:05:00.730> simulate<00:05:01.730> basically<00:05:02.180> a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
to do was simulate basically a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.240 
to do was simulate basically a
competition<00:05:02.720> situation<00:05:03.530> so<00:05:03.770> I'm<00:05:03.830> doing<00:05:04.100> this

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
competition situation so I'm doing this

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.970 
competition situation so I'm doing this
pause<00:05:04.550> in<00:05:04.940> my<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.600> deep<00:05:05.900> hours<00:05:06.260> but<00:05:06.530> as<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.830> guys

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
are gonna see I work up to a weight

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.200 
are gonna see I work up to a weight
where<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.800> definitely<00:05:10.400> had<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> little<00:05:10.880> bit<00:05:10.970> left

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
where I definitely had a little bit left

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.750 
where I definitely had a little bit left
in<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.420> tank<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:13.010> was<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.220> competition

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
in the tank but it was a competition

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.820 
in the tank but it was a competition
pause<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.600> it's<00:05:14.870> something<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.320> I'm<00:05:15.410> very

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
pause and it's something that I'm very

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.860 
pause and it's something that I'm very
confident<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.610> could<00:05:16.700> hit<00:05:17.000> every<00:05:17.180> single

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
confident that I could hit every single

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.220 
confident that I could hit every single
day<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.470> I<00:05:18.860> actually<00:05:19.040> do<00:05:19.490> work<00:05:19.820> up<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.750> PR

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230
