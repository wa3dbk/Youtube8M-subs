again two three and check around and so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.610 
again two three and check around and so
on<00:01:08.760> throughout<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> maneuver<00:01:09.620> you'll

on throughout the maneuver you'll

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.890 
on throughout the maneuver you'll
achieve<00:01:10.740> regular<00:01:11.340> observation<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.120> you'll
