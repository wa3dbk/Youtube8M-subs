00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
inventory and we got a star let's try it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.700 
inventory and we got a star let's try it
again

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.150

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and there we go another star so that's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
and there we go another star so that's
it<00:00:29.340> guys<00:00:29.580> today<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:31.170> am<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> show<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.899> my

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it guys today I am going to show you my

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
it guys today I am going to show you my
wishing<00:00:34.410> well<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> really

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
wishing well with a which is a really

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.830 
wishing well with a which is a really
simple<00:00:36.630> idea<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> every<00:00:38.460> item<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.540> throw

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
simple idea so every item that you throw

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200 
simple idea so every item that you throw
in<00:00:39.870> sides<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.280> stored<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in sides are going to be stored here and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
in sides are going to be stored here and
if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.469> throw<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.820> something<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:46.460> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
if you throw in something that's not of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
if you throw in something that's not of
interest<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> goes<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.870> an<00:00:49.379> automatic

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
interest it goes to an automatic

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
interest it goes to an automatic
disposal<00:00:50.820> system<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.379> throw<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
disposal system that will throw the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.029 
disposal system that will throw the
items<00:00:53.129> inside<00:00:53.699> lava<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.750> people<00:00:55.440> cannot<00:00:55.680> clog

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
items inside lava so people cannot clog

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.959 
items inside lava so people cannot clog
our<00:00:56.250> machine<00:00:56.640> let's<00:00:57.270> try<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:58.320> some

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
our machine let's try it with some

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
our machine let's try it with some
gravel<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.570> disposal<00:01:04.559> systems

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
gravel so as long as disposal systems

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.000 
gravel so as long as disposal systems
field<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.850> throw<00:01:06.090> items<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> lava<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
field it will throw items in lava and it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.390 
field it will throw items in lava and it
works<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:09.060> parallel<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.070> future

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
works in parallel with the the future

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.899 
works in parallel with the the future
system<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.430> whatever<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
system so if you whatever you want to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.230 
system so if you whatever you want to
give<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.920> press<00:01:17.130> after<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.909> put

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
give back to the press after you put

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.740 
give back to the press after you put
inside<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.310> dropper<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:21.360> dispense

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
inside this dropper and it will dispense

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.980 
inside this dropper and it will dispense
it<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.200> using<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.979> item<00:01:23.549> elevator<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.570> simple

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it up using an item elevator very simple

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.649 
it up using an item elevator very simple
hem<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.740> let's<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
hem so let's go and do that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.950 
hem so let's go and do that
alright<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> materials

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
alright so here I have all the materials

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
alright so here I have all the materials
that<00:01:31.049> you're<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.950> need<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.579> build<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that you're going to need to build this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.350 
that you're going to need to build this
so<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.079> start<00:01:34.439> by<00:01:34.650> placing<00:01:35.060> reference<00:01:36.060> here

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so let's start by placing reference here

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
so let's start by placing reference here
so<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.960> place<00:01:37.170> hoppers<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.670> not

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so we can place hoppers that are not

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.980 
so we can place hoppers that are not
facing<00:01:39.390> each<00:01:39.540> other

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
facing each other

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.670 
facing each other
darts<00:01:40.700> alright<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.659> better<00:01:43.320> reference

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
darts alright so for better reference

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.480 
darts alright so for better reference
this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.310> where<00:01:44.909> chest<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this is where chest is going to be and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.679 
this is where chest is going to be and
let's<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:48.000> building<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> future<00:01:48.630> for

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
let's start by building a future for

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.010 
let's start by building a future for
this<00:01:51.689> hoppers<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.880> comparator<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this hoppers so comparator here it's a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440 
this hoppers so comparator here it's a
very<00:01:55.229> classic<00:01:55.470> filter<00:01:56.130> alright

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
very classic filter alright

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.499 
very classic filter alright
fancy<00:01:57.780> stuff<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.820> done<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.330> will

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
fancy stuff here and it's done we will

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
fancy stuff here and it's done we will
fill<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.530> later<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.860> needed

they<00:02:41.489> flow<00:02:41.819> into<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.269> future<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:43.049> are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
they flow into the future if they are

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.780 
they flow into the future if they are
not<00:02:44.510> filtered<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.930> go<00:02:46.110> inside<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.920> chest<00:02:47.220> they

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
make a filter for that for example I'm

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.780 
make a filter for that for example I'm
going<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.570> use<00:04:05.900> emeralds<00:04:06.560> here<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.280> place<00:04:07.520> to

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
going to use emeralds here so place to

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.970 
going to use emeralds here so place to
here<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:10.820> place<00:04:11.360> 18<00:04:12.050> emeralds<00:04:12.770> here

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
here and now we place 18 emeralds here

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.090 
here and now we place 18 emeralds here
so<00:04:13.250> once<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.700> tweet<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.210> one<00:04:14.450> will<00:04:14.630> fall<00:04:15.100> so

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
so once you tweet this one will fall so

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.720 
so once you tweet this one will fall so
now<00:04:16.700> we<00:04:17.299> have<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.959> choose<00:04:18.170> which<00:04:18.560> item<00:04:19.130> we<00:04:19.370> want

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
now we have to choose which item we want

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.460 
now we have to choose which item we want
to<00:04:19.970> dispense<00:04:20.660> whenever<00:04:21.650> someone<00:04:22.460> gives<00:04:22.910> us

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
to dispense whenever someone gives us

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.300 
to dispense whenever someone gives us
the<00:04:24.470> emeralds<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.720> should<00:04:26.930> place<00:04:27.310> your

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
the emeralds so it should place your

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.910 
the emeralds so it should place your
items<00:04:28.790> like<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:30.080> dropper<00:04:30.560> will

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
items like that the dropper will

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.030 
items like that the dropper will
dispense<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:32.120> random<00:04:32.930> item<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.830> more

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
dispense a random item so it's more

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.450 
dispense a random item so it's more
interesting<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.850> believe<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.190> because<00:04:37.190> you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
interesting I believe so because you

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.910 
interesting I believe so because you
don't<00:04:37.880> know<00:04:38.060> what<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.390> get<00:04:38.660> when<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.680> throw

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
don't know what you get when you throw

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.500 
don't know what you get when you throw
your

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
your

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.250 
your
emeralds<00:04:41.510> inside<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:43.280> let's<00:04:44.150> run<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.990> first

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
emeralds inside so let's run the first

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.340 
emeralds inside so let's run the first
test<00:04:45.560> here<00:04:45.860> by<00:04:46.190> throw<00:04:46.400> some<00:04:46.760> emeralds

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.030 

so<00:04:51.950> first<00:04:52.370> time<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.970> use<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:54.590> elevator

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
so first time you use it the elevator

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.640 
so first time you use it the elevator
must<00:04:55.490> be<00:04:55.820> fueled<00:04:56.210> up<00:04:56.420> for<00:04:57.170> it<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.410> start

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
must be fueled up for it to start

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.130 
must be fueled up for it to start
working<00:04:58.100> so<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.340> first<00:04:58.580> time<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:59.090> comes<00:04:59.510> an

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
working so the first time it comes an

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.100 
working so the first time it comes an
item<00:05:00.560> comes<00:05:00.740> out<00:05:01.330> means<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.420> it's<00:05:02.750> ready<00:05:03.020> to

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
item comes out means that it's ready to

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.550 
item comes out means that it's ready to
go

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
go

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.860 
go
so<00:05:03.710> every<00:05:04.250> time<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.580> throw<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.150> right<00:05:05.300> item

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
so every time you throw the right item

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.970 
so every time you throw the right item
now<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.350> will<00:05:06.980> output<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:08.110> random<00:05:09.110> stuff<00:05:09.710> to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
now it will output a random stuff to

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.180 
now it will output a random stuff to
your<00:05:10.100> inventory<00:05:11.260> all<00:05:12.260> right<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.740> let's<00:05:12.890> check

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
your inventory all right and let's check

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.360 
your inventory all right and let's check
that<00:05:13.370> spools<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.850> system<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.630> it's<00:05:17.930> working

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.820 

what<00:05:22.370> else<00:05:22.730> can<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.780> show<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:24.080> on<00:05:24.380> another

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
what else can I show you on another

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.320 
what else can I show you on another
detail<00:05:25.250> is<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.990> works<00:05:27.320> well<00:05:27.940> if<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.120> draw

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
detail is that it works well if you draw

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.710 
detail is that it works well if you draw
single<00:05:29.780> items<00:05:30.260> but<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:31.310> someone<00:05:31.880> tries<00:05:32.690> to

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
single items but if someone tries to

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.070 
single items but if someone tries to
throw<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.140> whole<00:05:33.770> stack<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.330> system<00:05:35.510> may

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
throw a whole stack the the system may

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.710 
throw a whole stack the the system may
fail<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:38.110> what<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.500> good<00:05:40.400> fix<00:05:40.730> for<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.000> is<00:05:41.480> to

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
fail so what a good fix for that is to

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.180 
fail so what a good fix for that is to
start<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.110> clock<00:05:42.380> whenever<00:05:43.450> any<00:05:44.450> items<00:05:45.200> are<00:05:45.380> on

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
start a clock whenever any items are on

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.940 
start a clock whenever any items are on
a<00:05:46.250> stack<00:05:46.730> of<00:05:46.760> items<00:05:47.300> are<00:05:47.450> thrown<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:48.080> place<00:05:48.920> a

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
a stack of items are thrown so place a

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.180 
a stack of items are thrown so place a
repeater<00:05:49.280> here<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:53.350> comparator<00:05:54.350> here<00:05:54.380> in<00:05:54.920> a

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
repeater here and a comparator here in a

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.370 
repeater here and a comparator here in a
subtraction<00:05:55.760> mode<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.330> another<00:05:56.600> repeater<00:05:57.140> on

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
subtraction mode and another repeater on

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.220 
subtraction mode and another repeater on
two<00:05:57.800> ticks<00:05:58.070> here<00:05:58.400> all<00:05:58.910> right<00:05:59.300> so<00:05:59.570> now<00:06:00.200> let's

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
two ticks here all right so now let's

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:07.140 
two ticks here all right so now let's
test<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:00.980> again

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.390 

and<00:06:08.150> we<00:06:08.540> can<00:06:08.720> throw<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.930> whole<00:06:09.170> stack<00:06:09.890> now<00:06:10.130> and

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
and we can throw a whole stack now and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.090 
and we can throw a whole stack now and
it<00:06:10.730> should<00:06:10.760> work<00:06:11.330> because<00:06:11.870> this<00:06:12.170> clock<00:06:12.440> is

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
it should work because this clock is

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.630 
it should work because this clock is
going<00:06:13.460> to<00:06:13.640> be<00:06:13.760> started<00:06:14.410> and<00:06:15.410> yeah<00:06:15.590> guys<00:06:15.830> now

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
going to be started and yeah guys now

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.150 
going to be started and yeah guys now
you<00:06:16.700> can<00:06:18.070> build<00:06:19.070> up<00:06:19.340> your<00:06:19.580> URL<00:06:20.530> chewing<00:06:21.530> oh<00:06:21.710> and

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
you can build up your URL chewing oh and

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.750 
you can build up your URL chewing oh and
whatever<00:06:22.580> height<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.030> want<00:06:23.690> and<00:06:24.490> fill<00:06:25.490> it<00:06:25.640> up

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
whatever height you want and fill it up

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.580 
whatever height you want and fill it up
with<00:06:25.820> water<00:06:26.450> I<00:06:27.370> like<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.610> use<00:06:28.820> a<00:06:29.720> glowstone

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
with water I like to use a glowstone

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.520 
with water I like to use a glowstone
here<00:06:31.070> where<00:06:31.400> those<00:06:31.670> blocks<00:06:32.000> are<00:06:32.210> so<00:06:32.930> get<00:06:33.260> some

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
here where those blocks are so get some

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.400 
here where those blocks are so get some
lighting<00:06:33.770> effects<00:06:34.550> down<00:06:35.060> there<00:06:35.360> and<00:06:35.750> I

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
lighting effects down there and I

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.970 
lighting effects down there and I
believe<00:06:36.740> that<00:06:36.770> it's<00:06:38.140> yeah<00:06:39.140> it's<00:06:39.530> all<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:39.950> I
