 hello everyone welcome this video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.970
 tutorial where I will teach them to relive the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.460
 cellular blue dash 5.0 to many has 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.799
 passed that when turning on the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.379
 cell phone stuck in the logo 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.539
 of blue and will no longer boot and also 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.330
 it can be in the android logo this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.100
 it goes through a bug in the software and what 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 what we have to do is flash the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.939
 cellular and if this happens to you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.429
 I recommend that you stay to see this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.520
 video is very simple to do and I 'm going 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.530
 to give it to you to do it well we're going to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.200
 need some things a usb cable 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 obviously the cell phone a laptop or 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.100
 computer and three files that you or 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.430
 leave in the description of the video to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.580
 that downloads 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.810
 the first file is the original 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.390
 cellular the second is where the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.930
 drivers that we are going to occupy and the third 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.250
 file is the application or the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.500
 tool that we are going to use for 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 flashing the cell phone first thing 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.610
 we have to do is extract the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.070
 archives of the rom when we click 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.070
 right and we give in extract here 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.159
 and if it will begin to extract 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 well here it's going to take a little bit like that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.040
 that we are moving forward and we are going to extract 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.640
 the drivers we are going to extract the drivers 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.649
 while still extracting the rom 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.649
 we right click and extract here 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.970
 we already have estrada and now we are going to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.970
 extract 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.719
 the color tool or the program 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.720
 well once we have extracted everything 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.760
 come on, the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.130
 install the drivers let's go to the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.119
 drivers folder 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 and we're going to go here to 16 at the bat and we're going to 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.140
 give a double click 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.590
 and we are going to click on yes or accept and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.380
 we hope it charges and it will open 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.290
 this we click on next 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.510
 and finish and we have the drivers 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 installed 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.079
 Now let's go back to the folder 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.329

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:42.280
 about the icon that says flash tool xxi 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.140
 dot exe we give right click and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.140
 we run as administrator 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.970
 we click yes 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.810

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.700

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 rom folder we selected this 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.060
 archive 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.060
 and we click open 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.840
 the next step is to connect the cell phone 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.710
 without the battery to the computer or laptop 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.950
 and click on the button that says download 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.290
 If this appears to you, you give it to yourself if you do not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.739
 Well, no 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.969
 well now that it is there we are going to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.969
 introduce the battery 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.000
 to the cell phone 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 and start 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.260
 the application to work as you want and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 it started 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.010
 well here I will be a little video 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.370
 to TV it may take a little longer 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.310
 but until you get this screen 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.160
 you can disconnect the cell 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.160
 well now I'm going to disconnect the cell 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.379
 and I'm going to light it 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.400
 and here where it was stuck to you 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.590

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.800
 and do not worry , stay a little while 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.960
 here as it is the first time you start 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.520
 the cell phone will take a little bit because 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.710
 remember that it is as if it were 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.590
 factory again because as you see already what 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.200

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.510
 and we adjust all the configuration already 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.040
 What follows is good for you and 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.780
