than<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.360> stairwell<00:01:30.950> now<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.670> gets<00:01:32.850> too

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
than the stairwell now if it gets too

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.149 
than the stairwell now if it gets too
congested<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.439> lower<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
congested for you you can lower the

like<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.620> said<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:35.090> may<00:02:35.270> take<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> few<00:02:35.630> tries<00:02:36.050> to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
like I said it may take a few tries to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.130 
like I said it may take a few tries to
do<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.670> think<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.780> easiest

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140

way<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> do<00:02:39.830> it
