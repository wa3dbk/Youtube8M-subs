00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.630
 I am happy to talk to the macaque 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.580
 next time 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.679
 the others traveled east 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.009
 looking for those kills with his hands looks 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.840
 in the faces of the covenant everything is 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.200
 well so we decide to separate 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.079
 a degree 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:41.179
 and they went to do things of guys 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.789
 come to us to do things for girls just 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.710
 with a hat I let him be a boss because of that 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.469
 be the biggest 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.239
 we will investigate that cabin can 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.329
 who have seen survivors of the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.170
 alliance with the cabin good idea 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.170
 you first 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.979
 i 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.799
 these statues are as if they had life 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.610
 own had and cat locked which I 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.900
 like that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.900
 he has pretty eyes 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.650
 they never see me coming 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 we travel south until night 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.510
 drought said very well ditch 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 the pop 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.879
 soon we will camp but before 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.120
 we will take advantage of the darkness can do 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.030
 some recognition good idea 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.940
 explore that area there 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.930
 I protect the store the danger 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.610
 not rich you stay here try that 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.610
 this time do not kill anyone 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.080
 over here and kirin 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.950
 I'll cover you from up here it's dark 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.400
 so you'll have to mark the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.950
 objectives we will find here when 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.400
 finish 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.650
 I found smoke bombs in my pocket 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.170
 they would have to serve if they tripped 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.080
 some enemy and would launch a bomb of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.680
 smoke Sofia's rifle would take care of 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.680
 rest 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.410
