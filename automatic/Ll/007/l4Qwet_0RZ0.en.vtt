so today I'm going to be showing you
guys<00:00:08.670> with<00:00:09.059> fertilizer<00:00:09.660> now<00:00:10.380> as<00:00:10.710> usual<00:00:10.920> if<00:00:11.340> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
guys with fertilizer now as usual if you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.330 
guys with fertilizer now as usual if you
place<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.139> suicide<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.889> actually

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
place it this is suicide that's actually

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.700 
place it this is suicide that's actually
going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.880> active<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.540> keep<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.109> mind

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
going to be active so keep that in mind

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
going to be active so keep that in mind
when<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.010> place<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.490> down<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.990> machine

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
when you place it down now this machine

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.790 
when you place it down now this machine
can<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.680> powered<00:00:20.039> by<00:00:20.070> either<00:00:20.580> MJ<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.420> EU<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
can be powered by either MJ or EU it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.870 
can be powered by either MJ or EU it
doesn't<00:00:23.490> matter

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
doesn't matter

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.779 
doesn't matter
it<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.300> takes<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.810> energy<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> uses<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> now

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it just takes of energy and uses it now

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.330 
it just takes of energy and uses it now
as<00:00:27.090> before<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.349> set<00:00:28.529> up<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> machine<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
as before if you set up this machine you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.820 
as before if you set up this machine you
need<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.730> set<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.720> line<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
need to set it up in line with the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.700 
need to set it up in line with the
planter<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> set<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:33.989> we'll

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
planter so if we were to set it up we'll

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.840 
planter so if we were to set it up we'll
be<00:00:34.860> setting<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.840> yeah<00:00:37.129> okay<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
be setting it up right yeah okay the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.479 
be setting it up right yeah okay the
crafting<00:00:39.840> recipes<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.890> machine<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
crafting recipes for this machine is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150 
crafting recipes for this machine is
pretty<00:00:41.760> easy<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> just

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pretty easy this is the one if you just

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
pretty easy this is the one if you just
have<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> recipe<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.899> has

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have this recipe well if you just has

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
have this recipe well if you just has
very<00:00:46.320> small<00:00:46.469> pack<00:00:46.800> installed<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
very small pack installed if you have a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
very small pack installed if you have a
thermal<00:00:48.480> expansion<00:00:49.050> installed<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> for

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
thermal expansion installed this is for

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.360 
thermal expansion installed this is for
crafting<00:00:50.820> recipe<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:52.129> if<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
crafting recipe you need to use if you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
crafting recipe you need to use if you
have<00:00:53.399> thermal<00:00:53.850> expansion<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.840> doesn't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
have thermal expansion this one doesn't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
have thermal expansion this one doesn't
work<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.149> keep<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
work all the time so just keep that in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010 
work all the time so just keep that in
mind<00:00:58.039> by<00:00:59.039> default<00:00:59.520> these<00:00:59.940> things<00:01:00.239> make<00:01:00.539> these

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
mind by default these things make these

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
mind by default these things make these
things<00:01:01.199> only<00:01:01.440> fertilizer<00:01:02.039> free<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.760> free<00:01:03.030> area

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
things only fertilizer free by free area

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.520 
things only fertilizer free by free area
but<00:01:04.019> luckily<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.830> quite<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> range<00:01:05.760> of

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
but luckily you get quite a range of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
but luckily you get quite a range of
extenders<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:08.880> radius

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
extenders so you can see here radius

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.740 
extenders so you can see here radius
increase<00:01:10.080> nine<00:01:10.470> eleven<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.600> all

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
increase nine eleven one so but all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
increase nine eleven one so but all
depends<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
depends on what you want to do so as you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
depends on what you want to do so as you
can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> harvesting

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
can see here this thing is harvesting

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.410 
can see here this thing is harvesting
but<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.470> slow<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.240> only

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but it's pretty slow well it has only

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
but it's pretty slow well it has only
been<00:01:21.540> harvesting<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.380> ten<00:01:22.619> minutes

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
been harvesting for about ten minutes

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
been harvesting for about ten minutes
maybe<00:01:23.310> five<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.570> efficient<00:01:25.080> but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
maybe five now so it's efficient but

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
maybe five now so it's efficient but
it's<00:01:25.680> slow<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> even

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it's slow so if you want to make it even

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
it's slow so if you want to make it even
faster<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:30.060> give<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
faster all you have to do is give it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
faster all you have to do is give it
power<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.200> using<00:01:31.380> redstone<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
power I'm just using redstone in it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.749 
power I'm just using redstone in it
energy<00:01:32.700> cells<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.420> easier<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
energy cells because we easier so if you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
energy cells because we easier so if you
can<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:37.110> three<00:01:37.470> types<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can use any of these three types of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.630 
can use any of these three types of
fertilizer<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.500> fertilizer<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.890> comes

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
fertilizer this is fertilizer that comes

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.530 
fertilizer this is fertilizer that comes
with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.780> mod<00:01:42.990> pack<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.210> don't<00:01:45.210> know<00:01:45.270> we'll

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
with the mod pack so I don't know we'll

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
with the mod pack so I don't know we'll
just<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.810> using<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> can

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
just be using all of them so as you can

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.200 
just be using all of them so as you can
see<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.979> fertilizes<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> small<00:01:50.520> area<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
see it only fertilizes a small area in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.319 
see it only fertilizes a small area in
front<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.070> were<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> give<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
front of it but if we were to give it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
front of it but if we were to give it
the<00:01:54.740> range<00:01:55.740> extender<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.000> giving<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the range extender we are giving it the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
the range extender we are giving it the
Emerald<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:59.479> don't<00:02:00.479> know

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Emerald one just because I don't know

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109 
Emerald one just because I don't know
that's<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.280> previously<00:02:02.520> used<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.000> as

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that's one but I previously used so as

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.959 
that's one but I previously used so as
you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.840> using<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.549> types<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you can see it's using all the types of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.419 
you can see it's using all the types of
fertilizer<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.770> wanted<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> finish

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
fertilizer in it I just wanted to finish

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
fertilizer in it I just wanted to finish
this<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> switch<00:02:09.300> over<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.020> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this one and switch over to this one so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
this one and switch over to this one so
you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.039> when<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> fertilizes

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
you can see when it fertilizes

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
you can see when it fertilizes
everything

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
everything

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970 
everything
this<00:02:14.220> does<00:02:14.700> however<00:02:15.230> really<00:02:16.230> run<00:02:16.710> through

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
this does however really run through

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.880 
this does however really run through
fertilizer<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.000> prepaid<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.780> make<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.380> lot<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
fertilizer so prepaid to make a lot of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.300 
fertilizer so prepaid to make a lot of
fertilizer<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.620> fertilizer<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.920> where<00:02:23.070> also

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
fertilizer the fertilizer or where also

with<00:02:29.370> four<00:02:29.610> wooden<00:02:29.850> things<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.800> still<00:02:32.130> need

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
with four wooden things you still need

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.700 
with four wooden things you still need
to<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.640> give<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.000> bit<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.150> power<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.840> some

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
to just give it a bit of power and some

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.020 
to just give it a bit of power and some
fertilizer<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.610> your<00:02:35.730> powers

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
fertilizer you can see your powers

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.330 
fertilizer you can see your powers
building<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> idle<00:02:37.230> toilet<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.220> we

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
building up and the idle toilet so if we

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.180 
building up and the idle toilet so if we
put<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.970> vain<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:40.440> machine<00:02:40.860> will

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
put that in vain this machine will

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640 
put that in vain this machine will
probably<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.180> able<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.960> we<00:02:43.200> need<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> put

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
probably not be able or we need to put

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.180 
probably not be able or we need to put
the<00:02:43.770> range<00:02:43.950> extender<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.740> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the range extender in it and this one so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.680 
the range extender in it and this one so
we'll<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.550> put<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.150> end<00:02:48.360> because

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
we'll just put it in one end because

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.340 
we'll just put it in one end because
it's<00:02:48.900> easier<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.060> should<00:02:51.330> fertilize<00:02:51.930> all

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it's easier so it should fertilize all

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's easier so it should fertilize all
of<00:02:52.680> our<00:02:52.740> trees<00:02:52.980> pretty<00:02:53.700> rapidly<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:55.400> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
of our trees pretty rapidly and this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.270 
of our trees pretty rapidly and this
machine<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.840> has<00:02:57.990> made<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> food<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.100> a

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
machine and has made a lot of food and a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
machine and has made a lot of food and a
lot<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.520> saplings<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:01.110> keep<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.470> mind

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
lot of saplings so just keep in mind

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.740 
lot of saplings so just keep in mind
that<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.690> how<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.470> planter

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that it is now how do I get to a planter

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.390 
that it is now how do I get to a planter
anyway<00:03:06.750> where<00:03:06.959> does<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.230> really<00:03:07.470> matter<00:03:07.680> so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
anyway where does it really matter so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.010 
anyway where does it really matter so
you<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:08.970> pretty<00:03:09.240> effective<00:03:09.630> for

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
you can see it's pretty effective for

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.850 
you can see it's pretty effective for
fertilizing<00:03:10.560> things<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.860> harvester

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
fertilizing things like the harvester

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.770 
fertilizing things like the harvester
well<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.760> plants<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.240> oh<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
well know the plants of oh and the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.750 
well know the plants of oh and the
harvest<00:03:16.140> sometimes<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.770> take<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.310> little<00:03:17.520> while

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
harvest sometimes I take a little while

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.790 
harvest sometimes I take a little while
before<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.840> actually<00:03:19.140> realized<00:03:19.590> these

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
before but actually realized these

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.759 
before but actually realized these
things<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.430> done<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.850> do<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:22.500> it's

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
things to be done and do it so if it's

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.060 
things to be done and do it so if it's
not<00:03:23.000> working<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.660> give<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> second<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
not working just give it a second it

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
not working just give it a second it
will<00:03:26.459> eventually<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.209> realize<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.600> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
will eventually you realize that it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.650 
will eventually you realize that it
needs<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.380> something<00:03:29.300> okay<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.570> think

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
needs to do something okay so I think

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
needs to do something okay so I think
that's<00:03:31.080> about<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.530> thank<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.100> very<00:03:32.310> much<00:03:32.519> for
