soon i believe so anyway he leads off
with<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> blissey<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.230> know<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.500> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
with the blissey and I know that it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.959 
with the blissey and I know that it's
counter<00:00:13.980> blissey<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.460> that's<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.759> what

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
counter blissey because that's just what

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.779 
counter blissey because that's just what
he<00:00:15.030> uses<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.800> we're<00:00:16.800> both<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> set<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
he uses and we're both going to set up a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.769 
he uses and we're both going to set up a
Rock's<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.359> turn<00:00:18.720> um<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.240> he<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.570> going

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779

to go for the protect as i go for the
power<00:00:24.359> wave<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.810> had<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> disconnect

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
power wave because we had a disconnect

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.830 
power wave because we had a disconnect
right<00:00:26.550> before<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.269> decided<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> do

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
right before this and we decided to do

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
right before this and we decided to do
same<00:00:28.050> moves<00:00:28.260> except<00:00:28.949> he<00:00:29.460> didn't

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
same moves except he didn't

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.640 
same moves except he didn't
counter<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.630> turn<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.199> supposed<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
counter this turn like I'm supposed to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
counter this turn like I'm supposed to
but<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.009> okay<00:00:32.219> because<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.180> care

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
but that's okay because I don't care

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.819 
but that's okay because I don't care
here<00:00:33.719> he<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:33.960> got<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> crit<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> first

here he actually got a crit the first

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.420 
here he actually got a crit the first
time<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:36.530> because<00:00:37.530> his<00:00:37.770> feelings<00:00:38.250> were

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
time and because his feelings were

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
time and because his feelings were
killed<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:38.940> hit<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> doesn't<00:00:39.989> so

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.020 
go for the focus blast and if you didn't
know<00:02:55.170> victini's<00:02:55.650> ability<00:02:56.100> increases<00:02:56.610> its

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
know victini's ability increases its

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
know victini's ability increases its
accuracy<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.930> focus<00:02:58.290> blast<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.740> decently

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370

died<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.519> shadow<00:03:56.760> balls<00:03:57.000> plus<00:03:57.209> stealth

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
died it to shadow balls plus stealth

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.110 
died it to shadow balls plus stealth
rock<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.500> leave<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.430> Churchill<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.940> die

rock so I leave in Churchill to die

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.340 
rock so I leave in Churchill to die
which<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.570> sad<00:04:00.900> because<00:04:00.950> um<00:04:02.300> yeah<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.630> here<00:04:04.290> i

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
which is sad because um yeah and here i

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.259 
which is sad because um yeah and here i
go<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.590> my<00:04:04.680> shand<00:04:05.010> era<00:04:05.250> because<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.910> scarf

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
go to my shand era because it is scarf

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.780 
go to my shand era because it is scarf
and<00:04:06.600> um<00:04:07.170> i<00:04:07.470> guess<00:04:07.650> he<00:04:08.010> wasn't<00:04:08.250> predicting

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and um i guess he wasn't predicting

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.150 
and um i guess he wasn't predicting
scarf<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.390> suppose<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.380> he<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:10.740> stays

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
scarf I suppose so he just stays

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.180 
scarf I suppose so he just stays
in<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.550> eat<00:04:11.850> Shadow<00:04:12.240> Ball<00:04:12.420> trees<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.380> dies<00:04:13.800> so

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
in and eat Shadow Ball trees and dies so

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.509 
in and eat Shadow Ball trees and dies so
that's<00:04:14.340> cool<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.840> um<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.950> I'm<00:04:17.040> able<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.340> take

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that's cool and um so I'm able to take

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.040 
that's cool and um so I'm able to take
out<00:04:17.640> his<00:04:17.730> gengar<00:04:18.120> which<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.540> really<00:04:18.870> good

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
out his gengar which is really good

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.390 
out his gengar which is really good
because<00:04:19.110> that<00:04:19.530> thing<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:19.950> pretty<00:04:20.220> huge

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
because that thing is a pretty huge

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.640 
because that thing is a pretty huge
threat<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.330> my<00:04:21.420> team<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:22.110> he<00:04:22.230> goes<00:04:22.380> knee<00:04:22.560> was

just got rid of the blizzy I thought you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320 
just got rid of the blizzy I thought you
didn't<00:04:25.920> have<00:04:25.950> any<00:04:26.070> immunities<00:04:26.760> left<00:04:27.090> but

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
didn't have any immunities left but

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330 
didn't have any immunities left but
apparently<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.840> was<00:04:28.080> wrong<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:28.980> switch<00:04:29.250> out

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
apparently I was wrong so I switch out

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.160 
apparently I was wrong so I switch out
of<00:04:29.430> my<00:04:29.520> Shander<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.330> go<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.540> my<00:04:30.660> zoo<00:04:30.870> stash

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
of my Shander and I go to my zoo stash

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.560 
of my Shander and I go to my zoo stash
so<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.470> can't<00:04:32.250> think<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.700> Japanese<00:04:33.180> name<00:04:33.390> of

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570
