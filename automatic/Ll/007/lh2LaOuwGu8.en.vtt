00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.419
 Summer time is holiday season 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.419
 That's where the Porsche Boxster comes from 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.650
 So let's go on the highway and sporty gas 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 lost is when he starts his task 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.659
 while the builders Rhineland buildings and facilities go ashore 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.659
 the request will be made if the trend continues 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 then you could also get off the highway again 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.360
 All on the highway for this box are chosen to 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.380
 mid-engine 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.780
 that's how we drive the whole thing that's really fun 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.990
 The advantage of this design is the balanced weight distribution 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 between the axes 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.580
 but beware the border area for the driver in front of a large-scale construction 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.829
 and thus becomes very small 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.090
 until it is ready 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.820
 is the cheapest Zuffenhausener safely on the road without doing too 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 to go through a lot and also a sports car point of view 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.900
 Of course you can drive fast with a Porsche 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.780
 you can also drive slowly we just do the test and already 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.320
 can drive slowly on the ZOW what in the other finalists get off 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 can and run alongside 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.909
 meanwhile 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.479
 You can drive so slowly with a request that you can get out and 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.900
 running alongside is not great 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.749
 but does 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.810
 not quite as much fun in the long run 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.810
 Janos Lazar back to fast on procedures 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.220
 Of course 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310
 only as fast as the traffic rules 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.430
 let two a car are 580 points at 100 pace is he calls that much 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 Self-control of the 20th 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.030
 in our test, the box needed about a liter more than the specified one 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.730
 and yet a liter for its performance nevertheless an acceptable value 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.959
 release 55 hp 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.189
 Boxer empty 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 Now let's take a look where the engine is 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.999
 here is 11 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.999
 now also with the motive 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.529
 forgotten the engine Zuffenhausen but 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.530
 the boxer 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.750
 Werder is going to be with the engine Corp. The engine will be in between 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.600
 passenger compartment 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.079
 and in his trunk 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.619
 Unfortunately you can not see it 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:56.049
 Like every Tuchel, the pubs also break through the flat front and 400 people 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.169
 the 2000 headlights achieved 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.029
 unlike the stronger Esther Williams and the Boxster in series with 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.029
 17-inch wheels, therefore 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.139
 he somehow punched Rath's image as a housewife and to have been a bit of a hit 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.090
 It was better to say that's why I always prepared something 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.800
 and let 's see how much we will get in the two luggage compartments 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.669
 Boxsters get even if really 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 a shopping cart he is full 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.099
 TV looks promising 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.369
 but refuel 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.369
 as the pensions will not be 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:39.329
 130 liters income fits in the rear storage space, however, he is 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.549
 quite flat so that large items can be stowed somewhere else 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.669
 have to 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.179
 so we are prepared to be legs 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.399
 have no problems 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.399
 I have normal 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.639
 so again have 150 liters of luggage space and here is ours 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.869
 big dream bursts 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.749
 Yes 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.879
 almost everything 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.489
 I would say the box there is quite 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 the load volume as good as in shopping cart 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 he looks a bit better already or 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.909
 and not only the animal is much more comfortable where do you get one 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 Shopping cart put player 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.059
 air conditioner 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:29.059
 the 20th 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.390
 and Straufhain's driving habits can not be further communicated 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.080
 precise steering and a lightning fast-shifting dual-clutch transmission 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.309
 leave nothing to be desired 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.940
 Summer sunshine let a narrator and the Porsche Boxster 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.170
 He also deserves a place in my heart, but I have to 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.980
 first to the hairdresser and make me a sensible convertible for like that 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.380
 to let
