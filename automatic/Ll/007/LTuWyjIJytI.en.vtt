00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 and good hello to all and all his 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome interiors for this epic 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.520
 which will focus on one of the most 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 known video game I want 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.059
 obviously talk about assassin's creed 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.080
 before starting with the first date 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.730
 I would like to tell you that I'm not going 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.559
 come back only on dates marking the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 saga and not the output of each game so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.770
 it's absolutely useless to say that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 I forgot this or that game 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 does normal more exceptionally 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 this epic on in two volumes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.250
 why and well simply because 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 that there will be an episode that will talk about 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 video games assassin's creed this one in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 the occurrence elodie wearing on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 adaptations on here whether in comic 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 in movies and other novel so we go 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.309
 immediately attacked this epic 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 we start with a kind of ritual to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 every epic with the first date and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 it's the one of studio creation that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.710
 made the first game of the series in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 question and this is in 1997 that the studio 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 ubisoft montrÃ©al was created by 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.710
 part of the French firm ubisoft this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 studio placed in canada will take care 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.699
 so there without knowing of a saga that goes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 mark the history of the video game 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.300
 having first had a first success in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.520
 2002 with their game tom clancy's splinter 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 cell then in 2003 with the mythical 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 prince of persia the sands of time he 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.320
 is true that the studio was already wearing 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 well this time with magnificent 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.600
 creations 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.490
 but then he was going there started a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 project that will propel them even more 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.299
 high is in 2004 after the success of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 their last game as the project 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.750
 assassin's creed starts to be 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 considered good at the beginning point of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.530
 assassin's creed in sight but rather a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 new chapter of prince of persia 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100
 besides the basic game that was to be 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.869
 name 'prince of persia' assassins of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 assassin's wine creed but why me 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.580
 you say 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.259
 and well just because 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 the universe of this game get away too much 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.460
 Previous opus of Prince of Persia 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 had to change so one of donations and that's 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.939
 maybe it's just that for 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.470
 a lot of players assasin's creed 1 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.390
 remains the best of the series 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.890
 first develop on old engine 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.810
 graph for the sixth generation of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 consoles the game has never failed to see 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 the day the project was 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 abandoned in 2006 but that even 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 after the release of a new engine 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 graph for the seventh generation of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 consoles ubisoft montreal recomposed 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 a team and took over the project in 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.009
 hand 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 it will be necessary to wait until November 16 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 2007 to finally see assassins 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.060
 arrival in the very first part of the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 saga first released on ps3 xbox 360 in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 we 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.400
 2007 it will be necessary to wait a few months 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.560
 to finally see the series on pc is 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120
 so in April 2008 that's five months plus 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.530
 late that the game holds on three 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.090
 platforms are experiencing a very big 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.069
 success when coming out of it 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.440
 ubisoft montreal is already planning a new 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.510
 part of assassin's creed coming out a little 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.040
 living room consoles and going to see the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.680
 first murderer's creed out on 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 portable console so this is you have the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.800
 2008 that the saga invites itself in a 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.790
 new platform of the name of nintendo 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.980
 ds 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.260
 this time developed by gameloft 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.580
 assassin's creed altaÃ¯r's chronicles which 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.720
 had to go out at the same time as the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.700
 first part of the series released 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.709
 finally one year later it goes without saying 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.330
 that the series do not give up stopped in so 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.430
 good way and will continue to develop 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.930
 games on different places and 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.459
 platforms this is also the theme of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 our next date since this is the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.760
 first game is from the last 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.200
 game assassin's creed on facebook sortie 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.630
 September 30, 2010 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.910
 assassin's creed project legacy was in 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.540
 playable online community game on 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 Facebook 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.640
 so why put that sentence oh 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.010
 not so good simply because I 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.510
 no longer exists on May 25, 2013 game 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.739
 were removed from facebook she did not 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.540
 worked more like the rest of the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.730
 applications and was no longer updated 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 since no one really knows what 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.000
 what has become of this game and if it will 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.560
 stand out or not level game that does exist 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.690
 the more here we are with one who has 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.549
 absolutely never existed it's finally 2002 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.500
 that the game assassin's creed utopiales 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.540
 had to go out yes some time packets 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.739
 it would have been a social game focused on 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.480
 management and would happen at the time 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.130
 colonial america no news 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.570
 information has since been given as 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.310
 what many license games have 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.820
 was purely abandoned in full 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.530
 development 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.320
 I hope in any case that in the future 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.160
 next this project will be re-studied us 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.440
 let's come to a game of the series 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.239
 interesting for some and yes no 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.340
 match autism even if not seize but 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.840
 girls finally have their place as 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.850
 that main heroine of a game 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.079
 assassin's creed iii release sees 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.760
 so there for the first time in his 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.799
 series a woman at the controls 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.690
 first released on ps vita under the name 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.130
 of assassin's creed iii release the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.200
 game sees changed its name to 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.700
 assassin's creed release hd during 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.220
 its release on the living room consoles that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.290
 are the playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.700
 without transition we pass another big 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.010
 side of the series that you have to well 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.030
 know his premises you are free to the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.859
 times when traveling and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.750
 lately in the quests and history 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.800
 freedom is a strong point of the seg 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.630
 it's from 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.130
 October 9, 2013 either from the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.080
 Assassin's exit creed black flag 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.150
 that the game really becomes an open 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.890
 certainly before we were very free but 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.239
 as soon as we leave a little too far from 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.130
 point of our mission knee 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.050
 out of sync but there is not any 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 if you validate a quest you can 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.920
 go to the other end of the map without being 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.720
 desynchronizes continuing with good 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.520
 novelty since we are offered for the 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.710
 first time a good and a real 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.630
 co-op in assassin's creed unity that's 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.220
 so on November 13 , 2014 that we 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.620
 could finally realize some 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.270
 cooperation missions up to 4 of course 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.890
 the multi was already present since not 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.510
 flea in the saga but until then 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.680
 it was only for game modes on 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.910
 a small area of the map 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.440
 while there now we are talking 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.270
 well for the first time a hull 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.160
 to perform missions on the map 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.930
 whole and the last date if 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.640
 soon yes it's very accurate with 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.410
 so the exit of assassin's creed 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.480
 victory that will take place during the era 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.950
 Victorian crucial period for the 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.720
 united kingdom that was marked elsewhere 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.880
 by an industrial revolution of 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.530
 large scale brief after the period of 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.270
 the third crusade that of the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.190
 Italian renaissance that of the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.990
 American revolution that of age 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.520
 gold of piracy that of war 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.500
 seven years and that of the revolution 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.180
 French we will finally be able to 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.520
 confront the industrial revolution 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.020
 and so like all the epics it does not 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.950
 I have more than one question left 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.410
 ask yourself who is 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.760
 do you think the epic assassin's 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.380
 creed is over or is she going 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.940
 continue more beautiful then there 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.660
 attention i'm talking about several years 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.660
 for this question 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.720
 and if you are loved this video you can 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.820
 always layman and went to see my 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.710
 ancient epic of minecraft gta or 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.000
 still youtube and heal mode on my 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.889
 chain on this good day to you 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.889
 it was inside by everyone
