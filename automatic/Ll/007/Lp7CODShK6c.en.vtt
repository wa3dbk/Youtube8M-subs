people the way that we incubate is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.360 
people the way that we incubate is
essentially<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> actually<00:00:43.320> embrace<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:44.310> of

essentially to actually embrace all of

essentially to actually embrace all of
these<00:00:44.670> different<00:00:44.820> work<00:00:45.180> styles<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.930> first

these different work styles the first

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.320 
these different work styles the first
time<00:00:46.560> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.490> discover<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.150> new

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
time that you discover something new

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.960 
time that you discover something new
that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> love<00:00:49.280> that's<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.700> first

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
that you love that's what the first

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.750 
that you love that's what the first
moment<00:00:51.450> was<00:00:51.810> like<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.380> I<00:00:52.650> walked<00:00:53.040> up<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
moment was like when I walked up to the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600 
moment was like when I walked up to the
sensor<00:00:54.240> gesture<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.440> saw<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> come<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.580> life

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sensor gesture and saw that come to life

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.260 
sensor gesture and saw that come to life
on<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.970> screen<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.810> knew<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.560> had<00:00:58.590> something

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
on the screen we knew we had something

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.690 
on the screen we knew we had something
when<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.300> took<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.470> first<00:01:01.770> demos<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.400> were

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
when we took the first demos that were

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.149 
when we took the first demos that were
using<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.210> skeletal<00:01:03.750> tracking<00:01:04.259> technology

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
using the skeletal tracking technology

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.940 
using the skeletal tracking technology
and<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.390> had<00:01:06.780> people<00:01:07.020> using<00:01:07.679> every

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and we actually had people using every

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
and we actually had people using every
part<00:01:08.219> of<00:01:08.340> their<00:01:08.460> body<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.240> only<00:01:09.390> were<00:01:09.539> they

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
part of their body not only were they

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.989 
part of their body not only were they
smiling<00:01:10.109> but<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.920> said<00:01:11.130> hey<00:01:11.249> I<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.729> actually

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
smiling but they said hey I was actually

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.940 
smiling but they said hey I was actually
there<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.079> brilliant<00:01:13.409> things<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there one of the brilliant things is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.760 
there one of the brilliant things is
that<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.939> 3d<00:01:15.359> camera<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.289> first<00:01:16.320> time

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that the 3d camera for the first time

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.709 
that the 3d camera for the first time
it's<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.249> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.429> available<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:18.210> gives

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
it's going to be available that gives

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.569 
it's going to be available that gives
you<00:01:18.929> the<00:01:18.960> three-dimensional<00:01:19.799> information

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
you the three-dimensional information

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.459 
you the three-dimensional information
about<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.119> distance<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.719> every<00:01:21.960> point<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
about the distance to every point on the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:23.929 
about the distance to every point on the
body<00:01:22.649> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.189> doesn't<00:01:23.429> actually<00:01:23.490> give<00:01:23.789> you<00:01:23.850> an

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
body but it doesn't actually give you an

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.029 
body but it doesn't actually give you an
interpretation<00:01:24.539> where<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> limbs<00:01:25.319> are<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
interpretation where the limbs are what

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.830 
interpretation where the limbs are what
the<00:01:26.159> angles<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> joints<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.749> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the angles of the joints are so for that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
the angles of the joints are so for that
we<00:01:28.469> need<00:01:28.499> to<00:01:28.679> build<00:01:29.039> software<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:29.939> all

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
we need to build software what it all

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.800 
we need to build software what it all
does<00:01:30.149> is<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.109> evaluates<00:01:32.810> effectively
