00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
christmas-themed I am going to make a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.760 
christmas-themed I am going to make a
brief<00:00:03.740> cupcake<00:00:04.910> so<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.690> cupcake<00:00:07.020> has<00:00:07.529> just

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
brief cupcake so this cupcake has just

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.009 
brief cupcake so this cupcake has just
been<00:00:07.950> iced<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.490> cream<00:00:08.940> cheese<00:00:08.970> frosting<00:00:09.450> in

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
been iced with cream cheese frosting in

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.610 
been iced with cream cheese frosting in
a<00:00:10.230> pale<00:00:10.530> yellow<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> I've<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:11.639> flat<00:00:11.969> iced<00:00:12.210> it

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
a pale yellow and I've just flat iced it

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.259 
a pale yellow and I've just flat iced it
now<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.519> different<00:00:14.639> color<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
now you can do it in a different color I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.939 
now you can do it in a different color I
just<00:00:15.450> think<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> yellow<00:00:15.990> sets<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.710> quite

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
just think the yellow sets it off quite

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.330 
just think the yellow sets it off quite
well

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
well

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.810

she's just gonna pipe them sort of
parallel<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.180> next<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> other<00:00:49.789> going<00:00:50.789> all

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
parallel one next to the other going all

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
parallel one next to the other going all
the<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:51.239> around<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> cupcake<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the way around the cupcake now if you

don't have this nozzle and you've got
another<00:00:55.559> petal<00:00:55.860> nozzle<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:57.180> there's<00:00:57.719> no

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
another petal nozzle then there's no

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.150 
another petal nozzle then there's no
reason<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> try<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.920> something

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
reason not to try it with something

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.479 
reason not to try it with something
different

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.740 

what's<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.699> number<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.539> used

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
what's the number of the one that I used

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.730 
what's the number of the one that I used
to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> point<00:01:04.229> set<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:09.020> PMA<00:01:10.049> fifty<00:01:10.470> three

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to the point set here a PMA fifty three

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
to the point set here a PMA fifty three
would<00:01:11.159> work<00:01:11.400> fine<00:01:11.810> for<00:01:12.810> doing<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.430> any<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
would work fine for doing this any just

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.859 
would work fine for doing this any just
any<00:01:15.030> leaf<00:01:15.299> nozzle<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.689> doing

any leaf nozzle really so I'm just doing

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.899 
any leaf nozzle really so I'm just doing
an<00:01:19.110> up-and-down<00:01:19.650> movement<00:01:20.520> raising<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
an up-and-down movement raising the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.830 
an up-and-down movement raising the
nozzle<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> down<00:01:22.850> or<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> wiggle<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
nozzle up and down or the wiggle as I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.550 
nozzle up and down or the wiggle as I
like<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> call<00:01:25.170> her

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.350 

and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.400> we're<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.580> going<00:01:33.850> all<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.330> way

and then we're just going all the way
around<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.890> circle<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:42.190> when<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.940> get<00:01:43.150> to

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
around in circle and when we get to

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.249 
around in circle and when we get to
where<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:43.570> started<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.490> putting<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.940> in
