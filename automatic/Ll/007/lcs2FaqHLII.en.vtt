00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
whereas on the ipad you notice it's bill

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.090 
whereas on the ipad you notice it's bill
but<00:06:00.729> brighter<00:06:01.120> it's<00:06:01.419> able<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:01.810> draw<00:06:02.680> out<00:06:02.800> some

more of the detail so and there's just a

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.900 
more of the detail so and there's just a
little<00:06:05.530> bit<00:06:05.620> bland<00:06:05.889> tones<00:06:06.250> with<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.700> droid

course<00:06:11.830> we're<00:06:12.010> surprised<00:06:12.340> that<00:06:12.520> both<00:06:12.700> tablets

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
course we're surprised that both tablets

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.300
