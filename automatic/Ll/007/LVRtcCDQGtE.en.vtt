in today's video I will show you a 300

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.800 
in today's video I will show you a 300
spartan<00:00:03.810> dumbbell<00:00:04.350> workout<00:00:05.029> 300<00:00:06.029> repetitions

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
spartan dumbbell workout 300 repetitions

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.140 
spartan dumbbell workout 300 repetitions
if<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.649> make<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.910> first

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
if you can make it and the first

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.290 
if you can make it and the first
exercise<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.139> push-up<00:00:10.590> row

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
exercise is the push-up row

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.249 
exercise is the push-up row
alternated<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> means<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> will

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
alternated and this means that you will

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.250 
alternated and this means that you will
do<00:00:13.440> 10<00:00:13.740> repetitions<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.460> each<00:00:14.820> side<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.199> you

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
do 10 repetitions for each side so you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
do 10 repetitions for each side so you
will<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> push-up<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.820> will<00:00:18.050> do<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
will do a push-up that you will do a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620 
will do a push-up that you will do a
one-handed<00:00:19.980> row<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> dumbbells

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
one-handed row with one of the dumbbells

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.480 
one-handed row with one of the dumbbells
of<00:00:22.020> course<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.500> both<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.130> dumbbells

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
of course not both of the dumbbells

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
of course not both of the dumbbells
because<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.510> will<00:00:24.660> follow<00:00:24.930> your<00:00:25.230> face

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
because they you will follow your face

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.820 
because they you will follow your face
and<00:00:26.599> well<00:00:27.599> that's<00:00:27.900> basically<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.560> 10

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and well that's basically at 10

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
and well that's basically at 10
repetitions<00:00:29.070> each<00:00:29.730> each<00:00:30.269> side<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.199> means

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
repetitions each each side this means

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.340 
repetitions each each side this means
that<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.099> 20<00:00:32.460> push-ups<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:34.050> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that you will do 20 push-ups as well so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
that you will do 20 push-ups as well so

it<00:01:04.199> will<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.650> everywhere<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:07.040> try

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it will go everywhere and also just try

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
it will go everywhere and also just try
not<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> flat

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
not to do this when there is a flat

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
not to do this when there is a flat
screen<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.970> case<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.420> let<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
screen around just in case you let go of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
screen around just in case you let go of
the<00:01:13.110> weight<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> never<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.880> treats

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the weight you never know these treats

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
the weight you never know these treats
in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> Netherlands<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.409> filled<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.890> flat

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
in the Netherlands are filled with flat

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.749 
in the Netherlands are filled with flat
screens<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.470> lucky<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.130> didn't<00:01:20.580> let

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
screens so I was lucky that I didn't let

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.179 
screens so I was lucky that I didn't let
go<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> weights<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.840> clean<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.619> press<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
go of the weights the clean up press is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
go of the weights the clean up press is
pretty<00:01:23.490> difficult<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.240> perform<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> are

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
pretty difficult to perform if you are

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
pretty difficult to perform if you are
using<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.860> lights<00:01:26.220> light<00:01:26.820> weights<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.479> I'm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
using very lights light weights as I'm

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.260 
using very lights light weights as I'm
doing<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
doing here and you are probably going to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
doing here and you are probably going to
use<00:01:30.630> lighter<00:01:30.990> weights<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:32.009> handle

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
use lighter weights that you can handle

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.620 
use lighter weights that you can handle
for<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> 300<00:01:33.930> workout<00:01:34.409> routine<00:01:34.799> anyway<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
for this 300 workout routine anyway so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
for this 300 workout routine anyway so
try<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> perform<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> proper<00:01:38.280> technique<00:01:38.729> but

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
try to perform the proper technique but

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.840 
try to perform the proper technique but
of<00:01:39.329> course<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:41.070> using<00:01:41.159> light<00:01:41.820> weights

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of course if you are using light weights

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.260 
of course if you are using light weights
this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.899> difficult<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
this is pretty difficult to do and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600 
this is pretty difficult to do and
finally<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.659> squat<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> jump<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.250> nothing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
finally the squat and jump so nothing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
finally the squat and jump so nothing
jump<00:01:47.880> squat<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.500> mean<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
jump squat because that would mean that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620 
jump squat because that would mean that
you<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.189> jump<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.850> perform<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.390> squat

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you will jump and then perform a squat

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.319 
you will jump and then perform a squat
in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.930> air<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:53.250> doesn't<00:01:53.790> really<00:01:54.060> go

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
in the air and that doesn't really go

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.020 
in the air and that doesn't really go
that<00:01:54.509> well<00:01:54.750> trust<00:01:55.229> me<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> tried<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.790> might

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that well trust me I tried as you might

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
that well trust me I tried as you might
have<00:01:57.210> noticed<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.259> cold<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.399> why

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
have noticed I have a cold so that's why
