improving and it's getting worse it's
only<00:00:11.730> been<00:00:11.849> 60<00:00:12.240> years<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.840> been

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
only been 60 years that we have been

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.299 
only been 60 years that we have been
apart<00:00:13.200> before<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.009> were<00:00:14.040> living

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
apart before that we were living

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.039 
apart before that we were living
harmoniously<00:00:14.549> together<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.509> think<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> lot<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
harmoniously together I think a lot of

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.960 
harmoniously together I think a lot of
strife<00:00:16.350> would<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.680> away<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.609> took<00:00:17.820> away

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
strife would go away if you took away

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.220 
strife would go away if you took away
the<00:00:18.119> barbed<00:00:18.359> wires<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.840> middle<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the barbed wires in the middle of the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.560 
the barbed wires in the middle of the
two<00:00:19.320> countries<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:20.130> saddens<00:00:20.670> me<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
two countries it saddens me that we have

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.570 
two countries it saddens me that we have
neighbor<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.650> can't<00:00:22.859> even<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.369> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
neighbor that we can't even go with it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
neighbor that we can't even go with it
it<00:00:23.939> has<00:00:24.119> perception<00:00:24.810> which<00:00:24.990> they've<00:00:25.170> drained

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it has perception which they've drained

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
it has perception which they've drained
in<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> headset<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.880> bad<00:00:27.060> guy<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.689> when

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
in the headset as the bad guy but when

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540 
in the headset as the bad guy but when
they<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.050> meet<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> realizing<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
they actually meet and realizing what it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
they actually meet and realizing what it
is<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.090> mainly<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.050> there's<00:00:31.410> no

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is like me mainly because there's no

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
is like me mainly because there's no
communication<00:00:31.859> they're<00:00:32.489> near<00:00:32.820> us<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.570> we

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
communication they're near us but we

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.930 
communication they're near us but we
have<00:00:33.809> no<00:00:33.930> access<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.160> sad<00:00:35.309> put

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
have no access to them and it's sad put

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.340 
have no access to them and it's sad put
this<00:00:36.000> together<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.750> would<00:00:36.960> do

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this together I think we would do

00:00:37.350 --> 00:02:12.540 
this together I think we would do
wonders

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.100 

creating<00:02:13.360> an<00:02:13.450> environment<00:02:13.690> where<00:02:13.960> young

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
creating an environment where young

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.230 
creating an environment where young
people<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.470> exchange<00:02:14.770> ideas<00:02:15.370> hearts

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
people can exchange ideas hearts

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.090 
people can exchange ideas hearts
gestures<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.440> take<00:02:17.860> away<00:02:18.040> that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
gestures and take away that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.610 
gestures and take away that
communication<00:02:18.790> gap<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.150> exists<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.350> have

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
communication gap that exists if I have

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
communication gap that exists if I have
any<00:02:21.130> opportunity<00:02:22.060> go<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.240> India<00:02:22.600> I'll<00:02:22.870> surely

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
any opportunity go to India I'll surely

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.710 
any opportunity go to India I'll surely
go<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.430> whole<00:02:24.610> idea<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:25.090> actually

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
go there the whole idea of actually

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.810 
go there the whole idea of actually
touching<00:02:26.290> hands<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.160> communicating

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
touching hands it's like communicating

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.730 
touching hands it's like communicating
with<00:02:28.030> each<00:02:28.060> other<00:02:28.300> without<00:02:28.540> words<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.350> that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
with each other without words and that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.680 
with each other without words and that
action<00:02:29.980> speaks<00:02:30.550> louder<00:02:30.670> than<00:02:31.150> anything<00:02:31.420> else

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
action speaks louder than anything else

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.840 
action speaks louder than anything else

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
this is what we are supposed to do right

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.880 
this is what we are supposed to do right
we<00:02:34.300> are<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.630> take<00:02:34.780> minus<00:02:35.170> steps<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
we are going to take minus steps so that

we are going to take minus steps so that
we<00:02:36.220> are<00:02:36.280> going<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> solve<00:02:36.730> bigger<00:02:37.000> issues<00:02:37.530> it
