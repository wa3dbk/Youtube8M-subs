00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.020
 new video today I want to show you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.219
 how to change a brake disc resp 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.089
 conversion from 160 to 200 of course needed 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.690
 you have a suitable adapter as well 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.250
 the brake disc that you want to write down 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 which brake discs size ago mount 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 can or I recommended is informed 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 you there with the manufacturer some 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 manufacturers say that a maximum of 180 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.170
 millimeter is possible of course it is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
 possible a 203 millimeter thin 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 to mount disc but there is yes 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.430
 always a risk but despite 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.910
 All this I think the principle is that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.879
 same 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.020
 I build myself from 160 original today 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 I was 180 or crooked by accident 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.059
 first made 116 year on it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.250
 I build today the 108 the 203 mm 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 brake discs on it and wish you there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 first much fun as we see ourselves 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.030
 laughed right first 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.030
 Of course we take the impeller out 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.250
 with a suitable talk or 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 Allen key solutions from our 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 brake caliper 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.250
 with the brake disk adapter I would 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.229
 always recommend 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.210
 I would not take brand manufacturers 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.720
 recommend any or china 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 Imports to take the appropriate 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 screws included dry lok time 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 are already always with everyone 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.799
 adapter with it at the adapters is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.149
 to pay attention to mark 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.970
 here it means that comes up 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.950
 The adapters are without washers 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.160
 set with the current, it is easy 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.160
 rejuvenated 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:43.810
 with a suitable in the bus or taxi in 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.810
 completely put on hadamar 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.260
 So after the adapter is mounted 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.260
 Let's take care of the brake disc 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.790
 Axis just out of the way 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.790
 schnellspanner 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.450
 matching shots 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.260
 all analyzes 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.750
 so after brake disc then solved 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:03.440
 we will have the new brake disc 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:10.700
 To have such a fat free finger 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.740
 have at the new brake disc is 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.880
 to pay attention to the direction of travel 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.880
 is always an arrow up 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:34.080
 In any case always with the new 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.080
 Brake disc use new screws 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.250
 so 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.810
 then tighten tightly 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.340
 also the brake discs are from the factory 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.170
 all metro loud blog day earned at 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.080
 please assemble the brand appels on it 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.290
 pay attention if no adapter was pre-assembled 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.570
 and the caliper directly at the fork 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.120
 was not mounted the original old 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.030
 reuse screws but something 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.560
 use longer screws 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.330
 for the simple reason of the complete 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.220
 to take advantage of the profit you see when I am 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.690
 now the right disc under it 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.240
 then the thread is very nice 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.240
 in short, that would not last forever 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.840
 the new crosses are not 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:21.460
 Loosely provide a drop of loctite 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.490
 draufmachen between four drops loose 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.350
 on it make the appropriate 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.270
 washers a little longer 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.190
 use the whole screw 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:37.530
 profit of the bank can be used from 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:37.530
 from the adapters already better 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.860
 Everyone can easily relax a few times 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:56.440
 brake press that the 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:56.440
 align brake pads can hold 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.320
 First, we pull the top screw 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.590
 easy on 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.900
 then the lower screw in ours 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.289
 caliper is adjusted out and it 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.289
 nothing works 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.940
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.910
 if yes then you can get a thumbs up 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.190
 if you no longer have videos from us 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.169
 We would like to miss then 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.699
 happy if you have an abo da load 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.539
 you can raise in a corner on the 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.050
 button 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.680
 In that sense I'm out to look 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.680
 for the last time
