I<00:04:27.070> bet<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.460> also<00:04:28.450> there's<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.960> secondary

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
I bet you also there's a secondary

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.670 
I bet you also there's a secondary
position<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.070> can<00:04:30.220> actually<00:04:30.490> turn<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
position you can actually turn it on the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.470 
position you can actually turn it on the
next<00:04:32.950> step<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.430> if<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.120> drift<00:04:34.330> out<00:04:34.450> of

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
next step is that if you drift out of

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.120 
next step is that if you drift out of
your<00:04:34.630> lane<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:35.140> beeps<00:04:35.380> out<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.950> do

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
your lane it beeps out to you and you do

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.580 
your lane it beeps out to you and you do
nothing<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.060> system<00:04:37.480> will<00:04:37.630> vibrate<00:04:38.230> the

nothing the system will vibrate the

and draw you back into the lane that
