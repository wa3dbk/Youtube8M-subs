00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.910
 IMAGINE A WORLD 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.420
 IN WHICH ALMOST ALL ARE VAMPIRES 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.244
 Do you like being a vampire, son? 

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:24.587
 I'm good for this. Actually, never ... 

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:25.929
 ... I was good to be human. 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.669
 NO ONE AGES 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.874
 Immortality is the ... 

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.470
 ... miracle and we are blessed. 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.010
 AND THE REMAINING HUMANS ARE HUNTED 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 AND ACCUMULATED TO GET BLOOD 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.615
 What will happen when I no longer ... 

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.920
 ... not a drop left? 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.924
 These are desperate times. 

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:50.937
 We only have enough blood to sustain ... 

00:00:50.938 --> 00:00:52.950
 ... to our population until the end of the month. 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.319
 We are talking about the ... 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 ... extinction of the human race. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.550
 If we do not immediately find a blood substitute ... 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.809
 ... this will happen to all of us. 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.399
 A substitute will replace our ... 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.584
 ... need for a human supply. 

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.319
 There will always be some willing to pay ... 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 ... something extra for the real thing. 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.990
 We need your help. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 We want to rebuild the human race. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.330
 A blood substitute is not a cure. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.089
 I was once like you and I am not anymore. 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 Who are you? 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.750
 We are those of the crossbows. 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.210
 The last breath of humanity ... 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.739
 ... will disappear as soon as the blood. 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 I found the cure. I can return them to how they were. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.860
 What is the cure? 

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:34.919
 THIS WINTER 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 - They could kill you. - I'm already dead. 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 THE BATTLE 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.150
 Can anyone hear me? 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.500
 BETWEEN IMMORTALITY 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.670
 They found us. They are everywhere. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.540
 AND HUMANITY 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 Shoot! 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.710
 Do not! 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.980
 IT WILL OCCUR 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.610
 DAYBREAKERS 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.450
 SOON
