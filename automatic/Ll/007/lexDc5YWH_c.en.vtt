sides are flat and fairly deep along the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.599 
sides are flat and fairly deep along the
top<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> header<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:21.000> flat<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.369> it<00:00:23.369> comes

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
top the header is also flat and it comes

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
top the header is also flat and it comes
down<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> nice<00:00:24.300> sill<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> bottom<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
down to a nice sill on the bottom that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 
down to a nice sill on the bottom that
we<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> sit<00:00:26.039> our<00:00:26.340> energy<00:00:26.849> window<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
we can sit our energy window on so this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.690 
we can sit our energy window on so this
should<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:29.400> easy<00:00:29.939> installation

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
should be a pretty easy installation

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.889 
should be a pretty easy installation
first<00:00:32.700> step<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> measure<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.660> window

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
first step is to measure the window

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
first step is to measure the window
opening<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.040> we'll<00:00:35.399> use<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.880> handy

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
opening to do this we'll use this handy

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
opening to do this we'll use this handy
little<00:00:36.540> measuring<00:00:36.960> tape<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> base

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
little measuring tape that has a base

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that's exactly three inches long and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
that's exactly three inches long and
designed<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> deep<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:42.090> corners<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
designed to get it deep into corners so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.030 
designed to get it deep into corners so
you<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.079> bend<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> tape<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> make

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you don't have to bend the tape and make

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
you don't have to bend the tape and make
it<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.460> accurate<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.390> also<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> digital

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it very accurate it's also get a digital

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
it very accurate it's also get a digital
readout<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> quite<00:00:47.039> handy<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> using

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
readout which is quite handy so using

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
readout which is quite handy so using
the<00:00:50.910> tape<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.329> measure<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.960> width<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the tape we measure the width of the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.819 
the tape we measure the width of the
window<00:00:52.850> all<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.420> side<00:00:54.680> over<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
window all the way from one side over to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.029 
window all the way from one side over to
the<00:00:55.920> other<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> same<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> height

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the other you do the same for the height

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.750 
the other you do the same for the height
of<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.000> top<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:01.050> down<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> side

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
of the top all the way down the side

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.080 
of the top all the way down the side
from<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> hitter<00:01:05.000> right<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> sill

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
from the hitter right down to the sill

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.340 
from the hitter right down to the sill
this<00:01:09.090> gives<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.570> two<00:01:09.780> measurements<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this gives you your two measurements of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
this gives you your two measurements of
width<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> height<00:01:11.479> once<00:01:12.479> you've<00:01:12.630> measured

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
width and height once you've measured

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
width and height once you've measured
and<00:01:13.170> ordered<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:13.530> window<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> next<00:01:14.250> step<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and ordered your window the next step is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
and ordered your window the next step is
to<00:01:14.670> mount<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> attachment<00:01:15.570> system<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to mount the attachment system so it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140
