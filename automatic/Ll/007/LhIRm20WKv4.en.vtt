okay<00:00:10.480> here<00:00:11.230> we<00:00:11.259> are<00:00:11.379> walnut<00:00:11.860> labs<00:00:12.070> this<00:00:12.280> is<00:00:12.519> a

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
okay here we are walnut labs this is a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.970 
okay here we are walnut labs this is a
this<00:00:13.059> is<00:00:13.120> plastic<00:00:13.750> distillation<00:00:14.289> experiment

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
this is plastic distillation experiment

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.269 
this is plastic distillation experiment
number<00:00:15.250> three<00:00:16.529> now<00:00:17.529> we've<00:00:17.740> done<00:00:17.919> a<00:00:17.980> couple

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
number three now we've done a couple

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.130 
number three now we've done a couple
couple<00:00:18.849> new<00:00:18.970> things<00:00:19.240> we<00:00:19.419> have<00:00:19.660> we're<00:00:19.930> using

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
couple new things we have we're using

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.980 
couple new things we have we're using
now<00:00:20.380> using<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.800> reflux<00:00:21.220> condenser<00:00:21.400> any<00:00:22.210> vapor

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
now using a reflux condenser any vapor

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.900 
now using a reflux condenser any vapor
that<00:00:23.289> comes<00:00:23.560> out<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:23.800> this<00:00:24.009> tube<00:00:24.369> and<00:00:24.579> goes

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
that comes out of this tube and goes

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.720 
that comes out of this tube and goes
into<00:00:25.840> this<00:00:26.019> tube<00:00:26.500> in<00:00:26.650> an<00:00:26.740> angle<00:00:27.010> that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
into this tube in an angle that

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.150 
into this tube in an angle that
condenses<00:00:28.599> will<00:00:28.810> drip<00:00:29.080> back<00:00:29.320> into<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.679> retort

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
condenses will drip back into the retort

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.509 
condenses will drip back into the retort
and<00:00:30.420> turn<00:00:31.420> into<00:00:31.570> gas<00:00:31.810> we've<00:00:32.800> also<00:00:33.100> increased

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
and turn into gas we've also increased

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.229 
and turn into gas we've also increased
the<00:00:33.790> number<00:00:34.089> of<00:00:34.180> turns<00:00:34.449> in<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.019> secondary

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the number of turns in the secondary

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
the number of turns in the secondary
gasifier<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:39.250> increase<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.790> heat<00:00:39.940> output<00:00:40.390> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
gasifier to increase the heat output and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.990 
gasifier to increase the heat output and
we're<00:00:41.950> going<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.100> heat<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.309> up<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.730> see<00:00:42.879> what

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
we're going to heat it up and see what

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900 
we're going to heat it up and see what
happens<00:00:43.800> while<00:00:44.800> we're<00:00:44.950> waiting<00:00:45.250> for<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.640> unit

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
happens while we're waiting for the unit

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
happens while we're waiting for the unit
to<00:00:46.030> heat<00:00:46.210> up<00:00:46.239> I<00:00:46.510> wanted<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.840> introduce<00:00:47.020> an<00:00:47.350> idea

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to heat up I wanted to introduce an idea

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.029 
to heat up I wanted to introduce an idea
this<00:00:48.910> secondary<00:00:49.690> vaporizer<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.649> actually

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
this secondary vaporizer is actually

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.639 
this secondary vaporizer is actually
doing<00:00:51.280> what<00:00:51.430> we<00:00:51.520> call<00:00:51.640> cracking<00:00:52.329> it's<00:00:53.199> taking

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
doing what we call cracking it's taking

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.619 
doing what we call cracking it's taking
long<00:00:53.980> chain<00:00:54.370> molecules<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.239> turning<00:00:55.539> them

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
long chain molecules and turning them

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.959 
long chain molecules and turning them
into<00:00:55.660> shorter<00:00:56.320> chain<00:00:56.559> molecules<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.820> our

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
into shorter chain molecules and our

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.400 
into shorter chain molecules and our
hope<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.690> if<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:58.870> get<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.079> temperature

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
hope is that if we get the temperature

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.479 
hope is that if we get the temperature
high<00:00:59.590> enough<00:00:59.620> they're<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.280> come<00:01:00.460> out

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
high enough they're going to come out

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.150 
high enough they're going to come out
with<00:01:00.879> an<00:01:01.090> oil<00:01:01.930> which<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.410> basically<00:01:02.739> diesel

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
with an oil which is basically diesel

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.859 
with an oil which is basically diesel
fuel<00:01:03.340> as<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.879> can<00:01:04.000> see<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:04.750> already

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
fuel as you can see it's already

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.290 
fuel as you can see it's already
starting<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.229> smoke<00:01:05.500> your<00:01:06.490> pour<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.060> tune

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
starting to smoke your pour to the tune

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.320 
starting to smoke your pour to the tune
-<00:01:07.770> okay<00:01:08.770> four<00:01:09.250> minutes<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.789> let's<00:01:09.970> see<00:01:10.119> if<00:01:10.210> our

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
- okay four minutes in let's see if our

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.690 
- okay four minutes in let's see if our
gas<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:10.780> flammable<00:01:13.290> whoa<00:01:14.290> it's<00:01:15.100> really

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
gas is flammable whoa it's really

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.010 
gas is flammable whoa it's really
flammable<00:01:17.580> okay<00:01:18.580> five<00:01:18.880> minutes<00:01:19.150> in<00:01:19.570> we're<00:01:19.840> now

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
flammable okay five minutes in we're now

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.200 
flammable okay five minutes in we're now
we're<00:01:20.830> getting<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.369> little<00:01:21.549> bit<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:21.850> distillate

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
we're getting a little bit of distillate

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.179 
we're getting a little bit of distillate
now<00:01:22.360> we're<00:01:22.540> getting<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.930> really<00:01:23.350> nice<00:01:23.740> fog

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
now we're getting a really nice fog

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.490 
now we're getting a really nice fog
coming<00:01:24.670> out<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.030> there<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.869> is<00:01:25.930> an<00:01:26.290> energy

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
coming out of there that is an energy

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.130 
coming out of there that is an energy
rich<00:01:26.950> smoke<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:28.000> we're<00:01:28.150> getting<00:01:28.479> quite<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> lot

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
rich smoke and we're getting quite a lot

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.010 
rich smoke and we're getting quite a lot
of<00:01:29.460> distantly<00:01:30.460> coming<00:01:30.820> out<00:01:30.970> but<00:01:31.240> it's<00:01:31.390> not<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
of distantly coming out but it's not the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.109 
of distantly coming out but it's not the
paraffin<00:01:32.619> this<00:01:32.829> is<00:01:32.979> actually<00:01:33.460> more<00:01:33.670> like<00:01:33.939> an

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
paraffin this is actually more like an

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.600 
paraffin this is actually more like an
oil<00:01:34.420> at<00:01:34.689> this<00:01:34.840> point<00:01:35.229> we'll<00:01:36.040> be<00:01:36.070> excited<00:01:36.549> to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
oil at this point we'll be excited to

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.600 
oil at this point we'll be excited to
look<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:36.939> more<00:01:37.150> later<00:01:38.280> okay<00:01:39.280> we're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
look at that more later okay we're

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.310 
look at that more later okay we're
taking<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.880> step<00:01:40.030> back<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.450> we're<00:01:40.630> getting<00:01:40.899> so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
taking a step back here we're getting so

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.319 
taking a step back here we're getting so
much<00:01:41.560> high-quality<00:01:42.250> smoke<00:01:42.579> now<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.790> concern

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
much high-quality smoke now a concern

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.539 
much high-quality smoke now a concern
that<00:01:43.479> it's<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.780> flash<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> we're<00:01:45.520> just

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
that it's going to flash so we're just

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.249 
that it's going to flash so we're just
taking<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:46.060> step<00:01:46.270> back<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.570> putting<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.229> our

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
taking a step back and putting on our

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.740 
taking a step back and putting on our
safety<00:01:47.619> glasses<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:48.450> waiting<00:01:49.450> but<00:01:49.570> we're

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
safety glasses and waiting but we're

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.319 
safety glasses and waiting but we're
generating<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.320> really<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.189> larger<00:01:51.880> quantity<00:01:52.090> of

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
generating a really a larger quantity of

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.240 
generating a really a larger quantity of
very<00:01:52.719> nice<00:01:52.899> quality<00:01:53.290> oil<00:01:55.770> okay<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> just<00:01:56.860> wanted

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
very nice quality oil okay I just wanted

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.969 
very nice quality oil okay I just wanted
to<00:01:57.340> note<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:58.570> did<00:01:58.780> end<00:01:59.020> up<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.409> very<00:01:59.770> nice

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
to note we did end up with a very nice

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.840 
to note we did end up with a very nice
distillate<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.549> has<00:02:03.790> a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
distillate now this is a this has a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.929 
distillate now this is a this has a
light<00:02:04.509> oil<00:02:04.810> quality<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.680> it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
light oil quality to it

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.729 
light oil quality to it
we'd<00:02:07.329> have<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.570> try<00:02:07.719> running<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.200> an<00:02:08.320> engine<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
we'd have to try running in an engine to

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.460 
we'd have to try running in an engine to
see<00:02:08.950> what<00:02:09.459> it'll<00:02:09.579> do<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.230> very

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
see what it'll do but this is very

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.759 
see what it'll do but this is very
different<00:02:11.860> from<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.989> plastic<00:02:13.989> wax<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.650> we

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
different from the plastic wax that we

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.069 
different from the plastic wax that we
were<00:02:14.920> getting<00:02:15.100> earlier<00:02:15.690> because<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.840> come

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
were getting earlier because this come

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.080 
were getting earlier because this come
out<00:02:17.110> now<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.949> been<00:02:18.430> refined<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> much

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
out now it's been refined at a much

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.409 
out now it's been refined at a much
higher<00:02:19.120> temperature<00:02:20.850> okay<00:02:21.850> here's<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.180> test

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:22.419 
higher temperature okay here's our test

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.150 
higher temperature okay here's our test
engine

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
engine

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.420 
engine
we're<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.610> try<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:24.879> distillate<00:02:25.660> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
we're going to try this distillate and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.920 
we're going to try this distillate and
see<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.700> functions<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.360> gasoline

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
see if it functions is gasoline

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.500 
see if it functions is gasoline
so<00:02:29.170> I've<00:02:29.890> already<00:02:30.190> warmed<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.879> engine<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.330> on

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
so I've already warmed the engine up on

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.259 
so I've already warmed the engine up on
gas<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.230> shut<00:02:33.069> down<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.340> main<00:02:33.640> jet<00:02:33.940> let<00:02:34.209> me

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
gas and shut down the main jet let me

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.240 
gas and shut down the main jet let me
pour<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> little<00:02:34.750> bit<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.050> here<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.920> we'll<00:02:36.069> see

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
pour a little bit in here and we'll see

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.699 
pour a little bit in here and we'll see
if<00:02:36.340> it'll<00:02:36.459> fire<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.500> pour

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
if it'll fire up I'm just going to pour

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.900 
if it'll fire up I'm just going to pour
a<00:02:41.739> little<00:02:41.980> bit<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> because<00:02:42.580> there's<00:02:42.760> not

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
a little bit in because there's not

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
a little bit in because there's not
enough<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.480> put<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.810> fuel<00:02:44.019> tank

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.729 

let's<00:02:47.920> pull<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.220> cord<00:02:48.459> see<00:02:48.610> what<00:02:48.730> happens

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
let's pull the cord see what happens

00:02:49.739 --> 00:03:00.179 
let's pull the cord see what happens
here<00:02:50.739> we<00:02:50.860> go

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.900 

we<00:03:01.189> made<00:03:01.430> gas<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.569> works
