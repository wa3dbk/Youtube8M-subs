in the movie the dark knight by
christopher<00:00:30.529> nolan<00:00:30.560> they<00:00:30.950> introduced<00:00:31.369> a

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
christopher nolan they introduced a

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.889 
christopher nolan they introduced a
technology<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.239> sends<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.870> receives

technology that sends and receives
sounds<00:00:33.770> from<00:00:34.220> any<00:00:34.399> cell<00:00:34.730> phone<00:00:35.060> and<00:00:35.270> then

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
sounds from any cell phone and then

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.590 
sounds from any cell phone and then
using<00:00:35.600> sonar<00:00:36.290> maps<00:00:36.890> out<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.370> location<00:00:38.030> while

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
using sonar maps out that location while

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.060 
using sonar maps out that location while
it<00:00:38.750> seems<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.989> little<00:00:39.020> bit<00:00:39.230> far-fetched<00:00:39.530> the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
it seems a little bit far-fetched the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.890 
it seems a little bit far-fetched the
underlying<00:00:40.430> principle<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.360> can<00:00:41.600> be<00:00:41.720> found

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
underlying principle of it can be found

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.860 
underlying principle of it can be found
in<00:00:42.080> this<00:00:42.230> hack<00:00:42.560> minus<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.550> sonar<00:00:43.910> mapping<00:00:44.210> i'm

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
in this hack minus the sonar mapping i'm

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.330 
in this hack minus the sonar mapping i'm
going<00:00:44.990> to<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:45.170> using<00:00:45.200> linux<00:00:46.010> for<00:00:46.190> this

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
going to be using linux for this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.950 
going to be using linux for this
tutorial<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.000> i'm<00:00:47.090> going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.270> go<00:00:47.330> to<00:00:47.420> system

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
tutorial so i'm going to go to system

tutorial so i'm going to go to system
administration<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.130> then<00:00:49.550> synaptic<00:00:50.180> package

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
administration and then synaptic package

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.120 
administration and then synaptic package

won't<00:01:08.180> be<00:01:08.299> using<00:01:08.329> BTW<00:01:09.140> scanner<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:09.979> it's

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
won't be using BTW scanner but it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.130 
won't be using BTW scanner but it's
still<00:01:10.280> cool<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.579> look<00:01:10.820> into<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:11.960> once
