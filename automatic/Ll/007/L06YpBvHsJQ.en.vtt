00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.040
 Cypbertron is the mother planet of the Transformers, 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.600
 is the planet from where they started before they landed on Earth. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.120
 It's really fascinating because it has its own story, 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.480
 and what we see is a dying planet. 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.200
 The Transformers will reveal some very interesting parts of their own story, which even they didn't know, 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.720
 throughout the course of the game. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.760
 Which of the original Transformers will we find in the game? 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 A lot. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400
 So far we have already announced 6 or 7, all really unique: 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.760
 Vortex can turn into a helicopter, a jet, as well as a robot, 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 in huge and vast levels where you can fly. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 It is also part of the team of robots that form Bruticus, 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.720
 a real battle titan. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.760
 Grimlock turns into a T-Rex, 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120
 Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.200
 Jazz has its hooked anchor. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.640
 What is the best thing about video games? 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.720
 The thing I'm most proud of the game 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 it's how the characters are so different from each other: 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080
 when you start playing with each of them, 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.040
 each character will challenge you in new and unique ways 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.240
 that will push your expectations on the game even further. 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 Each character has its own personality, 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 Grimlock which is my favorite in the game, 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 he's very big: he doesn't have a gun like all the other characters 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.440
 and turns into a giant spatial reptile that spits fire. 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.400
 Very very different from a character with a hook, very agile, fast and minute 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.920
 which can become invisible, like Cliffjumper. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.040
 Optimus Prime's special ability to control Metroplex: 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 a Transformers the size of a city. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.280
 Each character therefore has a different character and role within the game. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280
 They are all unique and special. 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.640
 What's new in multiplayer? 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.400
 We don't talk much about multiplayer yet but I can tell you that the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.000
 character customization is fantastic. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.720
 As a player you can change the head, the trunk, 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.360
 the upper and lower part of the arms, the legs, the wings, the wheels, the guns, 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.680
 to create your perfect Transformer. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.760
 And all those who loved Transformers so much 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 they will spend hours on the menus just to create their own, perfect Transformer. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.600
 I look forward to connecting online just to see 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.360
 which Transformers will have created the players! 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.040
 Will there be downloadable content? 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.800
 We haven't actually announced our DLC strategy yet, 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.600
 but I can say that our character customization will be decidedly robotic. 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.400
 If you look at the one we made for Transformers: War for Cybertron, 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.800
 when we introduced new characters as part of the DLC, 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.960
 inserting new robots in it could be something we'd like to do.
