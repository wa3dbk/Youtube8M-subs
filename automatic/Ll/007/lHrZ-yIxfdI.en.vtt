00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
watching Midwest whitetail is that if

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.420 
watching Midwest whitetail is that if
you<00:05:18.060> brush<00:05:18.540> them<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:18.900> really<00:05:19.290> well<00:05:19.320> then<00:05:20.310> they

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you brush them in really well then they

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.370 
you brush them in really well then they
can<00:05:20.580> be<00:05:20.669> really<00:05:20.910> effective<00:05:21.210> pretty<00:05:22.020> much<00:05:22.200> on

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
can be really effective pretty much on

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.600 
can be really effective pretty much on
the<00:05:22.410> spot<00:05:22.740> I've<00:05:22.980> never<00:05:23.190> really<00:05:23.430> considered

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
the spot I've never really considered

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.640 
the spot I've never really considered
ground<00:05:24.000> blinds<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.750> be<00:05:24.870> very<00:05:25.110> mobile<00:05:25.290> always

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
ground blinds to be very mobile always

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.530 
ground blinds to be very mobile always
kind<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.890> thought<00:05:25.950> that<00:05:26.100> do<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.090> really<00:05:27.180> get

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
kind of thought that do you really get

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.870 
kind of thought that do you really get
used<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.900> them<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.350> think<00:05:28.410> they<00:05:28.680> do<00:05:28.880> unless

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
used to them and I think they do unless

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.760 
used to them and I think they do unless
you<00:05:30.360> brush<00:05:30.600> them<00:05:30.750> in<00:05:30.900> really<00:05:31.260> really<00:05:31.470> well<00:05:31.650> and

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
you brush them in really really well and

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.200 
you brush them in really really well and
that's<00:05:31.860> exactly<00:05:32.070> what<00:05:32.430> we<00:05:32.520> did<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.090> was

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
that's exactly what we did so that was

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.250 
that's exactly what we did so that was
one<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.510> things<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:33.870> learned<00:05:34.020> off

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
one of the things that I learned off

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.659 
one of the things that I learned off
watching<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.620> guys<00:05:34.770> on<00:05:34.950> midwest<00:05:35.220> whitetail

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
watching the guys on midwest whitetail

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.310 
watching the guys on midwest whitetail
they<00:05:36.120> were<00:05:36.270> setting<00:05:36.540> her<00:05:36.660> blinds<00:05:37.020> up<00:05:37.140> and

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
they were setting her blinds up and

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.960 
they were setting her blinds up and
hunting<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.710> evening<00:05:37.919> and<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:38.790> was

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
hunting on that evening and so I was

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.550 
hunting on that evening and so I was
pretty<00:05:39.150> impressed<00:05:39.330> with<00:05:39.540> that<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.020> I<00:05:40.290> came

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
pretty impressed with that and so I came

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.740 
pretty impressed with that and so I came
down<00:05:40.890> last<00:05:41.100> night<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.640> put<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.300> ground<00:05:42.450> blind
