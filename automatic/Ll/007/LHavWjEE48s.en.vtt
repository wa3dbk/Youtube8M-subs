00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
pretty much it's a really cool seed it's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
pretty much it's a really cool seed it's
pretty<00:01:19.320> cool<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:20.040> practically

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
pretty cool for me I was practically

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
pretty cool for me I was practically
going<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:20.909> picking<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:21.960> different<00:01:22.350> seed

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
going around picking up different seed

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
going around picking up different seed
names<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.070> typing<00:01:23.520> them<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.729> trying<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> see

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
names just typing them in trying to see

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.789 
names just typing them in trying to see
what<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> find<00:01:25.020> suppose<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> best

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
what I can find suppose that's the best

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.080 
what I can find suppose that's the best
way<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.640> cuz<00:01:26.820> obviously

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
way you can do it for now cuz obviously

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.399 
way you can do it for now cuz obviously
there's<00:01:27.240> no<00:01:27.330> forums<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> stuff<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there's no forums and stuff like that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.090 
there's no forums and stuff like that
which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> why<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> did<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.299> go

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
which is why I did this so here we go

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
which is why I did this so here we go
now<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> believe<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.150> seed<00:01:33.450> around<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
now I believe on this seed around it is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.819 
now I believe on this seed around it is
a<00:01:34.610> sort<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> wintry<00:01:36.180> biome<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.689> jungle<00:01:37.650> biome

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a sort of wintry biome a jungle biome

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
a sort of wintry biome a jungle biome
and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.640> obviously<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.119> sand<00:01:39.390> bomb<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and then obviously the sand bomb and I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
and then obviously the sand bomb and I
think<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.409> may<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> normal<00:01:41.130> typical

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
think there may be just a normal typical

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
think there may be just a normal typical
bio<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.049> further<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.799> yeah

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bio a little bit out further but yeah

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
bio a little bit out further but yeah
this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.000> cool<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.750> just

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
this is really cool I think it's just

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
this is really cool I think it's just
over<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> corner<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
over the corner so you can see that just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.859 
over the corner so you can see that just
there<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.710> desert<00:01:50.220> temple<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
there is the desert temple there is the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
there is the desert temple there is the
wintry<00:01:52.320> biome<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> swampy

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
wintry biome there's like the swampy

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.289 
wintry biome there's like the swampy
biome<00:01:54.560> there's<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.860> believe<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
biome there's I believe over there the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.870 
biome there's I believe over there the
jungle<00:01:57.630> biome<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.020> might<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> yeah

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
jungle biome you might see that yeah

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
jungle biome you might see that yeah
let's<00:02:00.030> fly<00:02:00.180> straight<00:02:00.479> over<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> need<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
let's fly straight over so you need to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
let's fly straight over so you need to
do<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.380> cross<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> river<00:02:01.979> over<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
do is cross the river over here and then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
do is cross the river over here and then
you're<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:04.170> much<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:04.619> simple<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you're pretty much there simple as that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
you're pretty much there simple as that
I'll<00:02:05.549> quickly<00:02:06.000> fly<00:02:06.180> over<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.960> sort

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
I'll quickly fly over here you can sort

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
I'll quickly fly over here you can sort
of<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.380> else<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> around<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.459> like

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
of see what else is around it it's like

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
of see what else is around it it's like
a<00:02:08.610> massive<00:02:09.110> sand<00:02:10.110> by<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> might<00:02:11.520> be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
a massive sand by them so you might be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.820 
a massive sand by them so you might be
able<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> find<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.270> know<00:02:12.450> maybe

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
able to find I don't know maybe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.910 
able to find I don't know maybe
there's<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.280> temp<00:02:13.490> or<00:02:13.640> maybe<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.320> sand<00:02:15.320> village

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
there's a temp or maybe a sand village

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.790 
there's a temp or maybe a sand village
for<00:02:16.310> other<00:02:16.730> CNPC<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.600> yeah<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.680> pretty

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
for other CNPC so yeah this is pretty

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.320 
for other CNPC so yeah this is pretty
much<00:02:18.920> what<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> desert<00:02:19.670> temple<00:02:19.970> looks<00:02:20.120> like

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

came back previously and tried to do

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.340 
came back previously and tried to do
this<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.540> by<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.750> first<00:03:26.930> time<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.200> was

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
this just by the first time I was

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.199 
this just by the first time I was
checking<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.709> out<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.100> don't<00:03:28.850> feel<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.030> got<00:03:29.150> a

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
checking it out I don't feel I got a

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.640 
checking it out I don't feel I got a
diamond<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.630> toggle<00:03:29.810> site<00:03:30.080> sort<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.410> hitting

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
diamond to toggle site sort of hitting

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.990 
diamond to toggle site sort of hitting
me<00:03:30.739> skies<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.430> want<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.700> keep<00:03:31.820> on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
me skies if you want to keep on

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.690 
me skies if you want to keep on
reloading<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.130> entering<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.190> seat<00:03:34.370> over<00:03:34.550> and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
reloading and entering the seat over and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.370 
reloading and entering the seat over and
over<00:03:34.880> again<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.120> eventually<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.810> get<00:03:36.050> a

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.949 
of times it wasn't too shabby I just
highly<00:03:46.910> recommend<00:03:46.940> blocking<00:03:47.420> up<00:03:47.660> certain

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
highly recommend blocking up certain

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.990 
highly recommend blocking up certain
entrances<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.950> because<00:03:49.850> obviously

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
entrances like that because obviously

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.949 
entrances like that because obviously
you're<00:03:50.300> going<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> lot<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.810> mobs

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
you're going to have a lot of mobs

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.410 
you're going to have a lot of mobs
coming<00:03:51.320> in<00:03:51.410> eventually<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.980> also<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:53.209> thing

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
coming in eventually and also the thing

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.990 
coming in eventually and also the thing
on<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.630> roof<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.050> I'm<00:03:54.170> not<00:03:54.320> too<00:03:54.470> sure<00:03:54.680> if

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
on the roof there I'm not too sure if

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.280 
on the roof there I'm not too sure if
mobs<00:03:56.000> will<00:03:56.209> obviously<00:03:56.390> get<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.690> there<00:03:56.870> it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
mobs will obviously get out there it's

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.930 
mobs will obviously get out there it's
probably<00:03:57.739> unlikely<00:03:58.340> but<00:03:58.700> nevertheless

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
probably unlikely but nevertheless

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.340 
probably unlikely but nevertheless
