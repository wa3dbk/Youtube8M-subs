00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
going to have to open redsnow back up

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.570

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.939 
because this is a tethered jailbreak and
we<00:05:04.639> need<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:04.910> run<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.240> just<00:05:05.570> boot<00:05:05.840> option<00:05:06.440> so

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
all right now we get the same message as

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.550 
all right now we get the same message as
before<00:05:26.389> it's<00:05:26.570> just<00:05:26.900> telling<00:05:27.139> us<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.410> make<00:05:27.530> sure

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
before it's just telling us to make sure

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.230 
before it's just telling us to make sure
that<00:05:27.710> our<00:05:27.860> devices<00:05:28.190> both<00:05:28.460> plugged<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.030> and

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
that our devices both plugged in and

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.420 
that our devices both plugged in and
powered<00:05:29.660> off<00:05:29.810> again<00:05:30.470> we<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.770> bypass<00:05:30.949> this

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
powered off again we can bypass this

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.610 
powered off again we can bypass this
step<00:05:31.789> just<00:05:32.539> make<00:05:32.930> sure<00:05:32.960> your<00:05:33.229> device<00:05:33.320> is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
step just make sure your device is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.620 
step just make sure your device is
plugged<00:05:34.010> in<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.970> can<00:05:35.060> go<00:05:35.210> ahead<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.419> hold

holding the home button for roughly 10

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.469 
holding the home button for roughly 10
to<00:05:45.620> 15<00:05:45.979> seconds<00:05:46.460> again<00:05:46.940> if<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:47.120> don't<00:05:47.240> get<00:05:47.360> it

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
to 15 seconds again if you don't get it

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.909 
to 15 seconds again if you don't get it
right<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.720> first<00:05:47.930> time<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:48.260> can<00:05:48.380> keep<00:05:48.560> trying

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
right the first time you can keep trying

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.230 
right the first time you can keep trying
you'll<00:05:49.250> know<00:05:49.430> it's<00:05:49.610> right<00:05:49.789> when<00:05:50.150> it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
you'll know it's right when it

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.940 
you'll know it's right when it
automatically<00:05:50.750> bypasses<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.620> screen

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.250 

you

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260 

all<00:06:04.830> right<00:06:04.950> now<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.220> step<00:06:05.550> does<00:06:05.790> not<00:06:05.970> take

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
all right now this step does not take

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.610 
all right now this step does not take
long<00:06:06.510> at<00:06:06.720> all

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
long at all

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.439 
long at all
other<00:06:07.740> devices<00:06:07.979> just<00:06:08.460> going<00:06:08.699> to<00:06:08.820> reboot<00:06:09.210> and

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
other devices just going to reboot and

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.700 
other devices just going to reboot and
this<00:06:09.660> is<00:06:09.780> just<00:06:09.810> how<00:06:10.169> long<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.440> would<00:06:10.530> normally

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
this is just how long it would normally
