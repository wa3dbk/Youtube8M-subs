00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.460 
has switching Treatise so the tweets are
always<00:01:28.120> appears<00:01:28.390> above<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.690> base<00:01:28.930> unit<00:01:29.290> which

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
always appears above the base unit which

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.680 
always appears above the base unit which
is<00:01:29.860> simply<00:01:30.190> switched<00:01:30.490> by<00:01:31.060> switching<00:01:31.540> from

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
is simply switched by switching from

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.630 
is simply switched by switching from
vertical<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.200> horizontal<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:33.310> also<00:01:33.430> got

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
vertical to horizontal it's also got

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.820 
vertical to horizontal it's also got
really<00:01:33.910> nice<00:01:34.030> feature<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:34.540> well<00:01:34.750> if<00:01:34.960> it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
really nice feature as well if it's

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.450 
really nice feature as well if it's
placed<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
placed in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
placed in
a<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:39.000> high<00:01:39.210> position<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:40.350> low<00:01:40.560> position

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a very high position very low position

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
a very high position very low position
we've<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> beam<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.150> function<00:01:42.390> which

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
we've got the beam up function which

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
we've got the beam up function which
took<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.500> image<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.830> very<00:01:44.040> slightly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
took the image up very slightly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
took the image up very slightly
so<00:01:44.850> always<00:01:45.150> images<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> center<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so always images in the center of the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
so always images in the center of the
screen<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.430> useful<00:01:47.580> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
screen which is really useful it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.210 
screen which is really useful it's
really<00:01:48.900> useful<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
really useful also when it's

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.520 
really useful also when it's
used<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.060> sealing<00:01:53.540> where<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.050> can<00:01:54.170> tilt<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
used in sealing where it can tilt the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.110 
used in sealing where it can tilt the
image<00:01:54.560> towards<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.430> retina<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:55.940> don't

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
image towards the retina so you don't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.520 
image towards the retina so you don't
need<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.570> loudspeaker<00:01:57.020> directly

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
need to have the loudspeaker directly

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
need to have the loudspeaker directly
above

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
above

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.740 
above
the<00:01:58.860> listener<00:01:59.010> which<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.370> really<00:01:59.610> useful<00:01:59.760> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the listener which is really useful that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.210 
the listener which is really useful that
they're<00:02:01.080> all<00:02:01.200> transmission<00:02:01.770> line<00:02:01.920> design

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
they're all transmission line design

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.819 
they're all transmission line design
which<00:02:02.520> means<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.210> great<00:02:03.990> bass<00:02:04.320> low

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
which means you get great bass low

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.940 
which means you get great bass low
low<00:02:06.219> levels<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.729> missing<00:02:07.630> high<00:02:08.590> volumes

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
low levels of missing high volumes

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.490 
low levels of missing high volumes
device<00:02:09.519> response<00:02:09.989> since<00:02:10.989> I've<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.200> great

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
device response since I've got great

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.320 
device response since I've got great
power<00:02:11.739> handling<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.400> very<00:02:12.610> wide<00:02:12.849> dispersion

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
power handling and very wide dispersion

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.380 
power handling and very wide dispersion
so<00:02:14.260> within<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.370> room<00:02:15.550> wherever<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.150> in

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
so within the room wherever you are in

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
so within the room wherever you are in
the<00:02:16.480> room<00:02:16.629> you<00:02:16.660> still<00:02:17.019> get<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> good<00:02:17.440> even

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the room you still get a good even

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.259 
the room you still get a good even
frequency<00:02:19.060> response<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.459> thing<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.879> that

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
frequency response the one thing is that

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.300 
frequency response the one thing is that
it's<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.930> caught<00:02:23.110> my<00:02:23.260> eyes<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.860> finish

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's really caught my eyes is the finish

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's really caught my eyes is the finish
to<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.330> speak<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.690> them<00:02:25.840> maybe<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.110> can

factory had developed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.510 
factory had developed
I<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:46.050> they're<00:02:46.170> still<00:02:46.380> fat<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> looked

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I think they're still fat and the looked

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.970 
I think they're still fat and the looked
at<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> frequencies<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.630> radiates<00:02:49.530> off<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
at the frequencies the radiates off the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.589 
at the frequencies the radiates off the
front<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> battle

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
front of the battle

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.750 
front of the battle
and<00:02:51.959> they've<00:02:52.140> designed<00:02:52.439> this<00:02:52.760> acoustic

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and they've designed this acoustic

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.509 
and they've designed this acoustic
material<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:55.319> specifically<00:02:55.799> absorbs<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
material which specifically absorbs that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.550 
material which specifically absorbs that
so<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.239> sound<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.719> very<00:02:57.780> clean<00:02:58.200> than<00:02:58.439> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so they sound very very clean than the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.619 
so they sound very very clean than the
image<00:02:58.769> properly<00:02:59.189> otherwise<00:02:59.489> they'd<00:03:00.060> sound<00:03:00.329> a

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
image properly otherwise they'd sound a

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.270 
image properly otherwise they'd sound a
little<00:03:00.900> bit<00:03:01.109> like<00:03:01.290> someone<00:03:01.620> shouting<00:03:02.099> through

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
little bit like someone shouting through

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.789 
little bit like someone shouting through
a<00:03:02.310> cut<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:03.420> they<00:03:03.510> sound<00:03:03.689> less<00:03:04.019> less<00:03:04.290> much<00:03:04.769> less

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
a cut so they sound less less much less

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.980 
a cut so they sound less less much less
rather<00:03:05.370> than<00:03:05.519> more<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> true<00:03:06.510> monitor

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
rather than more like a true monitor

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.110 
rather than more like a true monitor
no<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.260> looks<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:08.980> there's<00:03:09.220> sealed<00:03:09.550> box<00:03:09.880> unit

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
no it looks like there's sealed box unit

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.120 
no it looks like there's sealed box unit
there<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.840> take<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.380> can<00:03:11.560> go<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.890> wall

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
there so I take it that can go in wall

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.920 
there so I take it that can go in wall
or<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.550> wall<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.300> not<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.450> sealed<00:03:13.720> box

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
or on wall it's it's not a sealed box

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.200 
or on wall it's it's not a sealed box
because<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.410> got<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.670> vent<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
because it's got a the vent is in the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.060 
because it's got a the vent is in the
front<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.660> transmission<00:03:16.990> line<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.950> it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
front it's a transmission line so it's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.839 
front it's a transmission line so it's
an<00:03:18.160> extended<00:03:18.520> line

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
an extended line

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.059 
an extended line
it's<00:03:20.359> called<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.629> h-line<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.590> normally

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
it's called a h-line because normally

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.830 
it's called a h-line because normally
our<00:03:22.159> loudspeakers<00:03:22.790> would<00:03:23.030> be

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
our loudspeakers would be

our loudspeakers would be
the<00:03:25.349> drive<00:03:25.620> unit<00:03:25.830> would<00:03:26.010> appear<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> front

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
the drive unit would appear on the front

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.110 
the drive unit would appear on the front
of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.760> cabinet

then out towards the front but with the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.510 
then out towards the front but with the
with<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.990> wafer<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:38.530> very<00:03:38.950> difficult<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.370> do

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
with the wafer it's very difficult to do

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.850 
with the wafer it's very difficult to do
that<00:03:39.760> because<00:03:40.270> put<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.140> into<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.380> wall<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.770> own

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
that because put it into a wall you own

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.620 
that because put it into a wall you own
it<00:03:42.040> radiating<00:03:42.430> from<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> rear<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.510> have

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
it radiating from the rear so you have

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.960 
it radiating from the rear so you have
to<00:03:43.720> have<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.930> front<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.860> event<00:03:45.790> in

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
to have the front of the the event in

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.300 
to have the front of the the event in
front<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.450> there's<00:03:46.630> no<00:03:46.720> depth<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.350> cabinet<00:03:47.830> so

front but there's no depth of cabinet so

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.130
