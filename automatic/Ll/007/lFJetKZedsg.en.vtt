again today I have to show you something
to<00:00:02.280> clear<00:00:02.460> out<00:00:02.550> oceans<00:00:03.380> this<00:00:04.380> machine<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to clear out oceans this machine is a

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.849 
to clear out oceans this machine is a
modified<00:00:05.670> version<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> Cobra<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.899> don't

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
modified version of the Cobra I don't

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.379 
modified version of the Cobra I don't
call<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.130> Cobra<00:00:08.519> anymore<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.059> water<00:00:09.240> snake

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
call it Cobra anymore it's a water snake

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.570 
call it Cobra anymore it's a water snake
in<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> case<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.620> costs<00:00:11.040> clears<00:00:11.429> out

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
in this case because it costs clears out

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.360 
in this case because it costs clears out
oceans<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.440> want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.040> do

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
oceans and if you want to you can do

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.500 
oceans and if you want to you can do
this<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> another<00:00:14.849> two<00:00:17.000> more<00:00:18.000> complicated

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this and another two more complicated

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.359 
this and another two more complicated
cures<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> look<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.130> blocks

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
cures have to look out for the blocks

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.480 
cures have to look out for the blocks
below<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> lava<00:00:21.740> but<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.130> run<00:00:23.369> around

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
below the lava but if you run around

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 
below the lava but if you run around
with<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.910> potion<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.710> will<00:00:25.890> definitely

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
with a potion that this will definitely

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.019 
with a potion that this will definitely
be<00:00:26.550> faster<00:00:27.000> than<00:00:27.029> putting<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.869> sand<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
be faster than putting up with sand and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
be faster than putting up with sand and
removing<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> scent<00:00:30.359> again<00:00:30.740> this<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
removing the scent again this is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.130 
removing the scent again this is
basically<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.579> downloads<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> Cobra

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
basically a downloads it's not a Cobra

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.100 
basically a downloads it's not a Cobra
expand<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.370> site<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:35.880> well<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
expand it to site as well this thing is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.970 
expand it to site as well this thing is
kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> massive<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.710> removes<00:00:41.840> 75<00:00:42.840> blocks<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of massive it removes 75 blocks of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
kind of massive it removes 75 blocks of
water<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.820> case<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
water in this case you can make it as

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
water in this case you can make it as
big<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:47.239> even<00:00:48.239> though<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> wouldn't

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
big as you want even though I wouldn't

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.490 
big as you want even though I wouldn't
go<00:00:48.960> too<00:00:49.710> crazy<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.219> both<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> sides<00:00:51.030> because

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
go too crazy but both the sides because

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860 
go too crazy but both the sides because
after<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.920> sass<00:00:53.760> increase<00:00:54.180> man<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.690> will

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
after some sass increase man you will

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.090 
after some sass increase man you will
definitely<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:56.039> getting<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:57.030> lag<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.100> if

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
definitely be getting some lag and if

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
definitely be getting some lag and if
you<00:00:59.340> mess<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.260> place<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you mess up one at one place and the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
you mess up one at one place and the
bigger<00:01:02.399> designs<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.210> might<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.439> some

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bigger designs you might have some

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280 
bigger designs you might have some
problem<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.670> believe<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.080> might

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
problem because you believe you might

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
problem because you believe you might
lose<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> few<00:01:08.760> rolls<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> are

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
lose about a few rolls if you are

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
lose about a few rolls if you are
unlucky<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.380> fair<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> placing<00:01:11.460> some

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
unlucky and fair that placing some

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060 
unlucky and fair that placing some
persons<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.860> bad

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
persons and it's going to be really bad

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
persons and it's going to be really bad
because<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.350> miss<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:18.060> person<00:01:18.509> except

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
because of you miss this person except

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
because of you miss this person except
you<00:01:19.470> made<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.770> twenty<00:01:20.220> bucks<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you made it twenty bucks more and that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
you made it twenty bucks more and that
is<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
is going to be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.340 
is going to be
and<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:24.969> to<00:01:25.119> rebuild<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.840> whole<00:01:26.020> thing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
and you have to rebuild the whole thing

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.249 
and you have to rebuild the whole thing
so<00:01:26.710> i<00:01:26.740> wouldn't<00:01:27.159> recommend<00:01:27.249> going<00:01:27.899> way<00:01:28.899> bigger

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
so i wouldn't recommend going way bigger

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.679 
so i wouldn't recommend going way bigger
than<00:01:29.319> this<00:01:29.590> except<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.340> some<00:01:30.850> crazy<00:01:31.270> guy<00:01:31.450> who

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
than this except you some crazy guy who

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.449 
than this except you some crazy guy who
really<00:01:32.170> looks<00:01:32.590> at<00:01:33.399> every<00:01:33.789> piston<00:01:34.539> ten<00:01:34.840> times<00:01:35.079> i

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
really looks at every piston ten times i

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.580 
really looks at every piston ten times i
will<00:01:36.459> provide<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.909> white<00:01:37.299> or<00:01:37.479> not<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.840> if<00:01:38.200> i<00:01:38.380> get

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
will provide a white or not and if i get

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.199 
will provide a white or not and if i get
enough<00:01:38.979> support<00:01:39.130> i<00:01:39.490> will<00:01:39.670> definitely<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.179> it

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
enough support i will definitely do it

enough support i will definitely do it
to<00:01:40.329> Tori<00:01:40.569> for<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.929> morning<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:42.099> I<00:01:42.159> don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
to Tori for this morning but I don't

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010 
to Tori for this morning but I don't
think<00:01:42.579> it's<00:01:42.759> really<00:01:43.000> necessary<00:01:43.149> because<00:01:43.689> it's

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
think it's really necessary because it's

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.130 
think it's really necessary because it's
a<00:01:44.109> kinda<00:01:44.409> easy<00:01:44.560> design<00:01:45.149> jobs<00:01:46.149> with<00:01:46.450> cobra<00:01:46.780> arm

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
a kinda easy design jobs with cobra arm

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.999 
a kinda easy design jobs with cobra arm
and<00:01:48.209> one<00:01:49.209> thing<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.539> note<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.319> can<00:01:50.349> just

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
and one thing to note you can just

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.980 
and one thing to note you can just
artists<00:01:51.640> in<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:52.000> ocean<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.420> need<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> bit

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
artists in the ocean you need to a bit

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.729 
artists in the ocean you need to a bit
occasion<00:01:53.439> around<00:01:53.679> it<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.289> see<00:01:56.560> back

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
occasion around it as you can see back

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.160 
occasion around it as you can see back
here<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:58.060> cover<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.719> back<00:01:58.869> side<00:01:59.140> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
here you just cover the back side of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.649 
here you just cover the back side of
this<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.770> iron<00:02:00.459> blocks<00:02:00.849> or<00:02:01.060> whatever<00:02:01.390> blocks

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
this with iron blocks or whatever blocks

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.130 
this with iron blocks or whatever blocks
you<00:02:01.780> want<00:02:01.989> to<00:02:02.259> build<00:02:02.439> with<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:04.390> guess<00:02:04.509> that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you want to build with and I guess that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.609
