00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
go for Rooney I think I Rooney has been
in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.210> form<00:01:06.450> four<00:01:06.630> months<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
in the same kind of form four months of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
in the same kind of form four months of
tinnitus<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.439> he<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.860> euro<00:01:08.119> 2004<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.299> he

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
tinnitus as he was at euro 2004 when he

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350 
tinnitus as he was at euro 2004 when he
was<00:01:09.479> unstoppable<00:01:10.430> if<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.790> gets<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
was unstoppable if he gets over the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
was unstoppable if he gets over the
injuries<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.049> run<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> injuries<00:01:13.619> he's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
injuries the little run of injuries he's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
injuries the little run of injuries he's
had<00:01:13.890> recently<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:15.390> he's<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> be

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
had recently I think he's going to be

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
had recently I think he's going to be
unstoppable<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> tournament<00:01:16.950> until<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
unstoppable in this tournament until the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310 
unstoppable in this tournament until the
quarterfinals<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.990> he's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
quarterfinals but I think he's going to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
quarterfinals but I think he's going to
rack<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.560> enough<00:01:19.979> goals<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> golden

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
rack up enough goals to be the golden

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
rack up enough goals to be the golden
boot<00:01:21.810> by<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.890> difficult<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.180> after

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
boot by then difficult one really after

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
boot by then difficult one really after
I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.409> they<00:01:25.560> stay<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> competition

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I think if they stay in the competition

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
I think if they stay in the competition
long<00:01:26.670> enough<00:01:26.909> Lionel<00:01:27.659> Messi<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.200> there

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
long enough Lionel Messi could be there

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
long enough Lionel Messi could be there
or<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.829> scored<00:01:29.220> goals<00:01:29.460> unbelievable

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
or there about scored goals unbelievable

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
or there about scored goals unbelievable
amount<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.630> goals<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.960> season<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.530> stay

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
amount of goals this season if they stay

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
amount of goals this season if they stay
in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> competition<00:01:32.070> long<00:01:32.579> enough<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.939> they

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in the competition long enough so they

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.810 
in the competition long enough so they

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
goals from midfield it's done it for

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.420 
goals from midfield it's done it for
Chelsea<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.780> season<00:01:46.170> why<00:01:46.860> shouldn't<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
Chelsea all season why shouldn't do in

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.039 
Chelsea all season why shouldn't do in
the<00:01:47.490> world<00:01:47.670> cup<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.600> lovely<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the world cup that would be lovely I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350 
the world cup that would be lovely I
think<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> Golden<00:01:50.280> Boot<00:01:50.460> winner<00:01:50.490> may<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.149> go

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
think the Golden Boot winner may not go

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
think the Golden Boot winner may not go
on<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> win<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> World<00:01:52.020> Cup<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.340> am<00:01:53.549> I

think David via given they're given
their<00:01:56.070> group<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:57.390> he'll<00:01:57.540> score<00:01:57.780> bundles

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170

in the first phase for Spain I'm not

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.719 
in the first phase for Spain I'm not
necessarily<00:02:02.070> sure<00:02:02.250> whether<00:02:02.460> they'll<00:02:02.579> go<00:02:02.700> on

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
necessarily sure whether they'll go on

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280 
necessarily sure whether they'll go on
to<00:02:02.909> win<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> tournament<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.630> faltered<00:02:04.079> last

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
summer in the Confederations Cup I think

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
in in the African nations for example I

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
think we have to watch out for a couple

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.420 
think we have to watch out for a couple
of<00:02:15.190> those<00:02:15.400> but<00:02:16.120> for<00:02:16.300> me<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.710> Messi's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
of those but for me it will be Messi's

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.370 
of those but for me it will be Messi's
