than this look at all the room in the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.140 
than this look at all the room in the
back<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.100> easily<00:02:15.250> fit<00:02:15.580> people<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:16.000> there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
back we can easily fit people in there

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.760 
back we can easily fit people in there
this<00:02:16.300> side<00:02:16.510> even<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.050> boob<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.380> could<00:02:17.530> sit

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
this side even in the boob we could sit

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.970 
this side even in the boob we could sit
we<00:02:17.950> could<00:02:18.130> fit<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> person<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.750> boot<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.860> we

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
we could fit a person in the boot can we

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.630 
we could fit a person in the boot can we
bring<00:02:21.160> 100<00:02:21.640> miles<00:02:21.820> per<00:02:21.910> hour<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:22.660> gaining

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
bring 100 miles per hour are we gaining

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.070 
bring 100 miles per hour are we gaining
now<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.300> woman<00:02:25.630> gained<00:02:25.810> we're

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
now I think no woman gained we're

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.560 
now I think no woman gained we're
gaining<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:26.980> know<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.400> in

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
gaining on it I don't know what it in

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.960 
gaining on it I don't know what it in
but<00:02:28.570> we're<00:02:28.870> getting<00:02:29.140> right<00:02:29.230> there<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.830> go<00:02:30.010> 102

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
but we're getting right there we go 102

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.900 
but we're getting right there we go 102
point<00:02:31.360> 66<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.740> Cobra<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.370> thought<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.790> was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
point 66 it is a Cobra I thought it was

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.600 
point 66 it is a Cobra I thought it was
a<00:02:33.940> Cobra<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:35.140> now<00:02:35.770> we<00:02:35.830> already<00:02:36.070> know<00:02:36.250> this

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
a Cobra but now we already know this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.910 
a Cobra but now we already know this
thing<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:36.940> an<00:02:37.030> absolute<00:02:37.140> speed<00:02:38.140> demon<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.830> we

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
thing is an absolute speed demon so we

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.500 
thing is an absolute speed demon so we
don't<00:02:39.070> need<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.370> go<00:02:39.520> too<00:02:39.910> crazy<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
don't need to go too crazy with the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.120 
don't need to go too crazy with the
promised<00:02:40.810> upgrades<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.320> say<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.800> we<00:02:41.890> want<00:02:42.070> to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
promised upgrades I say that we want to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.100 
promised upgrades I say that we want to
try<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.370> get<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.580> top<00:02:42.790> speed<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.360> biggest

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
try and get the top speed so biggest

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.470 
try and get the top speed so biggest
engine<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:45.100> actually<00:02:45.730> thinking<00:02:46.239> about<00:02:46.330> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
engine we can actually thinking about it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.699 
engine we can actually thinking about it
we<00:02:46.600> should<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:46.959> auto<00:02:47.230> upgrade

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
we should just go for auto upgrade

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.560 
we should just go for auto upgrade
because<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.700> never<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.000> for<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.420> it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
because I never go for that and it's

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.210 
because I never go for that and it's
going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> calculate<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.320> best<00:02:50.530> engine<00:02:50.980> for

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
going to calculate the best engine for

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.930 
going to calculate the best engine for
us<00:02:51.400> isn't<00:02:51.580> it

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
us isn't it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.370 
us isn't it
and<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.330> maybe<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.660> extra<00:02:52.959> bits<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.260> it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
and we can maybe do extra bits on it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.770 
and we can maybe do extra bits on it
I've<00:02:53.530> never<00:02:54.040> done<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.400> before<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.000> fingers

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I've never done this before so fingers

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.900 
I've never done this before so fingers
crossed<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.170> doesn't<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.980> sheet<00:02:57.400> okay<00:02:57.850> so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
crossed this doesn't go to sheet okay so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.090 
crossed this doesn't go to sheet okay so
the<00:02:58.090> engine<00:02:58.360> we<00:02:58.510> had<00:02:58.690> was<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.260> best<00:02:59.560> engine

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the engine we had was the best engine

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.920 
the engine we had was the best engine
apparently<00:03:00.610> now<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.660> do<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> right

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
apparently now to just do the right

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.870 
apparently now to just do the right
stuff<00:03:02.500> why'd<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.160> more<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.430> future

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
stuff why'd I do this more in the future

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.540 
stuff why'd I do this more in the future
yes<00:03:04.650> exactly<00:03:05.650> what<00:03:05.800> we<00:03:05.920> need<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
yes exactly what we need on there and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
does it have a wing does it have a way

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.830 
does it have a wing does it have a way
it<00:03:08.230> has<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> wing<00:03:08.830> pray<00:03:09.220> praise<00:03:09.910> Phil<00:03:10.270> Spencer

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
it has a wing pray praise Phil Spencer

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.130 
it has a wing pray praise Phil Spencer

again for adding in amazing wings we

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.009 
again for adding in amazing wings we
need<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.620> ballin<00:03:15.340> rims<00:03:15.670> on<00:03:15.970> there<00:03:16.239> there<00:03:16.570> we

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
need some ballin rims on there there we

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.080 
need some ballin rims on there there we
go<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.950> we<00:03:18.130> need<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.340> increase<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.670> size<00:03:18.700> of
