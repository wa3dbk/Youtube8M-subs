00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.340
 forget that old image you're dumb 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.239
 of the fia time development center had to leave a fcc 2 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.999
 but that is the confident code with seven cars 2 is a concept produced 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.820
 only with recyclable and non-polluting materials 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 the main highlight is the electric vehicle promoter 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.930
 but co2 a concept car I think the Pope 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.460
 I saw the smallest possible impact on nature 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.280
 then it is moved by an electric motor 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.030
 and stocked with 93 lithium batteries 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.490
 you can carry the palmeirense commander 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 chelsea's command 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.240
 this flow you turn on and in the car 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.520
 and the other end 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.030
 you plug the outlet of your normally 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.210
 three-pin cable denied that the computer 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 and I wait time to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.610
 because until then seasoning autonomy November 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.800
 it develops 80 horsepower 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 it can reach up to 120 kilometers per hour but this speed was 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840
 limited by the fiemt and in the light of the safety of the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.590
 the kennel is also already known by the public and aldo okada logic 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.770
 used on the line and also this year 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.730
 which can be configured also with any fiat car he percent 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.770
 of the system that my father and through these buttons you can configure 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.770
 some car functions 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 you know how much the electric motor's noise when you step on 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.290
 a little bit stronger on the accelerator 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 all the batteries are 93 in total they are distributed by the car 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.320
 precisely because of its better distribution of weight and also 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.519
 of the action is dynamic 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.719
 with the feeling that you have that the car turned off and it looks like it has something to 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.040
 someone smoking up because the noise level is too low 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.750
 after that very interesting 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.520
 is that we apply in this car in the formal language I think that interesting 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.920
 also hahaha talked to us eat two central elements of supply 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.760
 of the car indecisive between fatima and his dedication but frank I think 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.889
 this contract the pretensions shooting innovative design 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.789
 for the construction of the body of the world thus expects tite then fibers 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.769
 from renewable sources 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.019
 as cicero and curau distressing technology that the construction of structures and new 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.149
 materials from attacks 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.149
 so the materials are light and resistant 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.759
 the composition of the seats is made of material derived from soybean oil 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.129
 recycled 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.430
 strong footprint is not to take the ss2 to the streets 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 at least one fun on atlantis beach
