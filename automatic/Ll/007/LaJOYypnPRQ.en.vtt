this DIY and I will talk to you later
bye<00:00:43.250> try<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.550> pants<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.030> mark<00:00:45.270> with

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
bye try on your pants and mark with

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
bye try on your pants and mark with
chalk<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:45.989> you'd<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> shorts<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> end

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
chalk where you'd like the shorts to end

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
chalk where you'd like the shorts to end
then<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.480> regular<00:00:48.690> wide<00:00:49.079> leg<00:00:49.289> pants

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
then if you have regular wide leg pants

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
then if you have regular wide leg pants
you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.160> simply<00:00:50.489> cut<00:00:50.700> across<00:00:51.000> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you can just simply cut across but

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.270 
you can just simply cut across but
because<00:00:51.930> mine<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> made<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> three<00:00:52.980> different

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because mine is made of three different

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:07.969 
because mine is made of three different
layers<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> cut<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.300> part<00:00:54.719> individually<00:01:06.979> then

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
layers I cut each part individually then

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.429 
layers I cut each part individually then
fold<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.549> hem<00:01:08.909> over<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.869> eighth<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> an

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
fold your hem over about an eighth of an

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
fold your hem over about an eighth of an
inch<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.460> pin<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.970> before

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
inch and you can pin it down before

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
inch and you can pin it down before
sewing<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.290> find<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> easier

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
sewing but I actually find it easier

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
sewing but I actually find it easier
this<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.780> fabric<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this way and because my fabric is so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
this way and because my fabric is so
light<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.070> create<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.729> tension<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> back

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
light I create some tension in the back

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:39.920 
light I create some tension in the back
while<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.960> run<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> through<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> machine

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.690 

then<00:01:40.930> fold<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.440> over<00:01:41.560> once<00:01:41.860> more<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.340> sew<00:01:42.580> it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
then fold it over once more and sew it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.590 
then fold it over once more and sew it
down<00:01:42.759> again<00:01:43.150> don't<00:01:43.750> forget<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.200> backtrack<00:01:44.619> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
down again don't forget to backtrack and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.149 
down again don't forget to backtrack and
there<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.110> it's<00:01:47.619> essentially
