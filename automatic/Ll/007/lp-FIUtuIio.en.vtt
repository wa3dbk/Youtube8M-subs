we want to strum from 5 to 1 and we're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.260 
we want to strum from 5 to 1 and we're
not<00:00:42.710> including<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.280> sixth<00:00:43.580> string

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and the last one when I have a look at

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.510 
and the last one when I have a look at
is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> G<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:49.290> I've<00:00:49.380> got<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.650> 2nd<00:00:50.070> finger<00:00:50.190> on

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
is the G so I've got my 2nd finger on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270 
is the G so I've got my 2nd finger on
3rd<00:00:50.790> fret<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> 6th<00:00:51.570> string<00:00:51.810> my<00:00:52.650> 1st<00:00:52.980> finger

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
on 2nd fret of the 5th and my 3rd finger

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.030 
on 2nd fret of the 5th and my 3rd finger
on<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.850> room<00:00:57.150> on<00:00:57.360> 3rd<00:00:58.050> fret<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> first

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
on my room on 3rd fret of the first

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.920 
on my room on 3rd fret of the first
string<00:00:59.130> and<00:00:59.520> we're<00:00:59.700> plucking<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.540> strumming

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
string and we're plucking or strumming

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.800 
string and we're plucking or strumming
all<00:01:01.080> six<00:01:01.379> strings<00:01:01.559> here

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
all six strings here

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.110 
all six strings here
so<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:04.950> that<00:01:05.010> we've<00:01:05.190> recapped<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> those

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
so now that we've recapped on those

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.940 
so now that we've recapped on those
three<00:01:06.450> hoard<00:01:06.780> shows<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> talk<00:01:07.830> about

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
three hoard shows I want to talk about

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.260 
three hoard shows I want to talk about
the<00:01:08.190> strumming<00:01:08.610> pattern<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the strumming pattern that I'm going to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
the strumming pattern that I'm going to
be<00:01:09.360> doing<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> basic<00:01:10.710> idea<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.220> we're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
be doing so the basic idea is that we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030 
be doing so the basic idea is that we're
doing<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:12.300> strumming<00:01:12.840> pattern<00:01:13.200> per<00:01:13.440> bar<00:01:13.710> if

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
doing one strumming pattern per bar if

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
doing one strumming pattern per bar if
we<00:01:14.190> don't<00:01:14.370> know<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> bar<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.060> yet<00:01:15.270> we'll

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we don't know what a bar is yet we'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
we don't know what a bar is yet we'll
talk<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.050> theory<00:01:16.260> of<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> later<00:01:16.800> but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
talk about the theory of that later but

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.270 
talk about the theory of that later but
basically<00:01:17.490> each<00:01:17.940> bar<00:01:18.420> has<00:01:18.720> four<00:01:19.020> counts<00:01:19.500> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
basically each bar has four counts one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.570 
basically each bar has four counts one
two<00:01:20.760> three<00:01:21.260> four<00:01:22.260> now<00:01:22.530> strumming<00:01:23.340> patterns

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
two three four now strumming patterns

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.710 
two three four now strumming patterns
obviously<00:01:23.940> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.120> be<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.480> bit<00:01:24.570> more

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
obviously going to be a little bit more

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.930 
obviously going to be a little bit more
interesting<00:01:25.290> than<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.430> each<00:01:26.610> four

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
interesting than that for each four

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.490 
interesting than that for each four
counts<00:01:27.360> we're<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.050> doing<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
counts we're going to be doing this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.220 
counts we're going to be doing this
strumming<00:01:28.920> pattern<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:29.400> goes<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:30.600> down

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
strumming pattern which goes down down

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.940 
strumming pattern which goes down down
up<00:01:32.120> down<00:01:33.120> down<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:34.320> down

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
up down down up up down

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.500 
up down down up up down
so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.460> counting<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> group<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> four<00:01:36.420> I'm

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
so if I'm counting a group of four I'm

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.580 
so if I'm counting a group of four I'm
going<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.520> four<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:40.229> three

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going one two three four one two three

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.890 
going one two three four one two three
four<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.330> two<00:01:42.900> downstrokes<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.770> upstrokes

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
four so two downstrokes and upstrokes

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.410 
four so two downstrokes and upstrokes
stroke<00:01:45.900> and<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.110> Down<00:01:46.290> stroke<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.070> together

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
stroke and a Down stroke so all together

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and over again till it makes sense let's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
and over again till it makes sense let's
have<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> look<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.860> trying<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> add<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
have a look at trying to add that to the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
have a look at trying to add that to the
chord<00:02:03.030> shapes<00:02:03.300> now<00:02:03.600> okay<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.530> we've<00:02:04.740> had<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
chord shapes now okay so we've had a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
chord shapes now okay so we've had a
discussion<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.759> bars<00:02:05.970> we've<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.630> talked

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
discussion on the bars we've also talked

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
discussion on the bars we've also talked
about<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.560> strumming<00:02:08.250> pattern<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
about the strumming pattern and the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
about the strumming pattern and the
shapes<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.020> chords<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.100> want<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
shapes of the chords so what I want to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.370 
shapes of the chords so what I want to
do<00:02:11.460> is<00:02:11.610> talk<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:11.850> we've<00:02:12.420> got<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.600> D<00:02:12.810> chord<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
do is talk about we've got a D chord to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.140 
do is talk about we've got a D chord to
start<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.830> progression<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.550> want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> play

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

on the a to cancer for on the D again

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.800 
on the a to cancer for on the D again
and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:48.610> finish<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.120> two<00:02:49.420> accounts<00:02:49.630> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and then we finish on two accounts of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.480 
and then we finish on two accounts of
four<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> G<00:02:50.440> now<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:50.950> want<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.250> add<00:02:51.340> that

four of the G now I want to add that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.550 
four of the G now I want to add that
strumming<00:02:51.970> pattern<00:02:52.240> we<00:02:52.360> had<00:02:52.570> over<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
strumming pattern we had over the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.250 
strumming pattern we had over the
counter<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.010> which<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.520> down<00:02:55.240> down<00:02:55.750> up<00:02:55.930> up

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
counter for which is down down up up

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.170 
counter for which is down down up up
down<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.430> do<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.610> twice<00:02:57.940> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
down so I'm going to do that twice and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.520 
down so I'm going to do that twice and
the<00:02:58.270> D<00:02:58.450> chord<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.960> I'm<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.200> going<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.380> play

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the D chord and I'm just going to play

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.250 
the D chord and I'm just going to play
the<00:02:59.650> full<00:02:59.830> regression<00:03:00.100> now

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.550 

same<00:03:05.950> idea<00:03:06.129> on<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.610> chord

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.110 

back<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> diggin

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
the change from the day to a there's a

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.670 
the change from the day to a there's a
couple<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.930> things<00:03:51.020> that<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.290> can<00:03:51.410> do<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.560> make

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
it a little bit easier what I do it from

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.270 
it a little bit easier what I do it from
the<00:03:53.300> dead<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.200> finish<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.070> lift

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
the dead when I finish that is I lift

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.490 
the dead when I finish that is I lift
the<00:03:55.430> pointer<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.720> middle<00:03:56.990> or<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.290> first

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
the pointer and the middle or the first

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.710 
the pointer and the middle or the first
and<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:57.830> second<00:03:58.190> finger<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.670> left<00:03:59.270> there<00:03:59.510> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
and the second finger I left there and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.690 
and the second finger I left there and
then<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:00.170> drag<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:00.680> third<00:04:00.920> finger<00:04:01.160> back<00:04:01.490> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
then I drag my third finger back and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.050 
then I drag my third finger back and
then<00:04:02.330> put<00:04:02.660> them<00:04:03.140> down<00:04:03.440> on<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:04.100> second<00:04:04.490> fret<00:04:04.790> of

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
then put them down on the second fret of

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.610 
then put them down on the second fret of
the<00:04:05.090> fourth<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.750> third<00:04:05.780> string<00:04:06.290> so

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
the fourth and the third string so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.020 
the fourth and the third string so
instead<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.890> having<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.280> lift<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.760> start

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
again that little lift and drag can help

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.070

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.320 
and then when we go from the a back to
the<00:04:12.170> D<00:04:12.320> again<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:13.460> reverse<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.060> pat

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
the D again we just reverse that pat

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.539 
the D again we just reverse that pat
pattern

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
