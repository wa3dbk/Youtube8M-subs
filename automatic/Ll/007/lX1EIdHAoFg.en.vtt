00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.670 

hard<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.560> say<00:04:46.740> man<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.430> if<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.580> take<00:04:47.820> them

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.760 

if<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.770> take<00:04:52.920> a<00:04:52.950> banana<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> orange<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.680> a

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
if you take a banana and orange it's a

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.490 
guess that's the way I would say it
would<00:05:08.370> taste<00:05:11.150> good<00:05:12.150> so<00:05:12.210> freakin<00:05:12.990> good
