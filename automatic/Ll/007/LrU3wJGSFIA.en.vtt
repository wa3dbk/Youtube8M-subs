and<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:03.970> making<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.390> little<00:02:04.479> base<00:02:04.810> for<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
and this is making a little base for the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.230 
and this is making a little base for the
X<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.590> sit<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:06.010> let's<00:02:06.580> get<00:02:06.729> those<00:02:06.850> eggs<00:02:07.090> and

just place them across the pastry like
this<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.750> there's<00:02:10.959> enough<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.350> for<00:02:11.380> six

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
this and there's enough here for six

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.010 
this and there's enough here for six
people<00:02:12.310> at<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.700> rest<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.150> mixture<00:02:13.510> we're

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
people at the rest of that mixture we're

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.900 
people at the rest of that mixture we're
just<00:02:14.230> sort<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.470> breaking<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.130> over<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.670> top

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
just sort of breaking it up over the top

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.240 
just sort of breaking it up over the top
and<00:02:16.150> in-between<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.750> eggs<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.890> time<00:02:18.100> for

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and in-between the eggs it's time for

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.850 
and in-between the eggs it's time for
that<00:02:18.340> other<00:02:18.520> sheets<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.000> pastry<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.590> because

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that other sheets of pastry now because

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.350 
that other sheets of pastry now because
it's<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.370> top<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.940> eggs<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's got to go on top of the eggs and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.059 
it's got to go on top of the eggs and
cover<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.080> need<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.440> make<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.770> just<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
cover it all I need to make it just a

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.070 
cover it all I need to make it just a
little<00:02:24.100> bit<00:02:24.400> larger<00:02:25.180> sprinkle<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.840> bit

of flour onto your surface and then

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.940 
of flour onto your surface and then
let's<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> paper<00:02:29.080> off<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.800> just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
let's just get that paper off and just

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.340 
let's just get that paper off and just
roll<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> little<00:02:31.000> bit<00:02:31.330> maybe<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.110> couple

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
roll it out a little bit maybe a couple

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.340 
roll it out a little bit maybe a couple
of<00:02:32.500> centimeters<00:02:32.800> larger<00:02:33.550> roll<00:02:34.450> onto<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.870> pin

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
of centimeters larger roll onto your pin

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.009 
of centimeters larger roll onto your pin
so<00:02:35.890> my<00:02:36.310> pie<00:02:36.550> filling<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:37.060> ready<00:02:37.209> all<00:02:37.690> I'm<00:02:37.900> gonna

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
so my pie filling is ready all I'm gonna

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.570 
so my pie filling is ready all I'm gonna
do<00:02:38.290> now<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.769> beat<00:02:39.340> an<00:02:39.459> egg<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.590> run<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.980> all

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
do now is beat an egg so just run it all

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.000 
do now is beat an egg so just run it all
around<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.940> edges<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:44.200> quite<00:02:44.470> close<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
around the edges then quite close to the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.180 
around the edges then quite close to the
filling<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.519> then<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:46.150> roll<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.720> pastry

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
filling and then just roll that pastry

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.030 
filling and then just roll that pastry
back<00:02:48.190> over<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.610> top<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.620> want<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.010> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
back over the top now if you want to I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040 
back over the top now if you want to I
think<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.580> good<00:02:51.670> idea<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.630> neaten<00:02:52.840> up

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
think it's a good idea just to neaten up

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.410 
think it's a good idea just to neaten up
the<00:02:53.200> edges<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> little<00:02:53.590> bit<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the edges a little bit and then just to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.940 
the edges a little bit and then just to
make<00:02:55.540> sure<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.810> completely<00:02:56.230> sealed

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
make sure it's completely sealed

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
make sure it's completely sealed
I<00:02:56.980> finally<00:02:57.519> easiest<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.180> use<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.390> fork<00:02:58.810> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
I finally easiest just use a fork and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.540 
I finally easiest just use a fork and
just<00:02:59.320> dip<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> flour<00:02:59.860> floor<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.459> make

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
just dip it in the flour floor and make

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.520 
just dip it in the flour floor and make
sure<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.790> doesn't<00:03:00.940> stick<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:02.050> then<00:03:02.319> just

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
sure it doesn't stick and then just

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.150 
sure it doesn't stick and then just
press<00:03:03.130> all<00:03:03.760> along<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> edges<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.800> then<00:03:05.980> just

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
press all along the edges and then just

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.500 
press all along the edges and then just
to<00:03:06.220> give<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.519> lovely<00:03:06.819> golden<00:03:07.450> brown

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
to give it that lovely golden brown

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.020 
to give it that lovely golden brown
shine<00:03:08.170> we'll<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.709> brush<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.220> over<00:03:09.640> with

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
shine we'll just brush all over with

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.890 
shine we'll just brush all over with
that<00:03:10.180> beaten<00:03:10.480> egg<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:13.030> I've<00:03:13.150> used<00:03:13.180> seven<00:03:13.750> eggs

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
that beaten egg so I've used seven eggs
from<00:03:14.230> my<00:03:14.410> box<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.799> nine<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.220> obviously

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
from my box of nine and obviously

from my box of nine and obviously
there's<00:03:15.730> lots<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:16.239> different<00:03:16.630> things<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> can
