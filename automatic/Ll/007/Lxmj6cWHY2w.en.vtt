negative effects that are junk foods
cause<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.170> America<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> way

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
cause in America it's just the way

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.659 
cause in America it's just the way
things<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.099> present<00:00:32.460> day<00:00:32.520> and

things go here in this present day and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
things go here in this present day and
age<00:00:32.930> food<00:00:33.930> manufacturers<00:00:34.410> will<00:00:34.920> make

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
age food manufacturers will make

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
age food manufacturers will make
anything<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.930> know<00:00:37.079> people<00:00:37.380> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
anything and then you know people have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
anything and then you know people have
to<00:00:37.620> deal<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:37.920> negative<00:00:38.340> consequences

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to deal with all negative consequences

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.860 
to deal with all negative consequences
so<00:00:39.899> here's<00:00:40.379> how<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> works<00:00:41.300> soda<00:00:42.300> contained

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
so here's how it works soda contained

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
so here's how it works soda contained
high<00:00:43.110> fructose<00:00:43.379> corn<00:00:43.680> syrup<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.489> any<00:00:45.090> type<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
a high fructose space sweetener be it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.479 
a high fructose space sweetener be it
crystalline<00:00:48.000> fructose<00:00:48.620> agave<00:00:49.620> nectar<00:00:49.770> high

crystalline fructose agave nectar high
fructose<00:00:50.700> corn<00:00:50.940> syrup<00:00:51.270> which<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> also

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fructose corn syrup which is also

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
fructose corn syrup which is also
contains<00:00:52.440> mercury<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> cause

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
contains mercury it's going to cause

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
contains mercury it's going to cause
insulin<00:00:54.690> resistance<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.280> insulin

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
insulin resistance now you have insulin

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
insulin resistance now you have insulin
resistance<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.500> known<00:00:58.649> also

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
resistance you have what is known also

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.510 
resistance you have what is known also
as<00:00:59.160> polycystic<00:01:00.079> ovary<00:01:01.079> syndrome<00:01:01.430> which<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
as polycystic ovary syndrome which is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.740 
as polycystic ovary syndrome which is
something<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> affects<00:01:03.120> many<00:01:03.359> women<00:01:03.660> these

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
something that affects many women these

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
something that affects many women these
days<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.409> happens<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> high

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
days and what happens is that high

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
days and what happens is that high
insulin<00:01:06.420> levels<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:07.020> comes<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> result

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
insulin levels which comes as a result

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.060 
insulin levels which comes as a result
of<00:01:08.100> having<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> insulin<00:01:09.390> resistance<00:01:10.070> causes

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
of having the insulin resistance causes

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
of having the insulin resistance causes
your<00:01:11.549> ovaries<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.900> produce<00:01:13.080> more

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
your ovaries to produce more

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.700 
your ovaries to produce more
testosterone<00:01:14.010> than<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.970> normal<00:01:15.450> thereby<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
testosterone than is normal thereby you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.760 
testosterone than is normal thereby you
get<00:01:16.950> facial<00:01:17.640> hair<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.680> you
