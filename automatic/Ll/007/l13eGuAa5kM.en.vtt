00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.060 
not sure I'm still thinking about it
because<00:06:30.940> it<00:06:31.390> does<00:06:31.660> take<00:06:31.960> a<00:06:32.170> while<00:06:32.260> to<00:06:32.590> take

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
because it does take a while to take

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.970 
because it does take a while to take
apart<00:06:33.370> I've<00:06:34.090> taken<00:06:34.360> apart<00:06:34.660> the<00:06:34.860> psp-2000<00:06:35.860> and

that was very simple but the psp1000 one

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.350 
that was very simple but the psp1000 one
