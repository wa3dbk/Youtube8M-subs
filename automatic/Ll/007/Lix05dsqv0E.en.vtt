an<00:03:23.540> idea<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:26.510> created<00:03:26.930> time<00:03:27.110> we<00:03:27.350> created<00:03:27.590> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
an idea we created time we created the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.350 
an idea we created time we created the
concept<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.070> time<00:03:28.190> someone<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.610> be<00:03:28.760> able<00:03:28.880> to

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
come up with ways to gauge things to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.090 
come up with ways to gauge things to
gauge<00:03:32.209> events<00:03:32.600> yeah<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.170> periods<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.980> this

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
gauge events yeah and periods so this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.819 
gauge events yeah and periods so this
time<00:03:34.280> exist<00:03:34.690> or<00:03:35.690> did<00:03:35.810> we<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:36.110> make<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.410> exist
