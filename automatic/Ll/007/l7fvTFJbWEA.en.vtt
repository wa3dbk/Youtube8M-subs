00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.930
 Well, according to a sound decree of victory 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.050
 myself the match was very good i think 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.519
 good atmosphere both teams tried 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.730
 understand the task 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.330
 playing such a very good hockey 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.980
 attacking and we think that we are the first period 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.900
 were the owners blessings that we had 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.699
 many moments like where we didn't score 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.769
 the second slightly openly spoke 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.400
 the owner scored two goals in the third already 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.010
 they kept 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 kept this their victory did not 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.790
 mistakes on us again where some 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.780
 moments where we could score but if we 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.469
 let's set one goal and meringues for such 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.170
 moments can not wait for victory well and 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:57.039
 so you can say the guys tried 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.899
 today myself once again this year is very 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:04.869
 strong team i think so on me 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 shame on this match you ladies baby 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.709
 happy with the result to 1 period played 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.360
 weak but then a little bit 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:16.569
 corrected began to work 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.800
 trite work guys have become and become 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:23.020
 something got scored in such goals but 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.190
 again I want to say that there were of course 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.490
 mistakes team after all this is avant-garde 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 efforts a good team is grateful that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.810
 our goalkeeper and cool defense line 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.399
 a shot well and probably good luck too 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.399
 in our country, thanks 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:54.070
 but the majority of shiitake and we have there 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.470
 year a lot of fool defenders scored 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.750
 but we play through defenders they 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.799
 whip show skill as a glory 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.799
 7 matters game 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.299
 I hope that the future stepmother because 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.099
 today did not have time to fly here 3 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.470
 late i think next you can 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:37.930
 step over 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:39.970
 stabbed it until I say I can't 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.940
 tell how he changed avant-garde again 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.579
 I say this is a top team with us I do not 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.700
 look there fought brighter this year 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.870
 didn't really start but again it's about nothing 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:59.170
 speaks very good players speak there 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:02.530
 played garth set up somehow 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.370
 differently yes no no no also 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.040
 we worked the same short step done 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.030
 go ahead it is a plus for our team we need 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.209
 learn such games 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.090
 keep winning at 5 i want to say 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:39.959
 that not without a share of luck, too, but 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:41.849
 This is not so on the one hand can so 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.750
 say on the other hand we don't have there 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.420
 it was up to him and he is already trying 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.790
 already somewhat low kama something not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.209
 She got a part but we will try to but I 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 should too I will feel it and 4 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:02.569
 a place for the young and it's hard for us there 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.900
 opinion on we want to play on 4 rings and 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.610
 until he got lucky now they didn't send 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.010
 one player another could not several 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.319
 the game so he went into the composition I think 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.989
 what he showed at home 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.229
 what is worth playing 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.229
 composed
