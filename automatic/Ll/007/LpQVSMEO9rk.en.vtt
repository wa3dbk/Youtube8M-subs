00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.000 

Gasca<00:00:06.479> press<00:00:06.689> is<00:00:06.840> a<00:00:06.870> wonderful<00:00:07.590> simple

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
Gasca press is a wonderful simple

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640 
Gasca press is a wonderful simple
solution<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.610> getting<00:00:08.820> more<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.020> wine<00:00:10.320> out

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
solution to getting more of the wine out

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.490 
solution to getting more of the wine out
of<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:11.040> massive<00:00:11.910> grapes<00:00:12.180> then<00:00:12.840> gravity<00:00:13.170> would

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
of the massive grapes then gravity would

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.670 
of the massive grapes then gravity would
just<00:00:13.680> remove<00:00:14.279> so<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.539> essentially<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> bunch

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
just remove so it's essentially a bunch

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.019 
just remove so it's essentially a bunch
of<00:00:16.890> pieces<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.340> wood<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> are<00:00:17.670> all<00:00:17.820> held

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
of pieces of wood that are all held

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.659 
of pieces of wood that are all held
together<00:00:18.150> by<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.539> couple<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.930> rings<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.859> that's

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
together by a couple of rings and that's

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.189 
together by a couple of rings and that's
something<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> comes<00:00:21.390> down<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.720> top<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.929> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
something that comes down on top of it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.159 
something that comes down on top of it
that<00:00:22.349> you<00:00:22.410> could<00:00:22.529> put<00:00:22.619> rocks<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.099> or<00:00:23.689> in<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
that you could put rocks on or in the

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.659 
that you could put rocks on or in the
case<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.679> have<00:00:25.919> now<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.339> more

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
case of what we have now and more

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.220 
case of what we have now and more
reasonably<00:00:27.089> moderate<00:00:27.509> presses<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.079> one

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
reasonably moderate presses like the one

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.439 
reasonably moderate presses like the one
I<00:00:28.259> have<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> big<00:00:29.189> screw<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I have is a big screw it's on the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.840 
I have is a big screw it's on the
interior<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> big<00:00:32.490> nut<00:00:32.700> on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
interior and you just put a big nut on

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
interior and you just put a big nut on
the<00:00:33.000> top<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.390> there's<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.200> big<00:00:34.410> piece<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the top of there's this big piece of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
the top of there's this big piece of
wood<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.100> something<00:00:35.310> then<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.030> take<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> piece

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
wood or something then we take a piece

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.890 
wood or something then we take a piece
of<00:00:36.990> pipe<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:37.560> it<00:00:37.680> onto<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> nut<00:00:38.940> part<00:00:39.240> to

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
of pipe and put it onto the nut part to

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.940 
of pipe and put it onto the nut part to
give<00:00:40.020> us<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.350> leverage<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:40.890> we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
give us a little leverage and then we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.410 
give us a little leverage and then we
just<00:00:41.100> pull<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.490> this<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.090> screw

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just pull on this thing and then screw

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
just pull on this thing and then screw
it<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.720> we<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.650> very<00:00:43.860> slowly<00:00:44.370> initially

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it down we go very slowly initially

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.540 
it down we go very slowly initially
because<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.990> allow<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> juice<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
because I want to allow the juice to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
because I want to allow the juice to
exit<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.240> least<00:00:48.480> amount<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.050> pressure

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
exit with the least amount of pressure

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.710 
exit with the least amount of pressure
possible<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.880> we're<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.210> forcing

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
possible that way we're not forcing

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.330 
possible that way we're not forcing
things<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.200> deeper<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.560> the<00:00:52.710> tissues<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
things from deeper in the tissues and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.890 
things from deeper in the tissues and
muddling<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.880> up<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> things<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.720> are

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
muddling it up with the things that are

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.560 
muddling it up with the things that are
not<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> deep<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.710> tissues<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.240> just<00:00:57.420> take

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
not as deep into tissues so we just take

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
not as deep into tissues so we just take
it<00:00:57.720> really<00:00:57.870> easy<00:00:58.550> what's<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.270> flow

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it really easy what's the the flow

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.280 
it really easy what's the the flow
begins<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.990> slow<00:01:01.200> down<00:01:01.380> to<00:01:02.660> not<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.960> small

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
begins to slow down to not a good small

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.469 
begins to slow down to not a good small
continuous<00:01:04.799> stream<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.369> continue<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
continuous stream that will continue to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.270 
continuous stream that will continue to
screw<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.259> but<00:01:07.859> it<00:01:07.950> seems<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
screw on this thing but it seems that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.739 
screw on this thing but it seems that
all<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.789> stuff<00:01:08.999> that<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.719> that

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
all of this stuff that we get at that

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.810 
all of this stuff that we get at that
pressure<00:01:10.229> level<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.770> most<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.219> man<00:01:11.700> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pressure level the most that a man or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.749 
pressure level the most that a man or
woman<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.719> poured<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.759> thing

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
woman can really put poured on the thing

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.270 
woman can really put poured on the thing
physically<00:01:15.329> that<00:01:16.200> seems<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.679> be<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> different

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
physically that seems to be a different

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.649 
physically that seems to be a different
kind<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.520> material<00:01:17.609> than<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.149> get<00:01:18.359> when<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
kind of material than we get when we

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.989 
kind of material than we get when we
switch<00:01:18.929> over<00:01:19.109> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.460> cheater<00:01:20.460> part<00:01:20.789> which<00:01:20.969> is

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
switch over to the cheater part which is

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.789 
switch over to the cheater part which is
the<00:01:21.210> hydraulics<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.109> allows<00:01:22.319> us<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.530> put

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the hydraulics and that allows us to put

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.370 
the hydraulics and that allows us to put
even<00:01:23.039> more<00:01:23.069> pressure<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.789> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
even more pressure on the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.950 
even more pressure on the
on<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.740> house<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.299> like<00:01:26.509> about<00:01:26.540> that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
on the house and what I like about that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.539 
on the house and what I like about that
particular<00:01:27.409> type<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.740> press<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.189> it<00:01:28.369> doesn't

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
particular type of press is it doesn't

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.850 
particular type of press is it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:29.150> require<00:01:29.299> electricity<00:01:29.860> to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
necessarily require electricity to

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.570 
necessarily require electricity to
operate

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
operate

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.300 
operate
it's<00:01:32.940> very<00:01:33.210> simple<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.830> operated

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's very simple and it can be operated

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's very simple and it can be operated
very<00:01:35.460> slowly<00:01:36.170> because<00:01:38.330> if<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.660> operate<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
very slowly because if we operate this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
very slowly because if we operate this
thing<00:01:40.200> slowly<00:01:40.710> different<00:01:41.310> things<00:01:41.490> come<00:01:41.700> out

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
thing slowly different things come out

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.130 
thing slowly different things come out
of<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> press<00:01:42.300> at<00:01:42.480> different<00:01:42.750> times<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
of the press at different times and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.100 
of the press at different times and
different<00:01:43.320> pressures<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.190> different

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
different pressures you know different

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.390 
different pressures you know different
types<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.350> materials<00:01:46.830> are<00:01:46.950> released<00:01:47.250> from

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
types of materials are released from

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.740 
types of materials are released from
those<00:01:47.610> grapes<00:01:47.850> depending<00:01:48.300> on<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.540> hard

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
those grapes depending on how hard

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.860 
those grapes depending on how hard
they're<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.110> squeezed<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.660> slow

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
they're being squeezed on so it's a slow

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.710 
they're being squeezed on so it's a slow
process<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.470> requires<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.160> lot<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.720> patience

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
process that requires a lot of patience

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.740 
process that requires a lot of patience
but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> reward<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.270> huge<00:01:57.450> because

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but I think the reward is huge because

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.570 
but I think the reward is huge because
again<00:01:58.170> we're<00:01:58.320> fractionating<00:01:59.010> things<00:01:59.220> out<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
again we're fractionating things out and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.580 
again we're fractionating things out and
we're<00:01:59.700> getting<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.300> pieces<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:01.380> put

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we're getting the right pieces to put

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.370 
we're getting the right pieces to put
into<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:02.370> appropriate<00:02:02.730> spot<00:02:03.330> there<00:02:03.990> comes<00:02:04.230> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
into an appropriate spot there comes a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
into an appropriate spot there comes a
point<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:04.800> we<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.100> feel<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:06.120> we're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
point when we don't feel that what we're

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
point when we don't feel that what we're
getting<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.660> here<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.680> mass<00:02:08.130> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
getting out of here out of that mass is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.490 
getting out of here out of that mass is
useful<00:02:08.760> and<00:02:09.180> at<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.930> point<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.290> stop

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
useful and at that point we stop

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.040 
useful and at that point we stop
pressing<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.850> may<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.210> about<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
pressing it so we may get about four

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.820 
pressing it so we may get about four
different<00:02:13.320> fractions<00:02:14.060> or<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.180> many<00:02:15.300> as<00:02:15.510> four

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
different fractions or as many as four

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.650 
different fractions or as many as four
but<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:16.980> remarkable<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.270> train

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
but it is remarkable when I train

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
but it is remarkable when I train
somebody<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.140> operate<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.650> press<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:19.950> just

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
somebody to operate this press and just

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.460 
somebody to operate this press and just
remind<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:21.060> you've<00:02:21.240> got<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:22.140> be

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
remind them to be you've got to be

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.830 
remind them to be you've got to be
patient<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.090> believe<00:02:24.450> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
patient they don't really believe that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.870 
patient they don't really believe that
things<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.740> gonna<00:02:25.830> change<00:02:25.920> radically<00:02:26.460> at

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
things are gonna change radically at

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.760 
things are gonna change radically at
different<00:02:27.210> points<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.530> it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
different points and it's just it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.650 
different points and it's just it's
fascinating<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> surprise<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.420> their

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
fascinating to see the surprise on their

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.660 
fascinating to see the surprise on their
faces<00:02:30.870> when<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:32.070> these<00:02:32.220> points<00:02:32.430> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
faces when they do see these points and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.000 
faces when they do see these points and
the<00:02:32.760> action<00:02:33.030> recognise<00:02:33.510> them

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
the action recognise them

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.380 
the action recognise them
it<00:02:34.400> seems<00:02:34.610> like<00:02:34.760> we're<00:02:34.910> making<00:02:35.180> things<00:02:35.270> a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
it seems like we're making things a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.699 
it seems like we're making things a
little<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.599> complicated<00:02:35.810> than<00:02:36.380> we<00:02:36.500> should

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
little more complicated than we should

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.070 
little more complicated than we should
we<00:02:37.580> are<00:02:37.760> for<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.239> short<00:02:38.300> period<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.870> time

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
we are for a very short period of time

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.080 
we are for a very short period of time
but<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> actually<00:02:40.069> simplifies<00:02:40.580> life<00:02:40.819> later

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
but it actually simplifies life later

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
but it actually simplifies life later
and<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:42.140> think<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.849> really<00:02:44.300> wonderful

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and I think it's just a really wonderful

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.309 
and I think it's just a really wonderful
tool<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.950> very<00:02:46.099> powerful<00:02:46.280> tool<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:48.170> our

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
tool and very powerful tool in our

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.770 
tool and very powerful tool in our
conditions
