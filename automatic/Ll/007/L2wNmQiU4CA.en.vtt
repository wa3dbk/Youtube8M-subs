00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
extra power cord so I have mine run up

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
extra power cord so I have mine run up
to<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> top<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.049> cabinets<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.400> on

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to the top of my cabinets there it's on

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.330 
to the top of my cabinets there it's on
just<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.479> color<00:01:15.750> right<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.260> will<00:01:16.890> cycle

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
just one color right now will cycle

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.100 
just one color right now will cycle
through<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> colors<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.070> blue<00:01:23.310> there

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
through the colors get your blue there

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
through the colors get your blue there
they're<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.470> top<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.890> cabinets

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
they're just on top of my cabinets

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
they're just on top of my cabinets
reflecting<00:01:27.030> off<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> ceiling<00:01:28.310> green<00:01:30.229> I'll

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
reflecting off the ceiling green I'll

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.260 
reflecting off the ceiling green I'll
actually<00:01:31.500> change<00:01:32.070> colors<00:01:34.159> slowly

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually change colors slowly

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.859 
actually change colors slowly
medium-fast<00:01:38.060> goes<00:01:39.060> into<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.680> color<00:01:41.270> dims<00:01:42.270> get

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
medium-fast goes into one color dims get

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.710 
medium-fast goes into one color dims get
real<00:01:43.140> bright<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:45.890> does<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.310> again

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
real bright and then does all that again

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.700 
real bright and then does all that again
fast<00:01:48.720> slow

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
fast slow

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760 
fast slow
that's<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.220> pulse<00:01:51.170> then<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.590> actual

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that's a pulse then you have your actual

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.830 
that's a pulse then you have your actual
sound<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.729> here

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.140 

you're<00:01:57.380> white<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.010> then<00:01:58.729> kind<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.060> an

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
off-white it doesn't really looks kind

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.230 
off-white it doesn't really looks kind
of<00:02:02.330> blue<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.750> here<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.350> not<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:04.240> kind

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
of blue on here but it's not it's kind

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.330 
of blue on here but it's not it's kind
of<00:02:05.270> an<00:02:05.390> off-white<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.930> person<00:02:06.380> then<00:02:06.740> back<00:02:07.009> here

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
of an off-white in person then back here

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.690 
of an off-white in person then back here
regular<00:02:08.000> color<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.590> only<00:02:09.830> thing<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.610> I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
regular color the only thing that I

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.410 
regular color the only thing that I
don't<00:02:10.759> like<00:02:11.209> about<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:13.090> when<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.209> have

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
don't like about this is when you have

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.280 
don't like about this is when you have
it<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.720> cycling<00:02:15.470> mode<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.720> find<00:02:18.020> one<00:02:18.260> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
it on cycling mode and you find one that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.030 
it on cycling mode and you find one that
you<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.650> if<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.640> go<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.880> pause<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
you like if you go to pause it if you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.660 
you like if you go to pause it if you
hit<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> pause<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:24.620> stops<00:02:25.069> there<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.550> it's

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
hit the pause it stops there like it's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.910 
hit the pause it stops there like it's
supposed<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.970> it'll<00:02:26.209> pause<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.560> hit<00:02:27.709> pause

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
supposed to it'll pause if you hit pause

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
supposed to it'll pause if you hit pause
again<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:29.390> would<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.080> would<00:02:30.260> in

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
again you would think that it would in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.949 
again you would think that it would in
essence<00:02:30.739> play<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.360> doesn't<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.900> have

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
essence play it but it doesn't you have

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.070 
essence play it but it doesn't you have
to<00:02:33.110> go<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.410> next<00:02:33.739> mode<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.910> keep<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.720> doing

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
to go to the next mode and keep on doing

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.900 
to go to the next mode and keep on doing
that<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:37.100> right<00:02:37.340> now<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.580> modes

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
that and just like right now the modes

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.559 
that and just like right now the modes
are<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.239> again<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.200> we'll<00:02:39.410> hit<00:02:39.530> pause<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
are going again so we'll hit pause and

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.380 
are going again so we'll hit pause and
