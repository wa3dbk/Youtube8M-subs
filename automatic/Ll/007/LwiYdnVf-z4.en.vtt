00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.459
 dr now let's talk about positions to use this one the fighting position 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.139
 I prefer to use the boxing position like that of Western boxing 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.910
 you will have to maintain yourself in five years to go out with your weight well 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 distributed with your arm armed back you must always maintain 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.030
 armed backwards we feel that you see a police officer with his 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.520
 pistol or five special equipped members with a subsidy always 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.190
 maintain the human barrier it happens the same with hillsides one would 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.010
 always armed backwards and that because the person will only be able to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.540
 you remove tears these arrive in American jails a lot 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.649
 prisoners who will return to the streets to commit crimes 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.120
 learn this site in prisons to position like this the mother of a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.949
 child warns in case he should push or throw a shot of 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.909
 fist seven other vincent matthey behind once ready you attack 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.600
 ray with your knife 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.870
 if the rival of you grab you can always pulled back she will 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 also very difficult of you armies if you attack quickly you 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 carry your hand backwards hold your center of gravity and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.580
 this one will be the correct position some people want to maintain the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 hillside here to drink and like that it is almost impossible to tear them 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.440
 money then you can attack like this to parents but keeping 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 always the position of the armed arms and the guard 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.520
 now my workout buddy has teased and you will see 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 the importance of maintaining the correct position 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.290
 I can defend myself to hit him and he can not grab my knife 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.970
 if trying to take my knife I can push it with his hands and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.910
 attacked him with the other
