00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
really good job let's start with the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.300 
really good job let's start with the
original<00:01:16.650> Metroid<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.119> Metroid<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.900> NES

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
millions sold and honestly I wasn't

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
millions sold and honestly I wasn't
really<00:01:26.009> even<00:01:26.159> looking<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> remake<00:01:27.330> until

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
really even looking for a remake until

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
really even looking for a remake until
they<00:01:28.200> made<00:01:28.640> metroid<00:01:29.640> zero<00:01:29.670> mission<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
could almost make the argument this is a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.590 
could almost make the argument this is a
reboot<00:01:36.869> remake<00:01:37.500> remaster<00:01:38.250> whatever<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.329> this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.780 
raider right I play this when it first
came<00:02:11.610> out

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
came out

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.020 
came out
it<00:02:13.030> blew<00:02:13.269> me<00:02:13.300> away<00:02:14.190> as<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> matter<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.519> fact<00:02:15.730> at

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it blew me away as a matter of fact at

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.110 
it blew me away as a matter of fact at
the<00:02:16.209> time<00:02:16.450> at<00:02:16.930> Sierra<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:18.310> were<00:02:18.580> getting<00:02:19.000> into

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the time at Sierra we were getting into

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.750 
the time at Sierra we were getting into
the<00:02:19.540> hardware<00:02:19.870> business<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.769> made<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.220> 3d

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the hardware business and we made a 3d

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880 
the hardware business and we made a 3d
accelerator<00:02:22.209> called<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.629> screamin<00:02:23.080> 3d<00:02:23.349> it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
accelerator called the screamin 3d it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.430 
accelerator called the screamin 3d it
was<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> rendition<00:02:24.280> video<00:02:25.120> card<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.140> at<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
was a rendition video card and so at the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.979 
was a rendition video card and so at the
time<00:02:26.650> when<00:02:26.769> this<00:02:26.830> came<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:28.599> could<00:02:28.780> apply

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
time when this came out you could apply

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.479 
time when this came out you could apply
the<00:02:29.080> rendition<00:02:29.680> patch<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.430> they

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
the rendition patch to this and they

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.970 
the rendition patch to this and they
would<00:02:30.670> use<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.330> 3d<00:02:31.780> accelerator<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.500> smooth

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
would use the 3d accelerator to smooth

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740 
would use the 3d accelerator to smooth
out<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.610> textures<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.299> also<00:02:34.540> make<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
out the the textures and also make the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.850 
out the the textures and also make the
the<00:02:35.489> polygons<00:02:36.489> much<00:02:36.970> better

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the polygons much better

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.440 
the polygons much better
fantastic<00:02:38.860> game<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.819> wasn't<00:02:40.090> perfect

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
fantastic game but it wasn't perfect

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.809 
fantastic game but it wasn't perfect
right<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:40.989> at<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.739> time<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.549> really

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
right because at the time we really

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.850 
right because at the time we really
hadn't<00:02:43.120> worked<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.470> controllers<00:02:44.470> like

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
hadn't worked out controllers like

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.729 
hadn't worked out controllers like
controlling<00:02:45.310> 3d<00:02:45.959> characters<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.620> screen

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
controlling 3d characters on the screen

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.860 
controlling 3d characters on the screen
so<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.700> original<00:02:49.060> had<00:02:49.209> those<00:02:49.329> kind<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.569> tank

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
so the original had those kind of tank

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.849 
so the original had those kind of tank
controls<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.730> annoying<00:02:52.769> but<00:02:53.769> we

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
controls really really annoying but we

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.440 
controls really really annoying but we
didn't<00:02:54.069> know<00:02:54.129> at<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.280> time<00:02:54.370> right<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.000> was<00:02:55.090> it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
didn't know at the time right it was it

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.250

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
back and reimagined the the early life

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.099 
back and reimagined the the early life
of<00:03:59.859> Laura<00:04:00.220> Croft<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:01.269> again<00:04:01.660> this<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:01.959> great

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
of Laura Croft and again this is great

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.470 
of Laura Croft and again this is great
it's<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:03.099> didn't<00:04:03.340> try<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.639> be<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> remake

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
it's like it didn't try to be a remake

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.659 
it's like it didn't try to be a remake
it<00:04:04.720> was<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> reboot<00:04:05.319> it's<00:04:05.530> like<00:04:05.650> ok<00:04:05.980> let's

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
it was a reboot it's like ok let's

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.960 
it was a reboot it's like ok let's
rethink<00:04:06.940> all<00:04:07.389> this<00:04:07.599> how<00:04:08.440> can<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:08.859> how<00:04:09.760> can<00:04:09.790> we

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
rethink all this how can we how can we

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.530 
rethink all this how can we how can we
retell<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.230> story<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.489> new<00:04:12.669> way<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.180> again

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
retell that story in a new way and again

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.330 
retell that story in a new way and again
I<00:04:13.930> was<00:04:14.169> really<00:04:14.379> happy<00:04:14.530> with<00:04:14.739> this<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:15.069> mean<00:04:15.190> I

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
I was really happy with this I mean I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.009 
I was really happy with this I mean I
was<00:04:15.489> skeptical<00:04:16.000> first<00:04:16.269> it's<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.630> don't

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
was skeptical first it's like I don't

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.779 
was skeptical first it's like I don't
know<00:04:17.199> but<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:17.949> think<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.220> needed<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.489> be<00:04:18.549> done

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
know but I think it needed to be done

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.750 
know but I think it needed to be done
you<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.329> I'm<00:04:19.660> really<00:04:20.019> happy<00:04:20.139> with<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
you know I'm really happy with it

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.659 
you know I'm really happy with it
same<00:04:21.760> thing<00:04:21.940> with<00:04:22.090> some<00:04:22.330> movies<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:24.430> one<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
same thing with some movies the one that

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.390 
same thing with some movies the one that
comes<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:25.000> mind

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
comes to mind

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.270 
comes to mind
is<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.880> Star<00:04:26.180> Trek<00:04:26.389> reboot<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.229> thought<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.190> was

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
is the Star Trek reboot I thought it was

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.860 
is the Star Trek reboot I thought it was
really<00:04:28.430> great<00:04:28.610> they<00:04:28.940> acknowledge<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.690> old

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
really great they acknowledge the old

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.939 
really great they acknowledge the old
universe<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:31.389> also<00:04:32.389> had<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.870> fresh<00:04:33.350> energy

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
universe and also had this fresh energy

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.749 
universe and also had this fresh energy
to<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.310> franchise<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:37.340> then<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.580> also

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
to that franchise so but then you also

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.900 
to that franchise so but then you also
asked<00:04:38.240> about<00:04:38.360> music<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:40.370> has<00:04:40.520> been<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.699> little

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
asked about music this has been a little

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.490 
asked about music this has been a little
bit<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.270> sticking<00:04:41.660> point<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:41.990> me<00:04:42.229> lately

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
bit of a sticking point for me lately

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.560 
bit of a sticking point for me lately
because<00:04:42.979> I've<00:04:43.250> recently<00:04:43.639> gotten<00:04:44.060> into

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
because I've recently gotten into

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.360 
because I've recently gotten into
Spotify<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:46.720> it's<00:04:47.720> interesting<00:04:48.080> because

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
Spotify and it's interesting because

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.379 
Spotify and it's interesting because
some<00:04:49.370> old<00:04:49.940> albums<00:04:50.479> have<00:04:51.350> been<00:04:52.150> remastered<00:04:53.150> or

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
some old albums have been remastered or

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.730 
some old albums have been remastered or
remade<00:04:53.900> by<00:04:54.410> these<00:04:54.830> old<00:04:55.190> bands<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:57.350> Reed<00:04:57.590> I

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
remade by these old bands and the Reed I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.110 
remade by these old bands and the Reed I
understand<00:04:58.280> why<00:04:58.400> they<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.940> but

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
understand why they do that but

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.850 
understand why they do that but
basically<00:04:59.449> they<00:04:59.510> take<00:04:59.690> these<00:04:59.810> old<00:05:00.110> songs<00:05:00.380> and

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
basically they take these old songs and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.270 
basically they take these old songs and
they<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:01.820> create<00:05:02.690> them<00:05:02.840> new<00:05:02.990> for<00:05:03.229> today<00:05:03.320> now

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
they they create them new for today now

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.560 
they they create them new for today now
the<00:05:04.340> reason<00:05:04.789> why<00:05:04.910> they<00:05:05.090> do<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.539> I

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
the reason why they do that and I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.870 
the reason why they do that and I
understand<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.199> because<00:05:06.340> they<00:05:07.340> don't<00:05:07.550> own<00:05:07.850> the

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
understand is because they don't own the

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.689 
understand is because they don't own the
master<00:05:08.570> recordings<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.560> those<00:05:09.919> those<00:05:10.430> old

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
master recordings of those those old

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.420 
master recordings of those those old
songs<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:11.810> essentially<00:05:12.770> these<00:05:13.010> record

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
songs and so essentially these record

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.800 
songs and so essentially these record
labels<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.090> masters<00:05:14.449> and<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:14.690> they<00:05:14.780> just

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
labels on the masters and so they just

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.050 
labels on the masters and so they just
keep<00:05:15.110> re<00:05:15.350> releasing<00:05:15.889> it<00:05:16.010> on<00:05:16.160> new<00:05:16.400> formats<00:05:16.849> like

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
keep re releasing it on new formats like

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.420 
keep re releasing it on new formats like
digital<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.780> streaming<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:19.070> artist

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
digital and streaming and the artist

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.450 
digital and streaming and the artist
gets<00:05:19.699> a<00:05:19.849> fraction<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.720> royalty<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:21.800> that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
gets a fraction of that royalty and that

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.730 
gets a fraction of that royalty and that
seems<00:05:22.729> unfair<00:05:23.120> especially<00:05:23.599> after<00:05:24.080> 30<00:05:24.349> or<00:05:24.500> 40

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
seems unfair especially after 30 or 40

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.159 
seems unfair especially after 30 or 40
years<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:26.060> what<00:05:26.330> they<00:05:26.479> do<00:05:26.539> is<00:05:26.810> they<00:05:26.900> go<00:05:27.020> back

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
years so what they do is they go back

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.629 
years so what they do is they go back
into<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:27.470> studio<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.830> they<00:05:27.949> try<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.190> recreate

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
into the studio and they try to recreate

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.860 
into the studio and they try to recreate
the<00:05:28.910> magic<00:05:29.260> but<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:31.610> often<00:05:31.940> just<00:05:32.479> does<00:05:32.690> not

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
the magic but it often just does not

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.490 
the magic but it often just does not
work<00:05:33.110> for<00:05:33.320> me

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
work for me

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.710 
work for me

the

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.770 
the
originals<00:06:37.700> probably<00:06:38.390> because<00:06:38.540> he<00:06:38.600> didn't

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
originals probably because he didn't

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.020 
originals probably because he didn't
lose<00:06:38.900> his<00:06:39.080> voice<00:06:39.260> and<00:06:39.650> he's<00:06:40.100> such<00:06:40.250> a<00:06:40.280> master<00:06:40.850> at

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
lose his voice and he's such a master at

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.530 
lose his voice and he's such a master at
production<00:06:41.990> but<00:06:42.560> that<00:06:42.860> was<00:06:43.040> one<00:06:43.340> remake<00:06:44.270> of

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
production but that was one remake of

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.930 
production but that was one remake of
original<00:06:45.380> 70's<00:06:45.980> music<00:06:46.100> that<00:06:46.490> actually<00:06:46.640> is

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
original 70's music that actually is

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.840 
original 70's music that actually is
probably<00:06:47.660> better<00:06:47.960> than<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.320> original<00:06:48.740> so

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
probably better than the original so
