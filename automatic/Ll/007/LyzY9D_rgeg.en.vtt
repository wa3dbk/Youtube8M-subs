00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
okay it's just about filled with wood

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.240 
okay it's just about filled with wood
yesterday<00:00:09.520> I<00:00:09.549> made<00:00:09.880> a<00:00:09.940> burn<00:00:10.540> and<00:00:11.010> these<00:00:12.010> are

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
yesterday I made a burn and these are

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.250 
yesterday I made a burn and these are
what<00:00:12.400> you<00:00:12.430> call<00:00:12.549> brands<00:00:13.510> they're<00:00:13.750> they're

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
what you call brands they're they're

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.500 
what you call brands they're they're
wood<00:00:14.500> that<00:00:14.709> just<00:00:15.010> the<00:00:15.490> heat<00:00:15.730> had<00:00:15.940> not<00:00:16.180> gotten

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
wood that just the heat had not gotten

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.880 
wood that just the heat had not gotten
to<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.840> center<00:00:17.110> of<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.289> wood<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.710> they

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
to the center of the wood and they

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.700 
to the center of the wood and they
aren't<00:00:18.130> just<00:00:18.180> made<00:00:19.180> in<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.420> charcoal<00:00:19.900> yet<00:00:20.140> no

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
aren't just made in the charcoal yet no

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:42.420 
aren't just made in the charcoal yet no
problem<00:00:39.600> okay<00:00:40.600> now<00:00:40.840> it's<00:00:41.050> time<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.710> build<00:00:42.250> the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
problem okay now it's time to build the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.180 
problem okay now it's time to build the
fire<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:43.329> this<00:00:43.449> is<00:00:43.629> critical<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.500> fire<00:00:44.829> is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
fire and this is critical the fire is

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.240 
fire and this is critical the fire is
built<00:00:45.489> on<00:00:45.760> top<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.539> wood<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.289> then<00:00:48.219> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
built on top of the wood and then the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.630 
built on top of the wood and then the
fire<00:00:48.579> burns<00:00:48.910> down<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.079> oxygen<00:00:50.829> it<00:00:51.399> comes

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
fire burns down and the oxygen it comes

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.090 
fire burns down and the oxygen it comes
up<00:00:51.850> through<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.180> bottom<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.660> barrel<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
up through the bottom of the barrel it's

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.220 
up through the bottom of the barrel it's
quite<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.399> different<00:00:54.820> design<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.449> what<00:00:55.629> most

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
quite a different design and what most

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:11.890 
quite a different design and what most
people<00:00:56.649> use

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.580 

kinda<00:01:12.470> windy<00:01:12.680> out<00:01:12.980> today<00:01:13.010> we'll<00:01:14.590> hopefully

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
kinda windy out today we'll hopefully

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:40.770 
kinda windy out today we'll hopefully
can<00:01:15.920> get<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.160> going<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.670> match<00:01:16.940> too

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:55.330 

it's<00:01:41.780> time<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.079> put<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.560> afterburner<00:01:54.340> now

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's time to put on the afterburner now

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.789 
it's time to put on the afterburner now
as<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.549> fire<00:01:55.819> starts<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.439> build<00:01:57.439> up<00:01:57.679> in

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
as that fire starts to build up in

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.840 
as that fire starts to build up in
intensity<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.810> heat<00:02:00.079> rising<00:02:00.710> what<00:02:01.219> night<00:02:01.549> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
intensity the heat rising what night the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.719 
intensity the heat rising what night the
gas<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.450> coming<00:02:02.630> off<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.110> wood<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.950> make<00:02:04.700> a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
gas is coming off the wood and make a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.999 
gas is coming off the wood and make a
fairly<00:02:05.270> clean<00:02:05.509> burn<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.319> you<00:02:06.439> have<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.830> have

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
fairly clean burn but you have to have

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.370 
fairly clean burn but you have to have
Drive<00:02:07.490> would<00:02:07.929> use<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.229> Sun<00:02:09.530> dry<00:02:10.429> your<00:02:10.640> wood<00:02:11.380> so

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
Drive would use the Sun dry your wood so

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.750 
Drive would use the Sun dry your wood so
you<00:02:12.500> don't<00:02:12.650> make<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:12.799> lot<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.069> smoke<00:02:13.459> you'll

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you don't make a lot of smoke you'll

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.030 
you don't make a lot of smoke you'll
also<00:02:13.970> increase<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.660> heel<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.989> charcoal<00:02:15.440> how

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
also increase your heel of charcoal how

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.650 
also increase your heel of charcoal how
long<00:02:16.220> does<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.400> typically<00:02:16.819> take<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.299> dry<00:02:17.480> your

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
long does it typically take to dry your

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.789 
long does it typically take to dry your
wood<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.730> drive<00:02:19.970> wood<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.840> Pennsylvania

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
wood to drive wood in Pennsylvania

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.500 
wood to drive wood in Pennsylvania
I<00:02:21.829> would<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.370> store<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.849> for<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.239> year

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
I would like to store it for one year

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.319 
I would like to store it for one year
under<00:02:23.930> cover<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.370> pile<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.970> wood<00:02:26.150> here

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
under cover I have a pile of wood here

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.080 
under cover I have a pile of wood here
by<00:02:26.450> my<00:02:26.630> sawmill<00:02:27.099> this<00:02:28.099> was<00:02:28.310> cut<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.819> summer

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
by my sawmill this was cut in the summer

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.020 
by my sawmill this was cut in the summer
we<00:02:29.360> had<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.900> much<00:02:30.079> rain<00:02:30.349> it<00:02:30.680> could<00:02:30.920> dry<00:02:31.190> out<00:02:31.220> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
we had so much rain it could dry out so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.610 
we had so much rain it could dry out so
I'm<00:02:32.299> going<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.079> it<00:02:33.230> under<00:02:33.440> cover

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
I'm going to have to put it under cover

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.069 
I'm going to have to put it under cover
and<00:02:35.769> here's<00:02:36.769> what's<00:02:36.980> happening<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:38.390> oxygen

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
and here's what's happening the oxygen

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:51.640 
and here's what's happening the oxygen
for<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.799> combustion<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.700> oxygen<00:02:50.650> ignites

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
for this combustion the oxygen ignites

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.190 
for this combustion the oxygen ignites
the<00:02:51.980> hot<00:02:52.280> gases<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.389> are<00:02:53.450> being<00:02:53.810> driven<00:02:53.989> off

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the hot gases that are being driven off

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.860 
the hot gases that are being driven off
the<00:02:54.380> wood<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.130> create<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.549> flaming<00:02:56.060> front<00:02:56.359> that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the wood and create a flaming front that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.309 
the wood and create a flaming front that
as<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.310> chart<00:02:58.639> as<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.329> wood<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.660> reduced<00:03:00.139> to

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
as the chart as the wood is reduced to

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.650 
as the chart as the wood is reduced to
charcoal<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.549> flaming<00:03:01.940> front<00:03:02.209> will<00:03:02.480> move

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
charcoal the flaming front will move

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.470 
charcoal the flaming front will move
down<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.380> barrel<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.910> will<00:03:05.120> come<00:03:05.299> out<00:03:05.450> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
down this barrel and will come out a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.059 
down this barrel and will come out a
little<00:03:05.690> bit<00:03:05.840> later<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.290> we'll<00:03:06.470> see<00:03:06.709> probably

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
little bit later and we'll see probably

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.640 
little bit later and we'll see probably
where<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.730> burn<00:03:07.940> are<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.440> because

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
where the burn are on this because

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
where the burn are on this because
that's<00:03:09.980> fresh<00:03:10.250> paint<00:03:10.579> new<00:03:10.880> barrel<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.630> I'll<00:03:12.350> be

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that's fresh paint new barrel so I'll be

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.729 
that's fresh paint new barrel so I'll be
able<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.799> tell<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.489> how<00:03:13.730> its<00:03:14.030> reacted<00:03:14.739> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
able to tell you how its reacted and

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.309 
able to tell you how its reacted and
then<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:17.120> control<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.840> amount<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.139> oxygen

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
then to control the amount of oxygen

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.470 
then to control the amount of oxygen
coming<00:03:18.920> in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
coming in

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.800 
coming in
we<00:03:20.020> use<00:03:20.849> this<00:03:21.849> plain<00:03:22.180> old<00:03:22.390> dirt<00:03:24.510> these<00:03:25.510> holes

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
we use this plain old dirt these holes

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.470 
we use this plain old dirt these holes
to<00:03:26.200> seal<00:03:26.500> them<00:03:26.769> should<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.430> fire<00:03:27.640> be<00:03:28.090> burning

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
to seal them should the fire be burning

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.350 
to seal them should the fire be burning
more<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.620> way<00:03:29.800> than<00:03:30.010> another<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:31.090> fire

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
more one way than another the fire

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.320 
more one way than another the fire
always<00:03:32.110> burns<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:33.099> where<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.459> oxygen<00:03:34.000> is

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
always burns to where the oxygen is

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:41.360 
always burns to where the oxygen is
coming<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.640> wind<00:03:36.970> today<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:38.140> fire

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.250 

so<00:03:42.370> once<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.120> fire<00:03:43.330> gets<00:03:43.599> down<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> those

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
so once the fire gets down to those

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.860 
so once the fire gets down to those
outlets<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.310> will<00:03:45.580> put<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> dirt<00:03:46.330> against<00:03:46.720> them

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
outlets I will put the dirt against them

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.289 
outlets I will put the dirt against them
and<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.590> will<00:03:47.799> force<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.370> fire<00:03:48.610> over<00:03:49.120> to

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
and that will force the fire over to

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.949 
and that will force the fire over to
this<00:03:49.540> side<00:03:49.870> where<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.349> oxygen<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:51.099> coming<00:03:51.340> in

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
this side where the oxygen is coming in

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.780 
this side where the oxygen is coming in
so<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.019> as<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.560> charcoal<00:03:54.069> burner<00:03:54.280> can

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
so you as the charcoal burner can

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.589 
so you as the charcoal burner can
control<00:03:55.269> how<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.260> gets<00:03:56.970> reacted<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.120> beside

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
control how it gets reacted in beside

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.830 
control how it gets reacted in beside
the<00:03:58.780> burner<00:03:59.549> and<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.880> don't<00:04:01.030> want<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.420> stick<00:04:01.599> my

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
the burner and I don't want to stick my

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.250 
the burner and I don't want to stick my
head<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.230> there<00:04:02.410> but<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.160> starting<00:04:04.260> real

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
head in there but it's starting real

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.729 
head in there but it's starting real
well

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
well

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.400 
well
this<00:04:06.069> will<00:04:06.280> take<00:04:06.549> about<00:04:06.819> two<00:04:07.540> hours<00:04:07.569> to<00:04:07.959> burn

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
this will take about two hours to burn

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.490 
this will take about two hours to burn
down<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.670> larger<00:04:10.150> barrels<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.989> 55-gallon

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
down the larger barrels the 55-gallon

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.809 
down the larger barrels the 55-gallon
drums<00:04:12.040> takes<00:04:12.340> about<00:04:12.459> three<00:04:12.940> hours<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.660> do<00:04:14.819> so

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
drums takes about three hours to do so

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.580 
drums takes about three hours to do so
let's<00:04:16.180> just<00:04:16.450> let<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.750> cook<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.989> while<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.500> we'll

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
let's just let it cook a while and we'll

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.199 
let's just let it cook a while and we'll
come<00:04:17.799> back<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.010> little<00:04:18.250> bit<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.609> see<00:04:18.910> how<00:04:19.030> it's

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
come back a little bit and see how it's

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.359 
come back a little bit and see how it's
doing
