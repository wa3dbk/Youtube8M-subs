completed to get that title yeah
no<00:02:01.100> let's<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:01.729> say<00:02:01.820> around<00:02:02.060> seven<00:02:02.390> get<00:02:02.689> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
no let's just say around seven get the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.149 
no let's just say around seven get the
round<00:02:02.960> seven<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.409> get<00:02:03.530> seven<00:02:03.829> prestige

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
round seven when you get seven prestige

round seven when you get seven prestige
and<00:02:04.490> get<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:05.000> think<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.509> ranked<00:02:06.320> four

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and get to I think it's like ranked four

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.820 
and get to I think it's like ranked four
or<00:02:06.829> whatever<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.509> round<00:02:09.410> seven

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
or whatever so you get the round seven
