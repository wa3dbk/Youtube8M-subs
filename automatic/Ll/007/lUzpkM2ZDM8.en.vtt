00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.200
 [Music] 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 ah 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello this is style we are already 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.759
 erika brave and today I will teach them to 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.950
 how to make easy and quick delineation 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.050
 I never pass them to see friends who always 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.820
 but they always have splendid eyes 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.439
 and to think that we would not know why 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.210
 where to start in this video I'm going to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.130
 teach several tips to make you 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.239
 different types of outline and stay 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.850
 divine let's start this time let's 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.260
 be using a gel eyeliner and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:45.050
 a very fine brush and also in a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.120
 tip termination if they do not have 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.730
 gel eyeliner some could do 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.760
 is to use a shadow that is very very 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.650
 We wet the brush with a little 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.010
 water and we use it 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.170
 well let's start with the delineated 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.590
 traditional now to make a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.050
 delineated more dramatic I bring this 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:11.400
 little secret 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.420
 we go a piece of tape and we put it 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.420
 in the end 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 we can do it we can place it in 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 the inclination that we want if we 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.689
 we want very raised 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.790
 we put it like that in the field that 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.200
 we want our line to be a little 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.160
 more lying down how is it going to be this time 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.810
 we place in this part is very simple 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.840
 keep making small lines 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 or one attached to the other 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.120
 right where the basin ends 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.890
 and the only thing 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.230
 [Music] 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.769
 we had already done 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.769
 [Music] 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:10.390
 trump a transformation that we can 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 add to this delineated 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.500
 is to extend 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.440
 A line 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.140
 the lower eyelid only in one 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 edge and we paste it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.330
 to the corner of the top 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.880
 [Music] 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 we apply a white eyeliner on the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.250
 water line this will make your eyes 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.460
 see much bigger and more striking what 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.679
 it seems to them 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.679
 [Music] 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.400
 get involved in sharing this technique 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.230
 with you now that you already know delineates your 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.690
 eyes in different ways you can try 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.880
 between one and another until you find the one 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.440
 better highlight your beautiful eyes I hope 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.570
