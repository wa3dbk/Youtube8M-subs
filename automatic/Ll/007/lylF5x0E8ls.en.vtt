00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.969
 Now that we have a meal, we drink a cup of most of the tea . 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:15.639
 Not only after meals but also when I am tired now 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:21.820

 I do not know if you're drinking. 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:35.260
 But bumping is a bit like when our nose is stiff 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:38.290
 The neck is stiff and bulging up to the back of the head, or heavy on its shoulders 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.149
 It will be very helpful if you do this. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:49.110
 And if you drink the juice after drinking, the cancellation is good. 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:54.670
 It helps, like the juice or buckwheat tea , 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:00.489
 There are some acidic properties, and this is not the kind of car you always take 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:04.629
 Well, there is no big side effects, even though he put up for sale the car stuck that increase recovery 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:10.390
 Juneunde to really help direct air jikseu rain Fri 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:14.050
 It's like a wet heat, but it stretches out like a poison. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.120
 I can not get this product because I can not get fatigue on my muscles. 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.840
 If you like buckwheat tea, he always decodes it. 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.270
 roughness 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.620
 But I hope people who drink a lot of Asherrick drink 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 There is not much to decode in the play , 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.060
 A lot of people 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 I do not think you guys should do this. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.910
 And if you like green tea, which is indeed Can I really popularized in daily life 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.510
 If you continue to drink this green tea 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.500
 If your body is very cold and you are male 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.620
 As a result, weaken the control that so energetic 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 You can acorn up side effects. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:04.220
 Even if you like green tea , every few days, when you're bored for your guests 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.190
 But one thing that drinking a little bit this way opened five cups 6 cups a day 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.500
 It is not advisable to drink deserving 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 And now that you eat a lot of healthy food in a healthy addition to the usual drive 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.300
 I also want to think about red ginseng. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.920
 These things eat ginseng flavor of spirit, because now bent 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.720
 Because of the medicine 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.910
 When you eat, you need and you get smaller, so people live 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:37.880
 It's true that it gives me a lot of energy . 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:43.370
 And when I wrote a mixture of drugs , there was only one thing 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.420
 It works well when you write it , but it also has side effects when you drag it long 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.550
 can 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.680
 If you eat it, it will have side effects but there is no side effects of red ginseng . 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:59.540
 It is not true that you are thinking so much about ginseng. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.769
 But still a little pacified de term effects When taking it, I 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.799
 There are cases. 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:08.510
 It's been a long time since my face has been closed. 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:14.180
 Also, if you have something like a rash or something that has these side effects 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 I am so tired of these things, 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.049
 If you want to improve your body a lot 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:26.090
 That's when you want, and then you have my full break, now that Hong 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:29.690
 The prize is to eat something like food and then get tired again later 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 I think you should be able to manage it this way . 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:39.860
 After that, many of the same things are good, 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:44.570
 Yes but better than I Garlic tell everyone a little one hot property 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:49.970
 I think it would be better if you have those who have your body because you have it . 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:55.190
 Coffee And what most of the people love coffee, but that 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.549
 Coffee is tired rather than release the fatigue that coffee is actually our body 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:04.010
 It's a role that makes you forget it for a while. 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:10.459
 So how I should look rejuvenate my body when really tired so easy 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:15.110
 It just makes us forget fatigue so we can focus more on things. 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:20.419
 It's coffee that 's how it's played, so when it's tired, 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:26.300
 Do not add that to your day as you depend on coffee. 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:30.830
 10 minutes so even breathed a cumbersome released in this way should not be the one 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.120
 For these things, and coffee, sugar, lard month the Supreme again yiradeunji 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.169
 So that 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.300
 Oh, this is also're supposed to serve another useless flesh pot somehow so what 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:47.930
 Coffee is too often do not eat, do not drink is a drink later that this also 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.630
 I just want you to have a drink when I serve you, 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.199
 Sometimes I miss the coffee aroma. 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:05:00.650
 I would like you to do this as much as you are now. 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:04.639
 Drinking tea every day But if you drink well, you will get our life and relax. 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.470
 But if you go wrong, you can harm your neck. 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.470
 I hope you'll think about it once.
