00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.539
 impulse doctor Fred had returned to his inventor adducing tons of 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.720
 toxic waste 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.450
 that poisoned the purple tentacle made it more evil and with two arms 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.850
 to vary the louro model left the moral tentacle free 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.540

 inspector gadget and carlitos tevez that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.080
 started and studied medicine this is how the rest of the game is going to be 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.930
 we have three different timelines to solve the riddles 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 throughout history the latrines of the weather phase anti-load poa and winds 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.800
 hundred years in the past and the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.789
 see me in 200 years in the future from the present bernardo who has to help 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.930
 fred to get everything you need to re-use the machine 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.669
 time and use the latrines to send all the trincherillas of the present to 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.890
 future that to the past so that there are some who would like to see me can alter the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.789
 history and without any problem as if they were martíma clara and cuba there 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.819
 who has to change the history of the foundation of the Yankee empire playing 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.190
 with the lives of the founding fathers changing toothed uu 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.070
 murad flag to the night until the same constitution to solve the 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.939
 riddles throughout the story i 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.289
 Hermes has to use everything that is sent from the past to get away from a 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.530
 world conquered by the tentacles 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.650
 can not all this is still the timeline between the three 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.380
 characters that puts a sling back to the future something interesting 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.029
 from the future the doubts have to achieve impossible things for 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:19.149
 be able to go back to the present then 400 years ago how can someone alter 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:23.389
 in reality for those things to appear the first one is when washington 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.599
 part the false cereso and liberal attack was trapped in the little tree the 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.589
 design of the American flag that ends up being a tentacle for 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:37.059
 can use it as a costume 400 years later as was the custom of the time 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:41.839
 the day of the tentacle has a system of keys that allows you to access the 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.419
 game in the case of lucasarts was always done in a funny way and this time 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.249
 we get the valencia-r super salad-based battery that invented the fred 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.939
 edition every time we open the game 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.939
 it took many years since the last adventure in two dimensions 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.500
 for the most nostalgic the genre happened with the new generation of 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.879
 firefighters if they want the whole property a thousand per hour 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.409
 this will be a game 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.020
 fortunately the gumer community track refloating graphic adventures that 

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:15.939
 they thought losses in time as is the case of manigat mansion block or 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.729
 the unofficial continuations of montilla island we are going to say that they are 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.180
 great 0 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.860
 it's something 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.330
 all this talk about graphic adventure of a billion years ago makes you 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.649
 hit the viejozo 

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.840
 because you do not believe a little run for its dot-com place 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.280
 this project goes ahead according to Arctic lethargy in the tocoa carceleta 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.760
 euros 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.009
 and if you do not vote what you think 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:40.990

 the road runner explosion 

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.849
