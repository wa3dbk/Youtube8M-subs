00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
powered by three volts which means you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
volt and a half which means you can use

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.179 
volt and a half which means you can use
a<00:01:00.829> single<00:01:01.390> double-a<00:01:02.390> or<00:01:02.690> triple-a<00:01:03.050> battery<00:01:03.440> to

housing<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.789> mic<00:02:12.129> then<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.279> have<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
housing of the mic then you have to

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.080 
housing of the mic then you have to
connect<00:02:13.879> power<00:02:14.439> to<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.529> microphone<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.999> you

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
connect power to the microphone so you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.970 
connect power to the microphone so you
have<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.450> take

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
have to take

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.960 
have to take
a<00:02:18.069> clip<00:02:18.670> lead<00:02:18.909> to<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> plus<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.870> your<00:02:20.110> battery

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
a clip lead to the plus of your battery

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.690 
a clip lead to the plus of your battery
then<00:02:21.970> connect<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:23.080> one<00:02:23.530> end<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.519> two

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
then connect it to one end of the two

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.680 
then connect it to one end of the two
point<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.330> kilo<00:02:26.019> ohm<00:02:26.290> resistor<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
point two kilo ohm resistor then you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.050 
point two kilo ohm resistor then you
take<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> clip<00:02:29.260> lead<00:02:29.500> from<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> other<00:02:30.310> end<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
take a clip lead from the other end of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.039 
take a clip lead from the other end of
the<00:02:31.450> 2.2<00:02:31.989> k<00:02:32.560> resistor<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.840> connect<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
the 2.2 k resistor and you connect that

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.890 
the 2.2 k resistor and you connect that
to<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.799> other<00:02:36.010> terminal<00:02:36.459> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:38.459> mic

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to the other terminal on the mic

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.330 
to the other terminal on the mic
alright<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.379> mic<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.709> actually<00:02:42.160> now

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
alright so the mic is actually now

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.360 
alright so the mic is actually now
powered<00:02:42.819> but<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:44.140> some<00:02:44.470> philosophical

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
powered but like some philosophical

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
powered but like some philosophical
conundrum<00:02:45.579> we<00:02:46.150> cannot<00:02:46.450> hear<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.810> we<00:02:47.530> must<00:02:47.739> get

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
conundrum we cannot hear it we must get

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.990 
conundrum we cannot hear it we must get
it<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.190> hear<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.599> we<00:02:50.530> take<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.920> ground<00:02:51.280> from

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
it to hear so we take the ground from

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699 
it to hear so we take the ground from
our<00:02:52.150> audio<00:02:52.540> connection<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.170> amplifier

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
our audio connection to the amplifier

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.809 
our audio connection to the amplifier
and<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.579> connect<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.599> same-<00:02:56.819> terminal

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
and we connect it to the same- terminal

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.520 
and we connect it to the same- terminal
of<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.269> battery<00:03:00.359> then<00:03:01.359> we<00:03:01.569> connect<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.140> plus

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
of the battery then we connect the plus

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.979 
of the battery then we connect the plus
or<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:03.010> hot<00:03:03.310> connection<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.269> our<00:03:04.359> amplifier

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
or the hot connection to our amplifier

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.539 
or the hot connection to our amplifier
the<00:03:05.260> one<00:03:05.379> that<00:03:05.500> goes<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.829> tip<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.280> plug

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
the one that goes to the tip of the plug

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.750 
the one that goes to the tip of the plug
we<00:03:07.060> connect<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:07.900> end<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:09.129> little

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
we connect it to one end of this little

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.680 
we connect it to one end of this little
capacitor<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:12.190> other<00:03:12.430> end<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
capacitor and the other end of the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.000 
capacitor and the other end of the
little<00:03:13.900> capacitor<00:03:14.670> goes<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:17.170> output<00:03:17.379> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
little capacitor goes to the output the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.530 
little capacitor goes to the output the
hot<00:03:18.340> signal<00:03:18.879> of<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.750> mic<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.970> yes<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.329> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
hot signal of the mic so yes it is a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900 
hot signal of the mic so yes it is a
mess<00:03:22.870> but<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.859> we've<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.519> lost<00:03:24.730> a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
mess but and we've just lost a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.050 
mess but and we've just lost a
connection<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.799> if<00:03:27.040> we<00:03:27.220> can<00:03:27.340> keep<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.730> hanging

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
connection but if we can keep it hanging

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.729 
connection but if we can keep it hanging
together<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.690> moment<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.169> turn<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.590> our

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
together for a moment and turn on our

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.430 
together for a moment and turn on our
amp<00:03:30.299> we<00:03:31.299> should<00:03:31.540> be<00:03:31.720> rewarded

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
amp we should be rewarded

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.830 
amp we should be rewarded
by<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.680> sound<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:34.120> microphone<00:03:36.840> obviously

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
by the sound of the microphone obviously

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.479 
by the sound of the microphone obviously
this<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.829> going<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.040> hold<00:03:39.280> together

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
this is not going to hold together

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.520 
this is not going to hold together
through<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> recording<00:03:40.510> session<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.139> you're

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
through a recording session and you're

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.229 
through a recording session and you're
now<00:03:41.680> going<00:03:41.919> to<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.340> put<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.700> little<00:03:42.940> work

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
now going to have to put a little work

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.470 
now going to have to put a little work
into<00:03:43.620> figuring<00:03:44.620> out<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.919> packaging<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:46.239> this

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
into figuring out the packaging but this

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.819 
into figuring out the packaging but this
shows<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:48.549> feedback<00:03:49.440> how<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.500> basic

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
shows with feedback how the basic

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.880 
shows with feedback how the basic
concept<00:03:51.519> works
