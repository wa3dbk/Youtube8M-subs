00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.160
 hello everyone today I bring you some tricks 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.140
 for dead island riptide and good tricks 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.090
 rather they are a few details 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.369
 little things that are in the game some 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.439
 small flaws and good in this part of 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 Here on the map let's do it again 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.880
 the teleportation that makes us the table 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.100
 magical that is not a small table there 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.780
 that is throughout the game and some 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
 this teleport is here 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.129
 you just have to jump on top of 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.379
 good to try to jump on the table 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.020
 or against the table and sometimes it's not 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.430
 teleporting below but not below 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.719
 we are interested in what interests us is that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.809
 pull us up is worth how you are 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.249
 seeing here that good is more a detail 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 what else will we stay up here 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.309
 and little else because we can not do anything 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.230
 is more than anything the fact that the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 paranoia not that you jump against a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 table and teleports to the roof of the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.309
 house does nothing but the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 paranoia that makes more for the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 utility that has good now too 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.369
 you are going to see a couple of details more good 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.470
 some more faults there are for the game 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 ok I was around here walking already 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 As I walked through here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 the part this of water is worth this would be 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259
 the end of the map I did not stick by 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 here to the wall and I saw that there was a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.530
 small graphics error here is worth 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.370
 just as I was progressing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 everything was disappearing 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.790
 ok this is not any hack or anything this 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.930
 it is the normal original game 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.180
 do not think it's anything weird 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 it's just a graphics error 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.580
 As it begins to load 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.620
 as if I was loading it and it will stop loading it 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.300
 something I do not know but only at this point of 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 here it's worth the back of the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.220
 everything where is the water we told him the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 last never where are the two the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.310
 two stones those streets in the middle do not 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.510
 two how to say the mountains rocks or the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.790
 weird stuff is to the pipes ok not half 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.430
 good and more than anything is a small 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.320
 detail and now this here that was that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.020
 I was walking around here I started 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.410
 fight there with some zombies and I saw that one 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.660
 I do not know how he got inside the mountain 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.070
 here I am killing this but it is the one 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 is the left is worth the one that 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.620
 I mean there's just a zombie 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.660
 in there as you are seeing and is 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.210
 outside the barrier that is to say there is 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.770
 a small transparent barrier there and 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.810
 he can not come for me not for much 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.460
 I approached what the rock is not 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.170
 I would have to be very close so that I 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.930
 Diera is out there walking, it's as if 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.640
 it was off the map it's worth it and out there 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.170
 there's the zombie and it's just another 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 detail is better some of the failures 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.650
 that I have been finding myself and little else 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.790
 so well it was just this 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.650
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.060
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.360
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360
