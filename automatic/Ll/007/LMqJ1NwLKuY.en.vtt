 how to mount faucets 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.840
 Thermostatic radiator level 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.240
 difficulty a hammer goes up instead 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.240
 manually operated faucet a model 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 thermostatic head can be used 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 the comfort temperature of each 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.439
 piece taking into account the contributions 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 free of heat like the sun on 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 a glass surface 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.480
 you will need a faucet 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 Thermostatic Pata Weld Seal 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.309
 possibly a connection bring 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.309
 cUNEO 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.399
 equip yourself with a wrench 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:51.239
 screwdriver from a cutter of a saw to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 metals of a key sipan draining the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.530
 water circuit of the facility is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.109
 necessary before disassembling the old 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 robin and if the radiator is a dairy 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.559
 you can settle for a drain 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.110
 partial 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.570
 otherwise we would open the drain valve 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 the boiler and also opened the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 radiator bleeders the highest the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.680
 time needed to purge lives 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.409
 it is then the crews who ensure the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 connection between the radiator and the old 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.280
 tap this conical fitting nut 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 is screwed on the thread of the tap 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 clear a little old robin and in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.470
 tugging lightly on the pipe for 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.420
 dismiss 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 do not hesitate to remove 1 or 2 necklace 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.189
 wall mounting the pipe for him 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.650
 give more play lives that's 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.170
 then the body of the faucet for the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 separated from the threaded fittings of the hose 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 heating 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.759
 disassembly of the report to wear conic 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.649
 may vary from model to model 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.590
 some have a sipan print 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.659
 inside the fitting and disassembles 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 with a corresponding key 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.840
 others own two high zerg 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.399
 placed in vis-Ã -vis that requires employees 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 an annie key full of faucets 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.810
 thermostats often have the same 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.870
 dimensions and ratio as models 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.060
 classic but it's good to check 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.700
 especially on an old radiator 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.040
 according to the existing configuration you 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.250
 have to choose between a right faucet where 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.099
 to go cairo the thermostatic head that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.770
 is fixed on it has a bulb 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.170
 which acts on a water point located in 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.540
 the body of the faucet and thus regulate the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 flow of water 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 if you replace the intake connection 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.590
 radiator technique slightly streaked 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.170
 the parade with a saw blade or 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.989
 cutter to favor the eighth of the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.940
 tow coat the thread of the new 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 ratio of the value of half a walnut 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 dough in June then roll up three rounds of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.080
 of course spinning by turning in the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.330
 clockwise 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:08.069
 then put a small dose of pasta 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:10.050
 deputy and vice and their agreement garnish 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.560
 the threading of water inlet fittings 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.810
 of pata joints and filasse put 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.909
 a small amount of paws before coming 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.580
 screw on the body of the new 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.440
 tap finally two faces 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.099
 stop right in front of the fitting 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.560
 conical of the radiator screw the nut of the 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.500
 conical fitting on the body of the new 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.540
 tap the tightness is ensured by the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.519
 tapered parts of both pieces without 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:45.209
 seal present the thermostatic head 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.280
 well in front of the needle push towards the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.220
 tap one hand and the other tight 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.120
 the ring which ensures the fixation on 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.530
 some models 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.500
 the fixation is done by an click taj 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.459
 adjust the thermostatic head by placing 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.810
 the maximum opening next to the index 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.110
 filled your circuit again 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.440
 heating then purge to eliminate 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.959
 possible air pockets the caches 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.970
 radiator curtain shelves can 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.850
 to thwart the proper functioning of the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.549
 thermostatic head to the needs 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 there are models with bulbs and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.919
 remote control 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 act on the thermostatic head a 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.660
 simple intervention it allows 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.090
 to improve comfort while achieving 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.810
 energy savings a question a
