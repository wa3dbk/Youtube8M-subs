00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.059
 goodbye but today it is very difficult 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.360
 present something new something 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 that is not already present on youtube that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.939
 it is not already present on dvd cd books 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.789
 various electronics I had thought of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.570
 introduce yourself to games even maybe 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.469
 with original player comments 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 worried in the clash but unfortunately 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.620
 those that I like with interesting 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.550
 they are already present in looking then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 flipping through books my possession 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 is played from the states and occupied the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.140
 position you see illustrated in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:04.159
 diagram this study says white 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.630
 moves and draws the idea promotes stolen 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 your own enter this position 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 just out of curiosity the ok to analyze 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 from the statistical engines dared fritz 12 ho 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.840
 used fabrics 5 then jaxa it seems to me that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 none of these three statistical engines 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 after an hour he was able to find the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:39.720
 move that draws only defeats 5 as 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.439
 therefore possibility approved the move 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.380
 what a draw though strangely giving 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:53.180
 always advantage over black 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.369
 on a scale of one that we level the most 5 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.259
 more if for black if you want at least 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.179
 five but if prevented by others 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.070
 this position is completely in 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.070
 position that derives from the first move 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the others he followed it of course 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.740
 gives place to a pata even when yes 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 comes to the position 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.860
 final among chess engines 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 they insist that black is ahead 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.770
 the niqab is not decisive 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.620
 possibility for the diaries has already been done 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.460
 for all a mistake risks winning 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 the white one I will not say the solution of 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.130
 this of this little quiz 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 indeed of this great European quiz which 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.650
 use your own intuition 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.320
 statesmen with your abilities 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:56.320
 statistics because no engine 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320
 chess of a good future
