00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.120
 want to enjoy a xiaomi phone 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.160
 but you do not have enough money to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 you pay a mika hole 1.0 me not who 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 are the flagships of the Chinese giant 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.170
 here's their and a half 2 it's the entrance to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.750
 range of the Chinese brand that offers to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.960
 just about all the benefits of this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 brand at a ridiculous price ie 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 about 150 180 euros then the point 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 strong of this xiaomi phone is 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 obviously for its derisory price its 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.629
 pretty decent equipment to start with 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.219
 its screen a screen ip s definition hd 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 720p but that is largely sufficient 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.070
 for its diagonal of 4.7 inches a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 quadchanger processor from qualcomm 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.989
 1 last generation 64 bit then its 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 64- bit capabilities are not exploited 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 since his system is put him is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.159
 always in 32 bits but it is good 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.080
 of the mid-8 2.0 me system that does a little 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 the reputation of guillermis is a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.939
 system that strongly resembles 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.619
 apple system with the same colors 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.810
 pretty much the same graphic chart 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 it's very warm very pleasant to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.250
 look and very convenient to use 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.500
 also it's fluid for pretty much 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 all the apps on the other hand there 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
 will have to be very modest about the games 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.200
 video including video games in 3d that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.600
 turns quite slowly since the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 graphic circuit adreno 306 which is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 integrated into the phone's processor 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 is pretty powerless especially on a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.689
 definition hd so stay modest on 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 video games in 3D but which are 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.320
 daily office applications 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.680
 it's very fluid and very pleasant to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.479
 use 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.850
 another strong point then it is the autonomy 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 smartphone that certainly does not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 miracle but who is very powerful 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 when the phone is idle and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.649
 when in use 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's about average autonomy 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.430
 is pretty good it looks like even for a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 phone at 150 euros 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.369
 last good point is the performance 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.829
 in pictures and video of the camera 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.780
 so his like sensor does not 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.000
 of miracle but it's pretty good for 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.530
 an entry-level smartphone that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.760
 triggers the photos fast enough 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.680
 are rather honest 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 so it's significantly lower in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.840
 terms of quality omitted 4 which is the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.560
 2 0 me flagship phone but that's 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.200
 absolutely correct 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.670
 just have to be pretty tolerant with 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.209
 the fairly poor performance in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.209
 low light 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.080
 the weak points of this smartphone 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.970
 it's his design that stays very 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.130
 classic so it's not high design 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 of range as we are used to seeing it 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.200
 at exo me it's a phone while 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.670
 plastic with a shell that has the merit 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.890
 not to score on your finger and to be 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.810
 rather pleasant to the touch but who 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.570
 remains plastic with a design all to 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.250
 common fact so actually it's not 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.920
 very nice but it's nice to watch 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.810
 it's nice to keep in last hand 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.730
 weak point is at the level of the 4g 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.350
 then this smartphone is compatible 4g 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.870
 but it is only compatible with 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.160
 the thousand mile frequency megahertz which him 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.540
 actually allows to work in case of 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.170
 I only have with the operator Bouygues 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.540
 and soon the free operator so useless 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.090
 to expect ranks of the 4g with sfr or 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.860
 orange on their and a half 2 it's a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 strong limitation but not too much 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.459
 disabling with regard to the price of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.489
 the device that stays between 150 and 180 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.489
 euros 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.060
 short their enemy's is rather a good 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.770
 case right now that said you 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.570
 advise to wait for version 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.250
 improved the rpt and half 2 that comes 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.040
 just out and this time 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.560
 is equipped with 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 storage and 2 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 long live what will allow to really 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.240
 increase the comfort of use of the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.240
 smartphone
