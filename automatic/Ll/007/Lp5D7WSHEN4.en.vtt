00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
Mercenaries I'll be showing off how to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920 
Mercenaries I'll be showing off how to
get<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.130> urban<00:00:17.520> chaos<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.359> map<00:00:18.510> everyone

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
get it in urban chaos the map everyone

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410 
get it in urban chaos the map everyone
should<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:21.000> showing<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.300> off<00:00:21.390> in

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
should have so I'm showing it off in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.970 
should have so I'm showing it off in
this<00:00:21.630> map<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.170> applies<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.619> everyone

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this map because it applies to everyone

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.700 
this map because it applies to everyone
that<00:00:23.100> owns<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.730> game<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.380> some<00:00:25.380> people<00:00:25.619> may

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that owns the game and some people may

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.019 
that owns the game and some people may
not<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> other<00:00:26.220> maps<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.910> may

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
not have the other maps because they may

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.279 
not have the other maps because they may
not<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.180> pre-ordered<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> same

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
not have pre-ordered it from the same

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
not have pre-ordered it from the same
place<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> urban<00:00:30.269> chaos<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.380> go-to<00:00:32.480> I'm

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
place so urban chaos is the go-to I'm

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120 
place so urban chaos is the go-to I'm
just<00:00:33.660> getting<00:00:33.899> her<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.290> way<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.950> going

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
just getting her out of my way I'm going

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
just getting her out of my way I'm going
to<00:00:35.160> start<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.520> collecting<00:00:36.059> some<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to start off by collecting some of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
to start off by collecting some of the
time<00:00:36.840> crystals<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.489> enough

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
time crystals so that I can have enough

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
time crystals so that I can have enough
time<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> show<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.680> because<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> does

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
time to show this off because it does

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.709 
time to show this off because it does
take<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.520> time<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:41.940> hopefully<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.390> too

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
take a bit of time but hopefully not too

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
take a bit of time but hopefully not too
much<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.739> depends<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> luck<00:00:45.480> but

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
much it all depends a bit of luck but

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
much it all depends a bit of luck but
for<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> most<00:00:46.770> part<00:00:46.860> skill<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> timing<00:00:48.170> now

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
for the most part skill and timing now

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.779 
for the most part skill and timing now
the<00:00:49.230> trick<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> spawning<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> optional<00:00:50.610> boss

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the trick to spawning the optional boss

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
the trick to spawning the optional boss
is<00:00:51.030> counter<00:00:51.539> kills<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.739> roughly<00:00:53.340> 15<00:00:54.000> I'm

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
is counter kills you need roughly 15 I'm

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
is counter kills you need roughly 15 I'm
pretty<00:00:55.050> sure<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.379> 15<00:00:55.770> I'll<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> counter

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pretty sure it is 15 I'll keep a counter

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.170 
pretty sure it is 15 I'll keep a counter
up<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> screen<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.850> more<00:01:00.000> easily

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
up on the screen for to more easily

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
up on the screen for to more easily
track<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.230> number<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> kills<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.090> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
track the number of kills and this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
track the number of kills and this
should<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> last<00:01:03.570> crystal<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.350> need<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
should be the last crystal I need that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.420 
should be the last crystal I need that
is<00:01:05.400> enough<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
is enough time now I'm just going to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
is enough time now I'm just going to
weaken<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.000> zombies<00:01:09.450> shoot<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> couple

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
weaken these zombies shoot them a couple

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850 
weaken these zombies shoot them a couple
times<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> torso<00:01:12.380> now<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> did<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
times in the torso now I did not get a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.289 
times in the torso now I did not get a
prompt<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.240> why<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:17.060> what's<00:01:18.060> cool

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
prompt there to know why and what's cool

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
prompt there to know why and what's cool
about<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:19.080> even<00:01:19.229> need<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.590> get

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
about this is you don't even need to get

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.850 
about this is you don't even need to get
all<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> counters<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> same<00:01:21.540> chain<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
all the counters in the same chain you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
all the counters in the same chain you
just<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:24.210> 15<00:01:24.630> cumulative<00:01:24.900> Lee<00:01:25.259> over

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
just need to get 15 cumulative Lee over

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
just need to get 15 cumulative Lee over
one<00:01:25.799> session<00:01:27.350> there's<00:01:28.350> number<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> will

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
one session there's number one that will

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.670 
one session there's number one that will
not<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:32.009> countable<00:01:32.659> when<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.780> fall<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that a regular is on we can do that can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
that a regular is on we can do that can
be<00:01:40.619> countered<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> lunge<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:43.170> arm

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
be countered are the lunge and the arm

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
be countered are the lunge and the arm
swipe<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.460> easier<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> counter<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> melee

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
swipe it is easier to counter the melee

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
swipe it is easier to counter the melee
the<00:01:45.869> zombies<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.920> fun<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> melee<00:01:47.430> weapon

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the zombies it's fun with a melee weapon

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.889 
the zombies it's fun with a melee weapon
like<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> golf<00:01:48.869> club<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> flaming<00:01:50.070> stick

the<00:03:41.880> good<00:03:42.510> old<00:03:42.660> cops<00:03:43.079> ah

the good old cops ah

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.720 
the good old cops ah
not<00:03:46.380> enough<00:03:46.560> damage<00:03:46.859> done<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.070> him<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.370> kill

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.060 
not enough damage done to him to kill
him<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:48.540> why<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> weaken<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> zombies

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
him so that's why I weaken the zombies

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.910 
him so that's why I weaken the zombies

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
because otherwise a counter kill won't

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.710

there but I'm going to want to kill him
in<00:06:44.389> a<00:06:44.509> combo<00:06:45.199> just<00:06:45.740> to<00:06:45.860> show<00:06:46.069> off<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:47.000> metal<00:06:47.270> at

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
in a combo just to show off the metal at

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.399 
in a combo just to show off the metal at
the<00:06:47.419> end<00:06:49.270> because<00:06:50.270> you<00:06:50.479> actually<00:06:51.050> get<00:06:51.199> a<00:06:51.229> lot

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
the end because you actually get a lot

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.680 
the end because you actually get a lot
of<00:06:51.590> beneficial<00:06:52.430> things<00:06:52.699> from<00:06:53.090> killing<00:06:53.539> the

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
optional boss and I guess that that

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.870 
optional boss and I guess that that

counts as a combo I guess you get a

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.029
