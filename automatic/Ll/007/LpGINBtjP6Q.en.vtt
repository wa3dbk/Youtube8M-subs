Where are you going to run now?

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.850
Hey, why are you afraid?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.460
Your strong, go put up a fight!

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.750
You'll surely win.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.270
Go on. You are bigger than him.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.730
Your right.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.930
You think you can scare me?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.940
I'll stomp your back in!

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.400

Only Gajah can help me now.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.690
Hah, you big loser!

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.540
You can't even handle a rat and you expect to defeat me?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.940
Dream on.
- Wait!

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.540
Kancil, what are you trying to do?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.680
Harimau, Harimau.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.820
Did you know that Gajah meat is very thick and rough?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.740
So?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.870
So?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.370
So let me make him tender for you.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.910
It'll be easier for you to chew!

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.240
What are you saying? I thought you going to help me.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.550
Great. Get on with it.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.120
Ready Gajah?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.950
Hurry up Kancil.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.440
Kancil!

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.700
No! Kancil!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.290
That's it, get him real tender!

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.640
Take that. Let me soften your meat.
- I said stop it!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.140
Kancil! I said stop!

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.850
Or I'll---

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.490
I'll---

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.680
More! More!

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.740
Good riddance! I hope you'll be crushed to death.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.630
Thank you Gajah. You saved my life.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.720
I just wanted to get out. The sky is perfectly fine.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.530
You sneaky liar!

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.700
Good for nothing genius!

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.210
I am a sneaky genius.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.150
Come back here you!

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.410
Farewell my friends. Bye...

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.760
Kancil, Kancil.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.490
If you want something, everything is possible.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.330
Kancil!

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.200
Er, Harimau?

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.430
Can you lift me up?

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.720
Yay, yay. Kancil made it.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.130
Made what? He only made up that 
story! That isn't good right Aki?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.230
Yes, Aris. We shouldn't make up stories.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.250
But Kancil had no choice. He had to save himself.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.460
If not he would have been eaten.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
If I was Rimau, i would have eaten Kancil.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.670
Funny you. It just a cat.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.200
Come now.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.210
Lets go.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.770
I'm so lucky Aki saved me. That well was so scary.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.300
Serves you right! Who asked you to go outside?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.870
Aki! He's bullying me.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.140
Aris. Stop it.
