killed<00:01:55.009> Michael<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> believe<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.759> ending<00:01:57.210> B

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
killed Michael I believe and ending B

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.969 
killed Michael I believe and ending B
would<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:57.840> where<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> killed<00:01:58.439> Travis

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
