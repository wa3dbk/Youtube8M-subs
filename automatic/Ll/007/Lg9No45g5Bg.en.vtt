00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
yeah anyway low gravity cheese on that's

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.010 
yeah anyway low gravity cheese on that's
why<00:00:39.830> I'm<00:00:40.190> able<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> fly<00:00:41.000> with<00:00:41.150> one<00:00:41.239> wing<00:00:41.540> if<00:00:41.750> not
