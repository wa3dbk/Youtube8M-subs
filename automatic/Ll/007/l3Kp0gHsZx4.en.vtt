00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.000
 sometimes 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.340
 the technique that we will apply to 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.620
 then it is called benneteau 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.740
 Metallized products and tools 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.050
 to use are record '-first hd 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.690
 record surface trainer 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.980
 benneteau blanco riquelme 'latics' 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:35.480
 battleship record dye black record top 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 Scraper spatula or metallic trowel roller and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.239
 tow 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 the first thing that must be taken into account 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.860
 It is that the surface is clean 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.790
 free of fatty contaminants or 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.790
 paint in poor condition 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 Once the surface is clean it should be 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.539
 prepare by roller coating a layer 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 of rector first h of this to get 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.280
 an optimal anchor performance and finish 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.030
 of the decorative products required 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.030
 for this technique 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.530
 apply record benneteau white 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.080
 directly and undiluted with trowel 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.720
 metallic 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.390
 You make short stretches and in different 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.200
 achieving addresses completely cover 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.200
 the surface 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.920
 keep in mind leave a layer thickness 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 from 3 to 4 millimeters 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.229
 while the application of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.409
 record benneteau generate the craquelure 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.000
 accelerating the drying process using 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.039
 one or several hot air dryers 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.310
 Once the surface is dry, I will apply with 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.619
 armored metals using tow and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.350
 making circular movements and 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.130
 irregular until covering all of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.130
 the surface 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 in a container mixed in 30% of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.230
 black cutout with 70% water for 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.530
 decrease the intensity and hue of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.530
 colour 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.550
 apply the clipping mixture and 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.069
 using a tow and performing 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.770
 circular and irregular movements 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.680
 to blur and generate effects of 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.400
 depth in the application let dry 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 completely 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.780
 Finally apply cut coat with 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.069
 Roll to seal and give protection 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.010
 additional to the surface decorate 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.080
 two 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 Now that you know the steps of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.310
 application we invite you to embellish 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.430
 your spaces with the record technique 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.280
 metalized benneteau and remember collect 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.840
 your ally in paints and coatings 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.050
 decorative 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.800
 he remembered that ally in painting so 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.849
 heart surface protection its 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.080
 ally s with everything he likes
