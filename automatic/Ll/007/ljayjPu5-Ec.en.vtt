regular<00:02:53.950> 40k<00:02:54.489> game<00:02:55.139> not<00:02:56.139> sure<00:02:56.319> if<00:02:56.410> I'll<00:02:56.530> do

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
regular 40k game not sure if I'll do

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.250 
regular 40k game not sure if I'll do
that<00:02:56.829> maybe<00:02:57.160> I'll<00:02:57.569> peg<00:02:58.569> his<00:02:58.750> feet<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.170> can

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
that maybe I'll peg his feet so I can

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.250 
that maybe I'll peg his feet so I can
swap<00:02:59.920> them<00:03:00.069> though<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.840> likely<00:03:01.840> i'll<00:03:02.079> just

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
swap them though but likely i'll just

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.640 
swap them though but likely i'll just
use<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.530> guy<00:03:02.739> as<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> display<00:03:03.459> feature<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
maybe maybe use them as an objective and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.770 
maybe maybe use them as an objective and
games<00:03:09.609> or<00:03:09.850> something<00:03:09.940> like<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.569> don't
