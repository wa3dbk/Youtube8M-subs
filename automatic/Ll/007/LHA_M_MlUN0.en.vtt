00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello I liked how are you this is another 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.769
 well it's not a gameplay because it's another 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.820
 tutorial so it will say is the week of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.259
 the tutorials because I think so 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.589
 because as you will have given 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:22.619
 account or some do not but I said it in the 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:26.630
 past from in the past video that was 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 of how to download your good skin I said that 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.179
 I had put a map that I made that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.789
 this is a new series that by the way 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.079
 have put to download a new map 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.589
 that I did so you can 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.989
 download and then many will have 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.809
 asked that they could not download what 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 that does not know so in this tutorial they 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.089
 I will teach how to put maps of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 adventures or any special map 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.579
 ok then I will take tea reference 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 to my map where I started downloading 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.860
 okay 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.840
 then the first thing is to go to the map as 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.460
 come here did my channel if they want 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 go for a spin to see the videos 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:17.720
 ok from any map that is going to go 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.210
 link as for example I to mine that for 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.479
 download it to download my map it 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.479
 can go to my channel to more information 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.729
 and here I would come to this network and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.340
 download map ok 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.460
 they would give sirens to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.909
 it is called the link of the map that they are going to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.260
 download then they would download ok 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.190
 that in all I set the example my map 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.850
 so download it 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.500
 ok then 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.890
 and they already download it and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.890
 in all the strange file will come out 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.470
 I'm setting my world as an example 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.410
 ok it pampers me so that I put so that what 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.380
 download then this will come out 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.860
 file is as if this file 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.820
 compressed and then we're going to give it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.820
 double click 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.250
 and then always in these maps of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 adventure or on any map is going to 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.140
 just come one folder only they're going 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.150
 to come a folder if they come with more is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.220
 because maybe it's two maps or it's 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.630
 ok ok 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.630
 so they should always go must come 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.300
 a folder and then we 're going to go to 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.270
 the minecraft folder that those who do not 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.300
 they know how it is to execute we put by 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.610
 percent app data percent and we give the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.280
 intro 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.000
 and it will come out this we open the folder of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.940
 point minecraft we're going to here and we 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.220
 we stay and then the only thing that we have 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.690
 what to do is grab the folder that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.690
 It has the name I'm putting 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.720
 example my world ok the war in the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.170
 folder of you and will happen to 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.580
 saves 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:18.970
 they are going to copy and since everything is done 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.210
 and the only thing they have to see so that 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.440
 see if they were installed correctly 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:31.380
 world they are going to go to minecraft 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.560
 it was going to be all normal ok all like 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 forever 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.050
 okay 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.349
 good this video I do it mainly 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.300
 for the people that maybe 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.060
 they downloaded my world and they can not or 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.530
 with any world ok not those forces 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.530
 with a specific 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.420
 everything to wait for it to load 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.450
 also by the way this I'm going to start 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.230

 they have series videos of mods ok that a 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.840
 the best the next video is the forge 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.919
 he confiscated the forges so he did not know 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.740
