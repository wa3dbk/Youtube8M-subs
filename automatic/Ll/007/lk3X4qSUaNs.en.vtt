00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.779
 we go 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.940
 hello good to all ignorant people 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.430
 I wanted to tell you something important 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.530
 a channel was just over 24 hours ago 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 english took out leaked this supposed face of 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.490
 maxis 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 they said that they had already met and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 was in the files so good 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 Well now another English channel has 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.840
 discovered that that face is false is not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.140
 the face of maximum 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 apparently it is that it belonged rector 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 it was going to be a rector's face but at 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.130
 final was not used was not used 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.460
 then that there are no files stuck 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.930
 but it turns out that it was a supposed face 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.579
 of rite fan but that in the end 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.000
 they used the town 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.310
 I'm very happy about this because honestly 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.090
 when I found out about this english channel 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.439
 this 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.259
 I find it disgusting because this game 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.850
 and any game or any as 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.630
 any movie 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.020
 like you find 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.799
 the things that you know the truth for your 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.520
 own means that you see it not that you 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.170
 they tell it is as if they tell you at the end 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.619
 of the film dies of the protagonist 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.649
 when you have started the new type 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.090
 so I'm glad that in the end this 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.680
 be false 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.860
 it has not been like that 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.230
 I hope these things do not happen again and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.040
 we are us by our own 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.220
 means we find out things without 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.600
 that nobody's chivas 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.600
 until the next video
