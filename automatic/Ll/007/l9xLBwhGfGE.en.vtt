which was the sketch layer we scanned in

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
which was the sketch layer we scanned in
so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.350> turned<00:00:16.619> off<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.010> just

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
show you a few other things really quick
with<00:00:21.390> illustrator<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.369> different<00:00:23.580> things

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
with illustrator to get different things

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
with illustrator to get different things
going<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> need<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.400> the

going for you that you need to work the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
going for you that you need to work the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
best way possible so for example double

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
best way possible so for example double
click<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.460> make<00:00:29.789> sure<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.210> feel

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
click on this and make sure that feel

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
click on this and make sure that feel
new<00:00:30.750> brushes<00:00:30.960> fill<00:00:31.920> new<00:00:32.040> brushstrokes<00:00:32.460> are

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
new brushes fill new brushstrokes are

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.900 
new brushes fill new brushstrokes are
selected<00:00:33.890> then<00:00:34.890> down<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.399> make<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
selected then down here make sure that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
selected then down here make sure that
the<00:00:36.180> background<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> black<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the background one is black and the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
the background one is black and the
foreground<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.430> transparent<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
foreground one is transparent like so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.750 
foreground one is transparent like so
now<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.770> allows<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> draw

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
now what this allows you to do is draw

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
now what this allows you to do is draw
shapes<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.750> fill<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
shapes and then it will fill in that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
shapes and then it will fill in that
shape<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:43.980> say<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> draw<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> shape<00:00:45.120> like

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
shape so let's say you draw a shape like

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.170 
shape so let's say you draw a shape like
that<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.539> fills<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> shape<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.059> an

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that it fills that shape in this is an

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
that it fills that shape in this is an
easy<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.930> come<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> these

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
easy way to come in and do some of these

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.689 
easy way to come in and do some of these
shadows<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> might<00:00:51.329> want<00:00:52.070> like<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
shadows that you might want like so I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
shadows that you might want like so I
can<00:00:53.969> fill<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.570> shape<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.469> doing

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
can fill that shape in and so I'm doing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
can fill that shape in and so I'm doing
this<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> parts<00:00:59.550> where<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> know

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this all the parts where you know

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
this all the parts where you know
thicker<00:01:00.780> hair<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> overlapping<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.609> I'm

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
thicker hair is overlapping you know I'm

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.889 
thicker hair is overlapping you know I'm
just<00:01:02.789> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.090> filling<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> those

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
just kind of filling in some of those

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.420 
just kind of filling in some of those
shapes<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.369> add<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.100> trace

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
shapes in there to add so I could trace

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.219 
shapes in there to add so I could trace
that<00:01:09.150> shape<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.830> didn't<00:01:11.159> trace<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> right

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
that shape and I didn't trace it right

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
that shape and I didn't trace it right
come<00:01:13.229> back<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:15.049> let's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
come back up there like that and let's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
come back up there like that and let's
say<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> wanted<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.740> shadow<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.369> part

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
say I wanted some shadow on this part

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.289 
say I wanted some shadow on this part
here<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:19.159> it's<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.880> quick<00:01:21.150> way<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
here so it's it's a really quick way to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.950 
here so it's it's a really quick way to
add<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:21.960> shape<00:01:22.320> shadows<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 

just<00:01:28.530> trying<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.040> any<00:01:29.190> other

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just trying to see if there's any other

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
just trying to see if there's any other
places<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.530> might<00:01:31.710> benefit<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:34.080> like

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
places where it might benefit it's like

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
places where it might benefit it's like
I<00:01:34.290> wanted<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.400> big<00:01:35.729> part<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> our

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I wanted a lot of this big part of our

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
I wanted a lot of this big part of our
hair<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> shadow<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:38.040> only<00:01:38.159> work

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hair in shadow now this would only work

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.130 
hair in shadow now this would only work
if<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.180> doing<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.540> heavy<00:01:39.750> shadow

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
if I'm going to be doing a heavy shadow

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.160 
if I'm going to be doing a heavy shadow
piece<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.729> example<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.210> could<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.110> know

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
piece but for example you could you know

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.290 
piece but for example you could you know
make<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> big<00:01:43.770> piece<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.640> shadow<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
make a big piece like that in shadow and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.210 
make a big piece like that in shadow and
then<00:01:46.110> start<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.830> oops

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
then start you know oops

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.790 
then start you know oops
coming<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.869> other<00:01:51.869> strands<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.590> hair

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
coming up with other strands of hair

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.350 
coming up with other strands of hair
here<00:01:53.479> like<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.909> start<00:01:56.909> filling<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
here like that and start filling it in

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.790 
here like that and start filling it in
and<00:01:57.420> then<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> dark

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
and then you kind of get this dark

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.859 
and then you kind of get this dark
shadow<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.640> type<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.360> thing<00:02:00.539> going

shadow it you know type of thing going

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.419 
shadow it you know type of thing going
on<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.110> sometimes<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> cool<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> have

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
on and sometimes it's cool to have

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.359 
on and sometimes it's cool to have
really<00:02:05.970> thick<00:02:06.240> shadow<00:02:06.479> pieces<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.050> that

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
really thick shadow pieces like that

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
really thick shadow pieces like that
another<00:02:08.369> thing<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.670> wanted<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:08.940> show<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.570> if

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
another thing I wanted to show you is if

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
another thing I wanted to show you is if
you<00:02:10.050> double<00:02:10.470> click<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:12.180> brush<00:02:12.390> again<00:02:12.750> and

you double click on the brush again and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.420 
you double click on the brush again and
you<00:02:13.050> turn<00:02:13.290> down<00:02:13.320> fidelity<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.130> turn<00:02:14.310> down

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you turn down fidelity and turn down

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.350 
you turn down fidelity and turn down
smoothness<00:02:15.290> click<00:02:16.290> OK<00:02:16.620> I'm<00:02:16.890> gonna<00:02:17.180> bring<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
smoothness click OK I'm gonna bring the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.009 
smoothness click OK I'm gonna bring the
lines<00:02:18.570> back<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> front<00:02:19.700> now<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:21.019> you

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
lines back to the front now when you

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.650 
lines back to the front now when you
like<00:02:22.230> make<00:02:22.560> something<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.540> know

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
like make something like this you know

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.330 
like make something like this you know
it'll<00:02:24.870> stay<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.560> much<00:02:25.680> exactly<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.160> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
it'll stay pretty much exactly as you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.620 
it'll stay pretty much exactly as you
drew<00:02:26.489> right<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.850> doesn't<00:02:27.030> smooth<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.540> out

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
drew right now it doesn't smooth it out

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.020 
drew right now it doesn't smooth it out
as<00:02:27.840> much<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.160> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.610> shaky

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
as much so if you have kind of a shaky

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.790 
as much so if you have kind of a shaky
line<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.630> it'll<00:02:30.930> kind<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> register<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
line like that it'll kind of register it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.930 
line like that it'll kind of register it
a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.650> notice<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.130> uh<00:02:35.250> you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
a little bit but you notice it's uh you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.160 
a little bit but you notice it's uh you
have<00:02:36.060> more<00:02:36.239> control<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
have more control this way so if you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.699 
have more control this way so if you
wanted<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.459> straight<00:02:38.760> lines<00:02:39.709> ok

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
wanted to do you know straight lines ok

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.170 
wanted to do you know straight lines ok
those<00:02:40.920> aren't<00:02:41.310> coming<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.000> good

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.600 

so<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.319> little<00:02:46.439> bit<00:02:46.590> better<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.459> know

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
so it's a little bit better you know

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.940 
so it's a little bit better you know
then<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.659> before<00:02:51.170> trying<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.379> fast

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
then it was before trying to do fast

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.160 
then it was before trying to do fast
lines<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:53.519> um<00:02:53.610> piece<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.879> paper<00:02:54.170> for

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
lines like what um piece of paper for

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.960 
lines like what um piece of paper for
cross<00:02:55.349> hatching<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.489> little<00:02:56.700> bit<00:02:56.790> more

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
cross hatching so it's a little bit more

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.240 
cross hatching so it's a little bit more
control<00:02:57.329> there<00:02:57.599> there's<00:02:57.930> still<00:02:58.049> some<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
control there there's still some you

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
control there there's still some you
know<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.459> not<00:02:59.549> quite<00:02:59.819> what<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.329> want<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.629> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
know it's not quite what you want it to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.699 
know it's not quite what you want it to
be<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> notice<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.430> makes<00:03:02.909> some<00:03:03.209> lines<00:03:03.709> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
be so you notice it makes some lines it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.349 
be so you notice it makes some lines it
does<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.040> changes<00:03:05.489> some<00:03:05.640> lines<00:03:05.849> randomly

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
does like changes some lines randomly

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.030 
does like changes some lines randomly
like<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.720> especially<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> line

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
like that especially if you have a line

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.490 
like that especially if you have a line
here<00:03:08.069> lying<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.939> a<00:03:08.970> line<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.689> you<00:03:10.140> need

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
here lying here a line here and you need

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.099 
here lying here a line here and you need
to<00:03:10.650> work<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:11.040> between<00:03:11.159> those<00:03:11.489> lines<00:03:12.109> it'll

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
to work in between those lines it'll

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.199 
to work in between those lines it'll
often<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:14.010> ruin<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.549> lines<00:03:14.790> as<00:03:15.060> you're

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
often you know ruin the lines as you're

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.420 
often you know ruin the lines as you're
trying<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.569> connect<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.200> that's<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.250> only

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
trying to connect so that's the only

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.699 
trying to connect so that's the only
downfall<00:03:17.639> with<00:03:18.299> Illustrator<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.260> but

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
downfall with Illustrator really but

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.830 
downfall with Illustrator really but
like<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.310> said<00:03:20.370> request<00:03:21.090> action<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.599> can<00:03:21.720> just

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
like I said request action you can just

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.899 
like I said request action you can just
open<00:03:21.959> them<00:03:22.139> another<00:03:22.290> program<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.700> like

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
open them another program you know like

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.520 
open them another program you know like
a<00:03:23.940> painter<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.569> Photoshop<00:03:25.170> or<00:03:25.319> something

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
a painter or Photoshop or something

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.020 
a painter or Photoshop or something
something<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.489> gives<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.730> more<00:03:26.879> control

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
something that gives you more control

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.149 
something that gives you more control
like<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.599> but<00:03:28.109> this<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:28.470> like<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.889> know<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
like that but this was like you know I

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.229 
like that but this was like you know I
guess<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.549> see<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.909> really<00:03:30.090> good

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
guess you can see this is really good

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.420 
guess you can see this is really good
for<00:03:30.420> doing<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:30.780> base<00:03:30.959> work<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.500> notice

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
for doing the base work and notice

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.899 
for doing the base work and notice
there's<00:03:32.639> some<00:03:32.819> parts<00:03:33.180> here<00:03:33.329> when<00:03:33.450> i<00:03:33.510> zoom<00:03:33.720> in

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
there's some parts here when i zoom in

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.129 
there's some parts here when i zoom in
where<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.060> lines<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.510> sloppy<00:03:36.750> where

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
where the lines look sloppy where

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.259 
where the lines look sloppy where
they're<00:03:37.319> overlapping<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.099> stuff<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.909> here

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
they're overlapping and stuff like here

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.660 
they're overlapping and stuff like here
and<00:03:39.389> here<00:03:39.689> and<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.859> can<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.400> either

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and here and so I can you know either

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.629 
and here and so I can you know either
take<00:03:41.939> my<00:03:42.060> time<00:03:42.299> or<00:03:42.540> when<00:03:42.689> I'm<00:03:42.780> inking<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:44.040> avoid

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
take my time or when I'm inking to avoid

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.080 
take my time or when I'm inking to avoid
some<00:03:44.939> of<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.209> or<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.900> lot<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.939> then<00:03:48.060> I

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
some of that or a lot of it and then I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.759 
some of that or a lot of it and then I
can<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:48.659> open<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.199> see<00:03:49.379> right<00:03:49.530> there

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
can then open that see right there

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.770 
can then open that see right there
that's<00:03:50.310> hard<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.790> avoid<00:03:50.970> sometimes<00:03:51.419> but<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.660> can

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
that's hard to avoid sometimes but I can

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.559 
that's hard to avoid sometimes but I can
always<00:03:51.900> open<00:03:52.319> this<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.680> Photoshop<00:03:53.489> again<00:03:54.150> you

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
always open this in Photoshop again you

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.030 
always open this in Photoshop again you
know<00:03:54.660> save<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.079> an<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.379> open<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.889> eye<00:03:55.919> in

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
know save it as an a I open the eye in

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.619 
know save it as an a I open the eye in
Photoshop<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.669> I<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.879> erase<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.389> things

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
Photoshop and I can erase little things

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.809 
Photoshop and I can erase little things
like<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.870> where<00:03:58.260> little<00:03:58.530> lines<00:03:59.310> overlapping

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
like that where little lines overlapping

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.550 
like that where little lines overlapping
I<00:04:00.060> don't<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.389> it<00:04:00.629> I<00:04:00.810> can<00:04:01.169> go<00:04:01.319> in<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:01.530> just

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
I don't like it I can go in and just

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.860 
I don't like it I can go in and just
clean<00:04:01.889> up<00:04:01.919> these<00:04:02.549> little<00:04:02.730> parts<00:04:03.209> really

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
clean up these little parts really

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.430 
clean up these little parts really
quickly<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:05.099> no<00:04:05.220> big<00:04:05.400> deal<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:06.440> just

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
quickly and it's no big deal so I just

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.770 
quickly and it's no big deal so I just
like<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.709> way<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.310> lines<00:04:08.549> end<00:04:08.790> up<00:04:08.909> looking<00:04:09.269> in

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
like the way the lines end up looking in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.349 
like the way the lines end up looking in
Illustrator<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.650> that's<00:04:10.769> why<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:10.980> use<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.220> but<00:04:12.060> I

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
Illustrator so that's why I use it but I

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.059 
Illustrator so that's why I use it but I
have<00:04:12.659> been<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.079> know<00:04:13.199> experimenting<00:04:13.949> with

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
have been you know experimenting with

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.349 
have been you know experimenting with
painter<00:04:14.400> because<00:04:14.489> painter<00:04:14.909> can<00:04:15.090> get<00:04:15.209> some

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
painter because painter can get some

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.149 
painter because painter can get some
pretty<00:04:15.540> cool<00:04:15.750> line<00:04:15.989> work<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.709> does<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.130> be

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
pretty cool line work it does have to be

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.670 
pretty cool line work it does have to be
more<00:04:17.400> careful<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:18.449> inking<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.109> nothing

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
more careful with inking and nothing

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.279 
more careful with inking and nothing
really<00:04:19.769> beats<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.099> paintbrush<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.079> if

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
really beats a paintbrush so if you if

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.420 
really beats a paintbrush so if you if
you<00:04:22.440> really<00:04:22.590> want<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> ink<00:04:23.010> ink<00:04:23.250> with

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
you really want to ink ink with

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430 
you really want to ink ink with
paintbrush<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.030> typically<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.449> don't<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:24.900> much

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
paintbrush but typically I don't do much

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.070 
paintbrush but typically I don't do much
you<00:04:25.830> know<00:04:25.919> much<00:04:26.130> inking<00:04:26.550> anyway<00:04:26.849> because<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.419> do

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
you know much inking anyway because I do

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.070 
you know much inking anyway because I do
very<00:04:28.349> light<00:04:28.590> inking<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:30.419> illustrated

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
very light inking that is illustrated

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.510 
very light inking that is illustrated
works<00:04:31.500> for<00:04:31.650> me<00:04:31.740> because<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.979> don't<00:04:32.159> get<00:04:32.340> really

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
works for me because I don't get really

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.610 
works for me because I don't get really
heavy<00:04:32.760> with<00:04:32.940> my<00:04:33.060> inks<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.570> do<00:04:33.960> most<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.560> work

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
heavy with my inks I do most of the work

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.890 
heavy with my inks I do most of the work
in<00:04:34.949> coloring<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.940> just<00:04:36.090> do<00:04:36.240> kind<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.570> basic

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
in coloring so I just do kind of basic

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.110 
in coloring so I just do kind of basic
outlines<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.650> do<00:04:37.860> do<00:04:38.099> the<00:04:38.250> variations<00:04:38.880> and

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
outlines I do do the variations and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.719 
outlines I do do the variations and
thickness<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:39.599> stuff<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.080> anyway<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:41.490> we

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
thickness and stuff but anyway so as we

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.200 
thickness and stuff but anyway so as we
can<00:04:41.820> see<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.380> an<00:04:43.380> overview<00:04:43.830> quickly<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
can see then an overview quickly of the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.240 
can see then an overview quickly of the
style<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.690> we<00:04:45.870> covered<00:04:46.320> for<00:04:46.349> the<00:04:46.620> hair<00:04:46.889> is

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
style that we covered for the hair is

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.909 
style that we covered for the hair is
you<00:04:47.729> start<00:04:48.000> with<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> major<00:04:48.510> clumps<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.800> know

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
you start with the major clumps you know

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.560 
you start with the major clumps you know
the<00:04:50.039> major<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.760> let's<00:04:51.000> shape<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.360> hair

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
the major so let's shape of the hair

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.930 
the major so let's shape of the hair
then<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.169> start<00:04:52.530> working<00:04:53.370> with<00:04:53.400> clumps<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
then you start working with clumps and

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.820 
then you start working with clumps and
layers<00:04:54.120> one<00:04:54.539> this<00:04:54.870> one's<00:04:55.139> over<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.560> one

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
layers one this one's over that one

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.310 
layers one this one's over that one
that<00:04:56.490> clump<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.240> underneath<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
that clump is underneath that one the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.400 
that clump is underneath that one the
background<00:04:58.860> clump<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.720> then<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.900> work<00:05:01.200> on

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
background clump and then you work on

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.590 
background clump and then you work on
filling<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.520> white<00:05:02.700> spaces<00:05:03.210> within<00:05:03.390> those

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
filling in the white spaces within those

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600 
filling in the white spaces within those
clumps<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.200> we<00:05:04.290> we<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.950> know<00:05:04.980> we<00:05:05.220> talked

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
clumps and we we just you know we talked

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.890 
clumps and we we just you know we talked
about<00:05:05.730> different<00:05:05.940> techniques<00:05:06.420> how<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.720> do

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
about different techniques how to do

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.580 
about different techniques how to do
that<00:05:07.080> how<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.860> have<00:05:08.100> lines<00:05:09.350> different<00:05:10.350> kinds

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
that how to have lines different kinds

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.200 
that how to have lines different kinds
of<00:05:10.650> lines<00:05:10.890> you<00:05:11.100> can<00:05:11.220> have<00:05:11.370> overlapping<00:05:11.940> each

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
of lines you can have overlapping each

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.380 
of lines you can have overlapping each
other<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.470> one<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.800> ways<00:05:13.980> was<00:05:14.390> they

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
other and so one of the ways was they

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.450 
other and so one of the ways was they
find<00:05:15.720> one<00:05:15.960> well<00:05:16.560> it's<00:05:16.650> all<00:05:16.800> just<00:05:16.920> draw<00:05:17.130> clump

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
find one well it's all just draw clump

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.490 
find one well it's all just draw clump
here<00:05:17.610> really<00:05:17.760> quick<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.810> have<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.110> clump

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
here really quick so you have this clump

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.170 
here really quick so you have this clump
and<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:20.100> big<00:05:20.340> white<00:05:20.550> space<00:05:20.850> whatever

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
and you know big white space whatever

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.360 
and you know big white space whatever
you<00:05:21.270> want<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.540> break<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.050> up<00:05:22.170> so<00:05:22.200> you<00:05:23.040> can<00:05:23.160> have

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
you want to break it up so you can have

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.640 
you want to break it up so you can have
for<00:05:23.790> example<00:05:23.850> lines<00:05:24.480> coming<00:05:24.930> like<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.380> and

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
for example lines coming like this and

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.760 
for example lines coming like this and
then<00:05:26.220> meeting<00:05:26.400> up<00:05:26.640> together<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.620> can

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
then meeting up together and so you can

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.800 
then meeting up together and so you can
have<00:05:28.950> you<00:05:29.760> know<00:05:29.850> lines<00:05:30.120> like<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.390> inside<00:05:30.780> of

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
have you know lines like that inside of

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.380 
have you know lines like that inside of
it<00:05:30.990> then<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.320> have<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.800> wild<00:05:32.490> hair<00:05:32.880> you

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
it then you can have a wild hair you

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.120 
it then you can have a wild hair you
know<00:05:33.510> coming<00:05:33.780> out<00:05:33.960> like<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.800> you<00:05:34.860> would

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
know coming out like that and you would

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.550 
know coming out like that and you would
erase<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.790> there<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.360> if<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:36.960> decide<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.410> do

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
erase in there and if you decide to do

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.470 
erase in there and if you decide to do
that<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:37.830> Illustrator<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:39.120> you<00:05:39.210> can<00:05:39.330> just

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
that in Illustrator then you can just

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.000 
that in Illustrator then you can just
remember<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.320> did<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.770> in

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
remember that you did that in

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.830 
remember that you did that in
Illustrator<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:41.820> then<00:05:42.060> go<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.360> erase<00:05:42.570> those

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
Illustrator and then go and erase those

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.340 
Illustrator and then go and erase those
lines

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
lines

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.020 
lines
you<00:05:43.560> know<00:05:43.680> back<00:05:43.950> when<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.280> import<00:05:44.790> it<00:05:44.940> back

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
you know back when you import it back

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.910 
you know back when you import it back
into<00:05:45.210> Photoshop<00:05:45.420> or<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.410> can<00:05:46.530> take<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.770> time

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
into Photoshop or you can take the time

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.560 
into Photoshop or you can take the time
do<00:05:47.070> an<00:05:47.160> illustrator<00:05:47.520> using<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.000> cut<00:05:48.210> tool<00:05:48.420> but

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
do an illustrator using the cut tool but

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.720 
do an illustrator using the cut tool but
it's<00:05:48.690> really<00:05:48.810> time<00:05:49.140> consuming<00:05:49.170> and<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.040> it's

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
it's really time consuming and and it's

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.600 
it's really time consuming and and it's
lame<00:05:50.990> it's<00:05:51.990> hard<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.320> do<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.680> just<00:05:53.040> takes<00:05:53.460> way

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
lame it's hard to do it just takes way

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.650 
lame it's hard to do it just takes way
too<00:05:53.640> much<00:05:53.790> time<00:05:54.260> right<00:05:55.260> so<00:05:56.150> once<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.270> fill<00:05:57.480> in

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
too much time right so once you fill in

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.540 
too much time right so once you fill in
you<00:05:57.870> start<00:05:58.350> filling<00:05:58.530> those<00:05:58.740> areas<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.460> then

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
you start filling those areas and then

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.970 
you start filling those areas and then
you<00:05:59.640> overlap<00:06:00.510> hairs<00:06:00.870> like<00:06:01.470> we<00:06:01.620> did<00:06:01.770> over<00:06:01.800> here

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
you overlap hairs like we did over here

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.890 
you overlap hairs like we did over here
and<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.400> raise<00:06:02.580> some<00:06:02.880> areas<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.510> not<00:06:03.570> some

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
and you raise some areas and not some

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.840 
and you raise some areas and not some
areas<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.380> get<00:06:04.530> that<00:06:05.100> kind<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.430> look<00:06:05.640> and

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
areas to get that kind of look and

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.030 
areas to get that kind of look and
typically<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.450> just<00:06:06.720> do<00:06:06.900> that<00:06:07.050> at<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.320> end<00:06:07.350> at

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
typically you just do that at the end at

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.460 
typically you just do that at the end at
the<00:06:08.340> tops<00:06:08.700> over<00:06:09.030> here<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.510> kind<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.290> can

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
the tops over here you kind of you can

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.780 
the tops over here you kind of you can
leave<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.830> lines<00:06:11.070> overlapping<00:06:11.490> like<00:06:11.760> I

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
leave the lines overlapping like I

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.270 
leave the lines overlapping like I
should<00:06:12.030> probably<00:06:12.590> leave<00:06:13.590> like<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:13.890> line

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
should probably leave like that line

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.000 
should probably leave like that line
overlapping<00:06:14.790> for<00:06:15.450> example<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.740> maybe<00:06:16.860> even

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
overlapping for example and maybe even

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.330 
overlapping for example and maybe even
that<00:06:17.280> one<00:06:17.490> and<00:06:17.760> then<00:06:18.600> I'd<00:06:19.470> have<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.800> go<00:06:19.920> back<00:06:19.950> in

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
that one and then I'd have to go back in

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.430 
that one and then I'd have to go back in
and<00:06:20.490> make<00:06:20.640> all<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:21.030> nice<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:21.480> smooth<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.110> just

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
and make all that nice and smooth I just

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440 
and make all that nice and smooth I just
don't<00:06:22.590> feel<00:06:22.680> like<00:06:22.740> doing<00:06:22.830> it<00:06:23.070> right<00:06:23.160> now

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
don't feel like doing it right now

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.330 
don't feel like doing it right now
anyway<00:06:24.450> so<00:06:24.590> that<00:06:25.590> looks<00:06:25.740> all<00:06:25.890> ugly<00:06:26.190> because

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
anyway so that looks all ugly because

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.390 
anyway so that looks all ugly because
I'm<00:06:26.520> not<00:06:26.670> zoomed<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.240> and<00:06:27.390> stuff<00:06:27.660> and<00:06:27.900> I'm<00:06:27.960> not

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
I'm not zoomed in and stuff and I'm not

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.920 
I'm not zoomed in and stuff and I'm not
you<00:06:29.400> know<00:06:29.520> trying<00:06:29.790> to<00:06:29.820> make<00:06:29.910> it<00:06:30.120> all<00:06:30.240> perfect

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
you know trying to make it all perfect

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.780 
you know trying to make it all perfect
and<00:06:31.290> smooth<00:06:31.650> but<00:06:32.010> anyway<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.790> get<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.030> idea

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.820 

and<00:06:37.790> then<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.840> know<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.020> end<00:06:39.110> result<00:06:39.260> is<00:06:39.620> you

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
and then you know the end result is you

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.900 
and then you know the end result is you
end<00:06:39.980> up<00:06:40.070> with<00:06:40.250> something<00:06:40.460> like<00:06:40.700> there's

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
end up with something like there's

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.490 
end up with something like there's
something<00:06:41.270> you<00:06:41.420> know<00:06:41.540> that<00:06:42.080> looks<00:06:42.260> really

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
something you know that looks really

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.810 
something you know that looks really
complicated<00:06:42.830> to<00:06:43.100> do<00:06:43.280> but<00:06:43.400> it's<00:06:43.520> really<00:06:43.580> not

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
complicated to do but it's really not

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820 
complicated to do but it's really not
it's<00:06:44.060> kind<00:06:44.300> of<00:06:44.389> time-consuming<00:06:44.660> but<00:06:45.200> it's

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
it's kind of time-consuming but it's

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.800 
it's kind of time-consuming but it's
really<00:06:46.010> not<00:06:46.160> too<00:06:46.370> complicated<00:06:46.760> and<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:47.600> looks

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
really not too complicated and it looks

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.970 
really not too complicated and it looks
pretty<00:06:47.990> cool<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:48.230> end<00:06:48.320> result<00:06:48.590> is<00:06:48.770> kind<00:06:48.950> of

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
pretty cool the end result is kind of

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.070 
pretty cool the end result is kind of
nice<00:06:49.100> looking<00:06:49.310> so<00:06:50.270> that's<00:06:50.540> how<00:06:50.690> you<00:06:50.750> get<00:06:50.900> that

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
nice looking so that's how you get that

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.260 
nice looking so that's how you get that
Marvel<00:06:51.500> style<00:06:51.770> here<00:06:52.130> and<00:06:52.400> then<00:06:52.550> we'll<00:06:52.760> in<00:06:52.970> the
