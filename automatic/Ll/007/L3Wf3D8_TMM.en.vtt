00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.750
 in today's Catholic response we would like 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.560
 to answer the question of how to combat 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.529
 good spiritual laziness 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.699
 like any disease so that we can 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.220
 fight the 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.620
 we need to know its causes 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.649
 then the catechism of the Catholic Church in 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.610
 help in describing the number 2733 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.420
 spiritual laziness is ascetic and with 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.350
 that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.840
 lighting the way out of this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.680
 dark alley of spiritual life 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.960
 come on then what happened tell us 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.140
 another temptation whose door is opened to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.260
 by presumption it is not the ascidian called 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.479
 also laziness 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.259
 spiritual priests understand this 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.140
 word as a form of depression of 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.670
 life to the relaxation of the acese 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.600
 reduced vigilance and neglect 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.889
 from heart 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 then look there in the description already 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:29.090
 the exit path is set, it says 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.729
 so it 's a depression depression 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.719
 person's spirituality she is discouraged 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 to pray 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.859
 see this part of the catechism here is 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.859
 speaking of the life of prayer 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.609
 so in the prayer life I have two 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:54.829
 recesses 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.829
 and these two recesses are the presumption of 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.189
 than to think that I am already holy that I 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.520
 I have already reached a level of communion with 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:10.429
 Extraordinary god and discouragement 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.190
 the dismay where I'm actually in a 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.170
 such spiritual laziness where I 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 dragged across the floor 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.319
 see that there is an abyss that invokes another 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.770
 abyss 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.440
 the catechism tells us that the presumption does not 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.540
 opens the door to laziness or in the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.600
 fund in the background there is presumption is the mother of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.860
 laziness presentation she 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.070
 has this daughter 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.460
 spiritual laziness is born by the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.330
 presumption because the people who find themselves 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.860
 well think they do not need any more 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:53.420
 watch jesus say watch and pray that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.450
 surveillance is necessary to compare 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.850
 is behind the surveillance is the idea of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 that we are 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.110
 At night this world this life is 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.270
 a nocturnal vigil in which the world or 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.310
 whoever does not have faith on Sunday they 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.010
 They are so traveling traveling in their 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.560
 dreams in illusions on false promises 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.360
 who is in sin is actually in a 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.730
 unreal world 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.480
 we who have faith have spiked feet 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.450
 on the ground but to keep our feet 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.720
 on the ground we need to fight for 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.670
 stay awake 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.800
 imagine a person there by 3 am the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.900
 Every moment she needs to do something is 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.000
 I need water on my face if I pinch 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.160
 is to make the movement work out because 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.630
 otherwise she knows that if she seats five 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.810
 minutes she will fatally nap 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.210
 some people think that faith takes the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.400
 our feet off the ground because he comes to 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.920
 need the effort to keep the faith 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.110
 since I have to at all times 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.360
 strive to keep the faith then it seems 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.130
 that faith is a somewhat false thing, ie 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.110
 I have to convince myself I started 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.290
 I started because if I do not stop 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.270
 pedaling I fall into the reality of 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.140
 unbelief or faith 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.060
 It would be an effort and because it is an effort 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.320
 she takes my feet off the ground exactly 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.230
 the opposite 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.580
 this comparison of surveillance and shows 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:26.990
 that faith requires effort because the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.300
 tendency is to get out of the real get out of 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.700
 entering the false promises of 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.240
 happiness that are contained in each 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.640
 temptation in every sin because well the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.780
 catechism tells us a decrease in 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.690
 surveillance 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.249
 the person thinks he already has faith and does not 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.919
 need more effort 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.469
 began the spiritual life by striving 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.489
 but it arrives there by the many says no more 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:52.009
 now i already know 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:54.409
 now I'm converted I 've already become 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.839
 I have become a Catholic. 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.889
 professional saint I am a saint of 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.769
 little wallet 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.249
 I do not need to strain my brother any more 

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:06.889
 for this nonsense is a struggle for life 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.239
 of man on earth 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:15.799
 so let's make the proper comparison 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:19.569
 if you are a runner an athlete you 

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:22.429
 runs simply 100 meters 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.999
 It is evident that you can have a 

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:28.099
 huge that will only run 100 meters but 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:29.689
 if you are a marathon runner your 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.269
 rhythm the other because you know that the 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.069
 business will be well accomplished so the 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:35.779
 Our life, our life, the marathon has 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.979
 people who think that the spiritual life is 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.839
 100 meters flat 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.729
 so he thinks that if he idea that 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.259
 initial effort and will be able to 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.299
 Ok it's good 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:48.619
 I made an effort now going forward to 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:50.839
 inertia to inertia in loss of 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:53.089
 spiritual altitude 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.249
 if you took off you made a huge effort 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.839
 the plane was flying by and there 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.649
 so many and turns off my engines 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.539
 little brother 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.829
 on the day you rub face on the floor at 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:06.559
 It's not my fault, it 's you who gave up. 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:08.569
 then constant vigilance a 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.059
 relaxation 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:15.469
 the reduction of surveillance an 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:18.439
 Relaxation serves then I needed 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.729
 surveillance but there is also a need to 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.369
 to go 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.869
 we will never get to a point in the 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.610
 spirituality that does not have to be 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:27.349
 a certain 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.399
 it is true that the great masters 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.409
 spirituality 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.769
 it's not like santa teresa d'avila is joÃ£o 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.709
 of the Cross speak of the various phases of life 

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:39.199
 that the purgative phase exists 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:42.199
 characterized mainly by the sesi 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.899
 then neven the active illuminated phase 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.669
 doing unit v is lethal so i go 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:49.849
 spiritually prohibit this we create 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.829
 Some people who make it happen 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.169
 to disappear is not only a question of 

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:57.620
 Emphasis on session should last 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:00.919
 whole should last a lifetime 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.389
 and so also the neglect of the heart 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:09.439
 you need to take care of your heart you 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:13.099
 caring for your soul is what you have 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:14.930
 more precious then so many people 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.520
 taking care of one's body taking care of 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.560
 health by doing that which is not 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:24.319
 taking care of the soul as well laziness and 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.150
 should be fought with 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:32.150
 to asceticism and the 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.960
 heart that is exercised mainly in the 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.509
 prayer do not listen to god let god 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.409
 speak my soul and put my finger on the 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.810
 wound 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:44.479
 even if it is not pleasant to hear 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:48.919
 what god means if we do 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:51.400
 we will not be hiding the 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:56.419
 our talents and we will be fighting 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:59.379
 this enormous evil that is so 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.379
 spiritual laziness
