00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.520
 Let's make a cake! 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.300
 This has been baking for a long time 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.920
 So, I have 500g sugar in the bowl 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.380
 I'll add 4 tablespoons of plain flour 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.340
 Then half a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.620
 Mix the flour and salt into it 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 Next 4 eggs 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 And 250ml buttermilk 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 Jooo 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.920
 uh .. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.800
 Maybe you ask me why I'm not using normal milk? 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.680
 no .. 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 Then it couldn't be a buttermilk cake. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.280
 2 more teaspoons of vanilla extract 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.160
 And 120g butter 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 which is dissolved 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
 Mix it all together. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 That'll take us a minute 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 We'll leave it aside 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.040
 Here's the crust 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.780
 I didn't do crust, I just bought it 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.220
 We'll put the stuff in it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.260
 Jooo 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 I'd put lemon there 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.020
 I could buy lemon and add bark, but I don't have any 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.680
 Dust the surface with a little nutmeg 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680
 just a little bit 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 Put it in an oven preheated to 180 Â° C for about 55 to 60 minutes to bake 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.780
 This is how it looks after 55 minutes 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.140
 See how it shakes 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 That's the way it's supposed to be 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180
 Let it cool for 2 hours 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.400
 Let's try a piece of this cake 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 I finally let it cool for 3 hours 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 She looks amazing 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380
 I think it will taste like that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.240
 mmmmhh 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 You vado, that's so creamy! 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 Softly spiced and sweet ... 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.660
 ... and CREAM !!! 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 You have to try 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080
 Thanks a lot for watching !!! 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.840
