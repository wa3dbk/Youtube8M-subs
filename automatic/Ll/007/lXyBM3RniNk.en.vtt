out but of course if you choose your
moment<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> choose<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> moment<00:00:13.830> when

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
moment you choose the moment when

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
moment you choose the moment when
they're<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.280> practicing<00:00:15.150> their<00:00:15.570> starts<00:00:16.139> and

they're all practicing their starts and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.570 
they're all practicing their starts and
there's<00:00:16.500> nothing<00:00:16.800> better<00:00:16.949> than<00:00:17.039> standing<00:00:17.490> by

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
there's nothing better than standing by

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880 
there's nothing better than standing by
a<00:00:17.609> Formula<00:00:18.000> One<00:00:18.029> car<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:19.230> making<00:00:19.439> its

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
getaway so I stood there for about an

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
getaway so I stood there for about an
hour<00:00:22.949> while<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> cars<00:00:23.850> pull<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.539> up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
in front of me and they went through

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
in front of me and they went through
their<00:00:25.949> start<00:00:26.250> routine<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.439> amazing

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
their start routine and it was amazing

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
their start routine and it was amazing
actually<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.279> were<00:00:29.340> stationary<00:00:29.849> they're

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually as they were stationary they're

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.759 
actually as they were stationary they're
obviously<00:00:30.449> listening<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.080> instructions<00:00:31.230> from

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
obviously listening to instructions from

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.260 
obviously listening to instructions from
engineers<00:00:32.160> pressing<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.640> button<00:00:32.700> pressing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
engineers pressing this button pressing

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
engineers pressing this button pressing
that<00:00:33.360> Badham<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.780> much<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.410> car<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:34.800> jolting

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that Badham how much the car was jolting

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
that Badham how much the car was jolting
each<00:00:35.460> time<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.030> found<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> different<00:00:37.170> clutch

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
each time they found a different clutch

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.880 
each time they found a different clutch
release<00:00:37.920> point<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.030> selected<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.600> gear

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
release point or they selected a gear

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.229 
release point or they selected a gear
and<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.129> move<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> car<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.090> one

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and just move the car around at one

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
and just move the car around at one
stage<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.050> said<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> Mercedes<00:00:44.040> drivers

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
stage I said one of the Mercedes drivers

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
stage I said one of the Mercedes drivers
practice<00:00:44.850> starting<00:00:45.629> second<00:00:45.989> gear<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
practice starting second gear and you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.380 
practice starting second gear and you
could<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.550> into<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> cockpits<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
could look right into the cockpits and I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.760 
could look right into the cockpits and I
thought<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> took

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
thought I'd just do this because I took

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.319 
thought I'd just do this because I took
a<00:00:49.829> few<00:00:50.010> photographs<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.820> show<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> bring

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a few photographs just to show and bring

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
a few photographs just to show and bring
us<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> date<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> cars<00:00:52.739> not

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
us up to date with some of the cars not

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.069 
us up to date with some of the cars not
all<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.149> with

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
all because not all were there with

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
all because not all were there with
their<00:00:55.469> steering<00:00:56.280> wheel<00:00:56.430> layouts<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.120> because

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
their steering wheel layouts now because

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.549 
their steering wheel layouts now because
quite<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> differences<00:00:58.320> have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
quite a lot of differences have

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.760 
quite a lot of differences have
materialized<00:00:59.550> between<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.960> teams<00:01:01.260> partly

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
materialized between the teams partly

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.509 
materialized between the teams partly
because<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> new<00:01:02.719> McLaren<00:01:03.719> electronics

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
because of the new McLaren electronics

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
because of the new McLaren electronics
display<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.909> showed<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.810> separate

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
display that we showed in a separate

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.450 
display that we showed in a separate
video<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> start<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> year<00:01:08.130> partly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
video at the start of the year partly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
video at the start of the year partly
because<00:01:08.610> there's<00:01:09.600> still<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> different

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
because there's still a lot of different

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
because there's still a lot of different
preferences<00:01:11.220> from<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.549> engineer<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.479> another

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
preferences from one engineer to another

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
preferences from one engineer to another
so<00:01:12.930> here's<00:01:13.200> Williams<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> Valtteri

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so here's Williams this is Valtteri

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.469 
so here's Williams this is Valtteri
Bottas

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
Bottas

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
Bottas
cockpit<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.619> say<00:01:16.740> Williams<00:01:17.070> don't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
cockpit as you can say Williams don't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.420 
cockpit as you can say Williams don't
have<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> display<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.600> steering<00:01:18.869> wheel<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
have a display on the steering wheel and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.020 
have a display on the steering wheel and
there's<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> dash<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
there's is on the dash and that is a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.359 
there's is on the dash and that is a
system<00:01:24.299> adopted<00:01:24.990> also<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.650> Red<00:01:25.890> Bull<00:01:25.920> but

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
system adopted also by Red Bull but

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.280 
system adopted also by Red Bull but
slightly<00:01:27.119> different<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> case<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.140> Red

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
slightly different in the case of Red

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
slightly different in the case of Red
Bull<00:01:28.320> everything's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.250> lower<00:01:29.579> as

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
Bull everything's a little bit lower as

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.609 
Bull everything's a little bit lower as
well<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> Williams<00:01:30.990> looks

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
well but that's what the Williams looks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.850 
well but that's what the Williams looks
like<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.310> Bal<00:01:33.210> Tory's<00:01:33.540> position<00:01:33.990> next<00:01:34.619> car

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
like from Bal Tory's position next car

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.149 
like from Bal Tory's position next car
is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.700> Sauber<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.229> Stefan<00:01:37.650> Gutierrez

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
is the Sauber this is a Stefan Gutierrez

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
is the Sauber this is a Stefan Gutierrez
that's<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> big<00:01:38.670> sponsor<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> side<00:01:40.020> let's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that's a big sponsor on the side let's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780 
that's a big sponsor on the side let's
hope<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.500> brings<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.890> lots<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> money<00:01:41.549> for

sabah<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.479> that's<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.810> they

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
sabah because i think that's what they

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
sabah because i think that's what they
need<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.229> than<00:01:43.380> anything<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.310> but

looks<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.560> neat<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.600> impressive<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
looks pretty neat and impressive one of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
looks pretty neat and impressive one of
the<00:01:55.200> things<00:01:55.439> you've<00:01:56.310> probably<00:01:56.520> heard<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the things you've probably heard this a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
the things you've probably heard this a
million<00:01:57.090> times<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.659> worth<00:01:57.750> saying<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
million times but it's worth saying is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
million times but it's worth saying is
that<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> walk<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.490> pit<00:01:59.700> lane<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that when you walk up a pit lane and you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.389 
that when you walk up a pit lane and you
look<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> team<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.990> salba<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.219> not

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
look at a team like salba which are not

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.569 
look at a team like salba which are not
doing<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.500> look<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
doing well and you look at the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.490 
doing well and you look at the
preparation<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.360> look<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> detail<00:02:07.290> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
preparation you look at the detail of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.779 
preparation you look at the detail of
the<00:02:07.590> car<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.099> look<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.429> everything<00:02:08.670> that's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the car you look at everything that's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.900 
the car you look at everything that's
going<00:02:09.090> into<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.619> absolutely

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
going into it and they look absolutely

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.140 
going into it and they look absolutely
superb

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
superb

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
superb
it's<00:02:12.300> difficult<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.080> imagine

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's difficult to imagine

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.690 
it's difficult to imagine
but<00:02:14.730> how<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> team<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.220> far<00:02:17.520> off<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
but how a team can be so far off the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.530 
but how a team can be so far off the
relative<00:02:18.330> pace<00:02:19.190> given<00:02:20.190> still<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.210> level<00:02:21.480> at

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
relative pace given still the level at

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.480 
relative pace given still the level at
which<00:02:21.570> they<00:02:21.870> operate<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.040> guess

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
which they operate but that's I guess

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.640 
which they operate but that's I guess
that's<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> true<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.270> it's<00:02:24.630> standard<00:02:25.560> in

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that's the true this it's standard in

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.960 
that's the true this it's standard in
motor<00:02:25.860> racing<00:02:25.950> throughout<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> world<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
motor racing throughout the world you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.010 
motor racing throughout the world you
can<00:02:27.090> look<00:02:27.210> at<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> guy<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> back<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
can look at the guy in the back of the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
can look at the guy in the back of the
grid<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.350> still<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.070> cars<00:02:29.340> pretty<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
grid and still the cars pretty good and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.960 
grid and still the cars pretty good and
pretty<00:02:30.270> well<00:02:30.450> done<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.010> anyway<00:02:32.010> Sabha<00:02:32.700> there

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
pretty well done but anyway Sabha there

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.660 
pretty well done but anyway Sabha there
we<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.240> with<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.540> large<00:02:33.840> screen<00:02:34.740> Mercedes

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
we go with that large screen Mercedes

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.810 
we go with that large screen Mercedes
also<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.490> slightly<00:02:38.490> different

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
also have that slightly different

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.180 
also have that slightly different
positioning<00:02:39.390> again<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.860> steering<00:02:41.100> wheel

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
positioning again of the steering wheel

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.700 
positioning again of the steering wheel
you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.640> how<00:02:41.850> relatively<00:02:42.840> near<00:02:43.110> Luis

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
you can see how relatively near Luis

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.400 
you can see how relatively near Luis
sits<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.790> wheel<00:02:45.090> where<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.630> well<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.260> they

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
sits to the wheel where as well but they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.800 
sits to the wheel where as well but they
have<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.830> large<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:48.060> looks<00:02:48.090> as<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:48.660> have

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
have that large it looks as if they have

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.110 
have that large it looks as if they have
that<00:02:48.960> large<00:02:49.200> McLaren<00:02:50.160> electronics<00:02:50.220> display

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that large McLaren electronics display

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.380 
that large McLaren electronics display
and<00:02:52.220> then<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> Red<00:02:53.880> Bull<00:02:54.090> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and then here we go to the Red Bull and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.200 
and then here we go to the Red Bull and
a<00:02:55.140> completely<00:02:55.530> different<00:02:55.860> feel<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.700> look<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
a completely different feel and look I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.670 
a completely different feel and look I
love<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.630> actually<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.020> think<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.470> if

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
love that actually I think that's one if

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.530 
love that actually I think that's one if
you<00:02:58.770> had<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.010> say<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> characteristic

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you had to say what is a characteristic

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.720 
you had to say what is a characteristic
of<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.690> Adrian<00:03:01.140> Newey<00:03:01.380> Red<00:03:02.130> Bull<00:03:02.340> design<00:03:02.700> I

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
of the Adrian Newey Red Bull design I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
of the Adrian Newey Red Bull design I
would<00:03:02.970> say<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.450> steering<00:03:04.140> wheel<00:03:04.260> shape<00:03:04.740> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
would say that steering wheel shape and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.070 
would say that steering wheel shape and
the<00:03:05.190> cockpit<00:03:05.490> scuttle<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.360> at<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> top<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the cockpit scuttle there at the top and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.140 
the cockpit scuttle there at the top and
the<00:03:07.560> view<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> onboard<00:03:08.460> camera

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the view you get on the onboard camera

the view you get on the onboard camera
the<00:03:09.390> knees<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> driver<00:03:10.200> almost<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:11.160> if

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the knees of the driver almost as if

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.180 
the knees of the driver almost as if
he's<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.580> cart<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.260> very<00:03:13.620> classic

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
he's in a cart that is a very classic

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.000 
he's in a cart that is a very classic
Red<00:03:14.820> Bull<00:03:15.000> look<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.960> love<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.500> look<00:03:16.710> looks

really chuckle and just it all adds up

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.850 
really chuckle and just it all adds up
