00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
and fire in cinema 4d release hour 13 so
let's<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.520> started

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

here's a preview of what we are going to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.020 
here's a preview of what we are going to
do<00:00:46.829> together<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.770> lighting<00:00:50.030> doesn't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
do together I know the lighting doesn't

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.220 
do together I know the lighting doesn't
look<00:00:51.180> good<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.449> all<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.750> because<00:00:51.809> of

camstudio it messes up the lighting in
cinema<00:00:56.219> 4d<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
cinema 4d but as you can see how the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
cinema 4d but as you can see how the
fire<00:00:58.530> looks<00:00:58.770> pretty<00:00:58.980> good<00:00:59.219> its<00:00:59.430> animated<00:00:59.879> as

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
fire looks pretty good its animated as

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.740 
fire looks pretty good its animated as
well<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.120> cover<00:01:03.359> in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.410 
see in part one how to model the torch
so<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> basic<00:01:46.640> really<00:01:47.640> basic<00:01:48.119> project

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so I have a basic really basic project

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.039 
so I have a basic really basic project
file<00:01:48.780> over<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.700> way<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> modeled<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
file over here the way I modeled the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.730 
file over here the way I modeled the
torch<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.829> could<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.549> second<00:01:53.970> ago<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
torch you could see a second ago is that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
over here and took in a chemist blind

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.559 
over here and took in a chemist blind
and<00:02:07.940> started<00:02:08.940> modeling<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.400> shape<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.030> a

pretty<00:02:13.769> much<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:15.319> like<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.980> side

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
pretty much like this like the side

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.940 
pretty much like this like the side
shape<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> torch<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.959> half<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
shape of the torch like half of the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.910 
shape of the torch like half of the
shape<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.700> torch<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.239> what<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.230> with

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
shape of a torch and what you do with

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800 
shape of a torch and what you do with
that<00:02:22.950> spline<00:02:23.580> afterwards<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.299> that<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.629> go

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that spline afterwards is that you go

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.479 
that spline afterwards is that you go
back<00:02:25.110> into<00:02:25.799> your<00:02:26.129> normal<00:02:26.280> view<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.780> take

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
back into your normal view and you take

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.330 
back into your normal view and you take
the<00:02:29.489> spline<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.599> drag<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.049> into<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:32.129> light

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the spline and you drag it into a light

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.509 
the spline and you drag it into a light
NURBS<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> laners<00:02:33.900> does<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.099> kinds

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
NURBS what the laners does it it kinds

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.580 
NURBS what the laners does it it kinds
of<00:02:35.610> spins<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.540> splines<00:02:36.900> around<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
of spins the splines around and it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.420 
of spins the splines around and it
creates<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.400> modeled<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.620> creates<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.069> model

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
creates a modeled it creates a model

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.789 
creates a modeled it creates a model
based<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.510> spinning<00:02:42.780> around<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.349> that's

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
based on that spinning around and that's

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.960 
based on that spinning around and that's
what<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.640> get<00:02:44.879> over<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> that's

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
what we can get over here so that's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.190 
what we can get over here so that's
pretty<00:02:48.150> much<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.930> moment<00:02:49.579> all<00:02:50.579> right

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
pretty much it for the moment all right

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.539 
pretty much it for the moment all right
we'll<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.590> rid<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.370> have

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
we'll just get rid of that so we have

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.369 
we'll just get rid of that so we have
our<00:02:54.180> torch<00:02:55.069> over<00:02:56.069> here<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.840> way<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.109> can

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
our torch over here and the way you can

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.899 
our torch over here and the way you can
get<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.980> look<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.390> any<00:03:00.390> way<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.659> want<00:03:00.959> is

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
get it to look like any way you want is

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.490 
get it to look like any way you want is
by<00:03:02.909> selecting<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.540> spline<00:03:03.840> over<00:03:04.049> here<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
by selecting the spline over here and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.059 
by selecting the spline over here and
selecting<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:06.329> dots<00:03:06.599> so<00:03:06.989> make<00:03:07.349> sure<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.950> have

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
selecting the dots so make sure you have

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.420 
selecting the dots so make sure you have
that<00:03:08.220> selected<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> then<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.280> go<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
that selected and then you can go and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.240 
that selected and then you can go and
take<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.420> points<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.409> spline<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.069> move

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
take the points of your spline and move

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.559 
take the points of your spline and move
them<00:03:14.459> around<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.819> just<00:03:17.880> press<00:03:18.269> e<00:03:18.450> on

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
them around with like I just press e on

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.530 
them around with like I just press e on
the<00:03:19.560> keyboard<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:20.190> brings<00:03:20.489> me<00:03:20.730> these<00:03:21.000> over

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the keyboard it brings me these over

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.970 
the keyboard it brings me these over
here<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.109> move<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.560> points<00:03:22.859> around

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
here and I can move the points around

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.699 
here and I can move the points around
and<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.639> thus<00:03:24.480> modify<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.829> shape<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:27.709> my

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and I can thus modify the shape of my

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.970 
and I can thus modify the shape of my
torch<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.549> it's<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.480> easy<00:03:30.599> radiantly<00:03:31.500> if

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
torch so it's really easy radiantly if

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.800 
torch so it's really easy radiantly if
you<00:03:32.160> didn't<00:03:32.400> know<00:03:32.549> about<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.389> light<00:03:33.540> NURBS

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you didn't know about the light NURBS

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.780 
you didn't know about the light NURBS
you<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.109> use<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.040> create<00:03:35.340> all<00:03:35.579> sorts<00:03:35.609> of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
you can use it to create all sorts of

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
you can use it to create all sorts of
stuff<00:03:38.790> slide<00:03:38.970> stuff<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.200> can

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
stuff slide stuff like this you can

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.020 
stuff slide stuff like this you can
create<00:03:41.750> pretty<00:03:42.750> much<00:03:42.900> anything<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> create

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
create pretty much anything can create

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.210 
create pretty much anything can create
swords<00:03:45.139> anything<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.859> pretty<00:03:47.099> handy<00:03:48.019> now

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
swords anything so it's pretty handy now

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.879 
swords anything so it's pretty handy now
I<00:03:50.220> also<00:03:50.910> textured<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.810> torch<00:03:52.319> as<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.739> see

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
I also textured the torch as you can see

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.349 
I also textured the torch as you can see
over<00:03:52.949> here<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.940> has<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.199> kind<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.349> metal<00:03:55.799> like

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
over here it has a kind of metal like

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.170 
over here it has a kind of metal like
looking<00:03:57.359> texture<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.109> way<00:03:58.260> did<00:03:58.500> that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
looking texture in the way did that

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390 
looking texture in the way did that
we'll<00:04:00.180> go<00:04:00.389> through<00:04:00.959> this<00:04:01.109> pretty<00:04:01.680> quickly<00:04:02.010> but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
we'll go through this pretty quickly but

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.860 
we'll go through this pretty quickly but
I<00:04:02.970> added<00:04:03.569> some<00:04:03.780> bump<00:04:04.019> map<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.560> some<00:04:05.220> noise<00:04:05.870> to

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
I added some bump map and some noise to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.970 
I added some bump map and some noise to
the<00:04:06.989> bump<00:04:07.169> map<00:04:07.669> that<00:04:08.669> made<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.569> give<00:04:09.810> it

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the bump map that made it so it give it

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.349 
the bump map that made it so it give it
that<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:12.480> sort<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.379> it's<00:04:13.560> like<00:04:14.150> bumpy<00:04:15.150> look

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
that so sort of it's like bumpy look

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.920 
that so sort of it's like bumpy look
bumpy<00:04:16.139> metallic<00:04:16.739> look<00:04:17.150> some<00:04:18.150> reflection<00:04:18.810> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
bumpy metallic look some reflection is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.960 
bumpy metallic look some reflection is
also<00:04:19.169> important<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.859> put<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.459> reflection

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
also important so I put the reflection

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.630 
also important so I put the reflection
at<00:04:21.090> 22%<00:04:21.989> over<00:04:22.409> here<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.250> added<00:04:23.490> some

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
at 22% over here and I added some

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.840 
at 22% over here and I added some
specular<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.390> -<00:04:24.960> -<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.640> it<00:04:26.789> have

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
specular and - - to have it have

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.460 
specular and - - to have it have
I'm<00:04:28.850> more<00:04:29.030> realistic<00:04:29.360> look<00:04:29.720> once<00:04:29.960> again<00:04:30.050> I

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
I'm more realistic look once again I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.950 
I'm more realistic look once again I
made<00:04:30.920> it<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.640> made<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.210> specular<00:04:34.300> kinda<00:04:35.300> tight

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
made it I made the specular kinda tight

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.340 
made it I made the specular kinda tight
but<00:04:36.770> with<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> nice<00:04:37.880> height<00:04:38.240> pretty<00:04:39.020> much<00:04:39.170> like

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
but with a nice height pretty much like

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.180 
but with a nice height pretty much like
this<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.880> has<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:41.810> nice<00:04:42.850> shiny

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
this so that it has it's this nice shiny

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.890 
this so that it has it's this nice shiny
shiny<00:04:46.190> thing<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.670> its<00:04:46.820> borders<00:04:47.210> over<00:04:47.390> here<00:04:47.660> and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
shiny thing on its borders over here and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.790 
shiny thing on its borders over here and
finally<00:04:48.860> are<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.280> textures<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.060> use<00:04:50.300> is<00:04:50.630> a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
finally are the textures that I use is a

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.060 
finally are the textures that I use is a
is<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.860> layer<00:04:52.250> of<00:04:52.400> textures<00:04:53.320> I'm<00:04:54.320> not<00:04:54.560> going<00:04:54.890> to

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
is a layer of textures I'm not going to

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.670 
is a layer of textures I'm not going to
go<00:04:55.250> in<00:04:55.520> depth<00:04:55.790> how<00:04:56.570> I<00:04:56.600> did<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.080> but<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.350> can

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
go in depth how I did that but I can

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.490 
go in depth how I did that but I can
just<00:04:57.890> show<00:04:58.160> them<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.640> guys<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.900> we've<00:05:00.260> got

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
just show them to you guys so we've got

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.860 
just show them to you guys so we've got
a<00:05:00.710> small<00:05:00.920> texture<00:05:01.670> over<00:05:01.790> here<00:05:02.060> which<00:05:02.420> is<00:05:02.660> like

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
a small texture over here which is like

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.580 
a small texture over here which is like
these<00:05:03.200> brown<00:05:03.790> rusty<00:05:04.790> things<00:05:05.480> it's<00:05:06.320> kind<00:05:06.560> of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
these brown rusty things it's kind of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.430 
these brown rusty things it's kind of
rusty<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.010> little<00:05:07.220> bit<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.630> also<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:12.290> main

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
rusty a little bit and also the main

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.470 
rusty a little bit and also the main
texture<00:05:12.890> is<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.190> background<00:05:14.090> noise<00:05:14.300> so

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
texture is this background noise so

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.590 
texture is this background noise so
really<00:05:15.260> really<00:05:15.500> simple<00:05:15.860> texture<00:05:16.310> with<00:05:17.300> just

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
really really simple texture with just

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.780 
really really simple texture with just
using<00:05:17.960> some<00:05:18.200> noise<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.830> some<00:05:19.040> bump<00:05:19.310> noise<00:05:19.490> and

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
using some noise and some bump noise and

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.880 
using some noise and some bump noise and
as<00:05:19.880> you<00:05:20.000> can<00:05:20.120> see<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.570> looks<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:21.470> looks<00:05:21.530> pretty

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
as you can see it looks it looks pretty

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.060 
as you can see it looks it looks pretty
good<00:05:22.510> you<00:05:23.510> can<00:05:23.540> also<00:05:23.900> go<00:05:24.290> over<00:05:24.560> here<00:05:25.010> and

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
good you can also go over here and

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.320 
good you can also go over here and
create<00:05:25.540> low<00:05:26.540> material<00:05:26.930> preset<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.830> select

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
create low material preset and select

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.790 
create low material preset and select
going<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.450> materials<00:05:29.960> for<00:05:30.170> example<00:05:30.230> we're

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
going to materials for example we're

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.159 
going to materials for example we're
here<00:05:30.950> in<00:05:31.070> visualized<00:05:31.669> materials<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.510> select

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
here in visualized materials and select

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.040 
here in visualized materials and select
metal<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.710> then<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.550> have<00:05:34.790> all<00:05:35.120> sorts<00:05:35.900> of

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
metal and then you have all sorts of

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.610 
metal and then you have all sorts of
metal<00:05:36.410> we<00:05:37.130> can<00:05:37.160> maybe<00:05:37.790> try<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.180> in<00:05:38.360> tin<00:05:38.600> IAM<00:05:38.810> try

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
metal we can maybe try it in tin IAM try

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.070 
metal we can maybe try it in tin IAM try
this<00:05:39.680> one<00:05:40.190> over<00:05:40.310> here<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:40.730> as<00:05:41.390> you<00:05:41.510> can<00:05:41.630> see<00:05:41.690> it

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
this one over here so as you can see it

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.260 
this one over here so as you can see it
looks<00:05:42.260> why<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:43.280> doesn't<00:05:43.460> look<00:05:43.669> as<00:05:43.850> good<00:05:43.970> as<00:05:44.120> the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
looks why it doesn't look as good as the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.960 
looks why it doesn't look as good as the
texture<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.720> made<00:05:45.020> but<00:05:45.800> I<00:05:45.860> think<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.790> you

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
texture I made but I think that you

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.630 
texture I made but I think that you
understand<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.450> point<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:48.220> that's<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.430> guys

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
understand the point so that's it guys

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.970 
understand the point so that's it guys
it's<00:05:49.970> as<00:05:50.090> simple<00:05:50.240> as<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.660> we<00:05:50.900> hang<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.320> torch<00:05:51.680> a

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
it's as simple as that we hang a torch a

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.230 
it's as simple as that we hang a torch a
metallic<00:05:52.400> torch<00:05:52.640> in<00:05:52.820> cinema<00:05:53.150> 4d<00:05:54.910> in<00:05:55.910> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
metallic torch in cinema 4d in the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.170 
metallic torch in cinema 4d in the
second<00:05:56.570> video<00:05:56.690> we<00:05:56.990> are<00:05:57.110> going<00:05:57.290> to<00:05:57.470> take<00:05:57.650> a<00:05:57.680> look

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
second video we are going to take a look

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.580 
second video we are going to take a look
so<00:05:59.180> this<00:05:59.210> is<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.630> end<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.810> part<00:06:00.080> one<00:06:00.230> I'm<00:06:00.380> going

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
so this is the end of part one I'm going

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.400
