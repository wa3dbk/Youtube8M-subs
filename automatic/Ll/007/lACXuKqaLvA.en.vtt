00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
fifth power cord shake thing let me

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.450 
fifth power cord shake thing let me
slide<00:01:11.270> up<00:01:11.660> from<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> 7th<00:01:12.410> fret<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.890> 11th

then<00:01:22.179> buckle<00:01:22.840> 16th

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.470 

or<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> pick<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.970> 16

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
or actually on this one I pick the 16

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.240 
or actually on this one I pick the 16
flow<00:01:30.720> stop<00:01:30.960> picking<00:01:31.440> from<00:01:31.620> here<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.070> only

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
flow stop picking from here so it's only

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:44.600 
flow stop picking from here so it's only
a<00:01:32.370> tiny<00:01:32.580> bit<00:01:32.910> of<00:01:33.090> hybrid<00:01:33.930> picking<00:01:34.050> in<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:43.610> so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a tiny bit of hybrid picking in there so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.510 
a tiny bit of hybrid picking in there so
after<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.940> get<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:47.160> same

after we get that little that same

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.950 
after we get that little that same
pattern<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.600> pick<00:01:49.020> 17th<00:01:49.890> fret<00:01:50.479> up<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
pattern I then pick 17th fret up on the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
pattern I then pick 17th fret up on the
B<00:01:52.200> string<00:01:57.350> here<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.500> doing<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:58.950> economy

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
B string here I'm doing a little economy

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.749 
B string here I'm doing a little economy
picking<00:01:59.729> thing<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.500> plucking<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.490> the

then<00:02:21.950> I'm<00:02:22.100> hybrid<00:02:22.730> picking<00:02:22.880> again<00:02:23.360> here<00:02:24.760> or

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
then I'm hybrid picking again here or

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.960 
then I'm hybrid picking again here or
pick<00:02:26.870> whichever<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.620> easier<00:02:28.070> for<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:32.830> so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
again a little bit of economy picking

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.520 
again a little bit of economy picking
care<00:02:36.860> up<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:38.030> 16th<00:02:38.630> right<00:02:38.960> there<00:02:39.170> then

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
care up on the 16th right there then

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.590 
care up on the 16th right there then
down<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.220> B<00:02:40.430> string<00:02:40.790> 12<00:02:41.090> rep<00:02:43.300> slowed<00:02:44.300> up<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
down to the B string 12 rep slowed up to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:55.930 
down to the B string 12 rep slowed up to
the<00:02:44.690> 14th<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:47.060> picking<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> 17<00:02:54.250> 17<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:55.610> down
