from a stonemasons point of view now

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.310 
from a stonemasons point of view now
this<00:00:16.820> building<00:00:17.270> was<00:00:17.420> built<00:00:17.449> out<00:00:17.840> of<00:00:17.960> Ohio

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
this building was built out of Ohio

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.190 
this building was built out of Ohio
sandstone<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.910> was<00:00:20.029> built<00:00:20.270> on<00:00:20.450> a<00:00:20.509> marble<00:00:20.869> in

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
sandstone it was built on a marble in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.890 
sandstone it was built on a marble in
the<00:00:21.320> inside<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:22.099> granite<00:00:22.970> around<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.570> steps

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
the inside and granite around the steps

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.290 
the inside and granite around the steps
in<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.500> water<00:00:24.739> table<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.910> we're<00:00:26.060> going<00:00:26.090> to

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
in the water table and we're going to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.049 
in the water table and we're going to
take<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.480> look<00:00:26.719> at<00:00:26.840> stones<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.649> why<00:00:28.520> Mason's

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:29.059 
take a look at stones and why Mason's

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.970 
take a look at stones and why Mason's
use<00:00:29.239> certain<00:00:29.660> stones<00:00:29.989> where<00:00:30.439> they<00:00:30.590> get<00:00:30.829> them

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
use certain stones where they get them

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.979 
use certain stones where they get them
from<00:00:31.180> what<00:00:32.180> they're<00:00:32.360> thinking<00:00:32.780> what<00:00:32.930> they're

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
from what they're thinking what they're

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.530 
from what they're thinking what they're
using<00:00:33.350> that's<00:00:34.129> just<00:00:34.370> a<00:00:34.489> basic<00:00:34.730> idea<00:00:35.360> of

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
using that's just a basic idea of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.170 
using that's just a basic idea of
stonework<00:00:36.140> now<00:00:37.100> in<00:00:37.250> this<00:00:37.370> video<00:00:37.610> we're<00:00:38.059> going

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
stonework now in this video we're going

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.270 
stonework now in this video we're going
to<00:00:38.239> look<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.480> all<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.780> different<00:00:38.930> stones<00:00:39.410> here

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
to look at all the different stones here

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.119 
to look at all the different stones here
we<00:00:40.430> have<00:00:40.610> Coquina<00:00:41.379> we<00:00:42.379> have<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.559> sample<00:00:43.039> of

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
we have Coquina we have a sample of

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.540 
we have Coquina we have a sample of
coral<00:00:43.780> we<00:00:44.780> have<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.019> sample<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.649> limestone<00:00:45.890> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
coral we have a sample of limestone and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.989 
coral we have a sample of limestone and
over<00:00:47.480> here<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:47.989> have<00:00:48.109> all<00:00:48.379> different<00:00:48.649> types<00:00:49.129> of

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
over here we have all different types of

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.470 
over here we have all different types of
what<00:00:50.329> we<00:00:50.449> call<00:00:50.719> sandstone<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:52.179> then<00:00:53.179> when<00:00:53.359> we

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
what we call sandstone and then when we

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.919 
what we call sandstone and then when we
get<00:00:53.659> over<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.050> here<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:55.489> have<00:00:55.729> a<00:00:55.760> sample<00:00:56.659> of

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
get over in here we have a sample of

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.380 
get over in here we have a sample of
marble<00:00:57.409> we<00:00:58.309> have<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> couple<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.879> samples<00:00:59.269> of

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
marble we have a couple of samples of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.559 
marble we have a couple of samples of
granite<00:00:59.839> and<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.620> couple<00:01:01.039> samples<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:02.239> slate

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
granite and a couple samples of slate

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.689 
granite and a couple samples of slate
and<00:01:02.809> these<00:01:03.559> are<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.070> stones<00:01:04.280> we're<00:01:04.519> going<00:01:04.640> to

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
and these are the stones we're going to

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.540 
and these are the stones we're going to
take<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> look<00:01:05.089> at<00:01:05.330> now<00:01:05.720> people<00:01:06.170> ask<00:01:06.380> me<00:01:06.710> what<00:01:07.430> is

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
take a look at now people ask me what is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.420 
take a look at now people ask me what is
the<00:01:07.580> difference<00:01:07.970> between<00:01:08.000> limestone<00:01:08.870> and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
the difference between limestone and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.940 
the difference between limestone and
sandstone<00:01:10.690> best<00:01:11.690> way<00:01:11.900> for<00:01:12.140> me<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.260> explain<00:01:12.650> it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
sandstone best way for me to explain it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.330 
sandstone best way for me to explain it
is<00:01:13.430> God<00:01:13.760> made<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.330> out<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.350> seashells<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
is God made this out of seashells and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.030 
is God made this out of seashells and
marine<00:01:16.610> life<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.180> God<00:01:18.020> made<00:01:18.320> sandstone

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
marine life and God made sandstone

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.790 
marine life and God made sandstone
basically<00:01:19.670> out<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.850> sand<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:21.290> that's<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.650> way

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
basically out of sand so that's the way

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.970 
basically out of sand so that's the way
we<00:01:21.950> look<00:01:22.100> at<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.370> so<00:01:23.330> this<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.830> 95%<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
we look at it so this is 95% of the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.730 
we look at it so this is 95% of the
stone<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.280> use<00:01:25.640> as<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.880> mason<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:27.470> first

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
stone I use as a mason and the first

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.530 
stone I use as a mason and the first
stone<00:01:28.010> we're<00:01:28.160> going<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.340> look<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.940> Coquina

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
stone we're going to look at is Coquina

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.280 
stone we're going to look at is Coquina
now<00:01:30.440> we're<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:30.740> st.<00:01:31.010> Augustine<00:01:31.700> Florida<00:01:32.290> this

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
now we're in st. Augustine Florida this

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.010 
now we're in st. Augustine Florida this
port<00:01:33.830> right<00:01:34.370> here<00:01:34.400> was<00:01:34.850> built<00:01:35.150> out<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.690> shell

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
port right here was built out of a shell

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.380 
port right here was built out of a shell
stone<00:01:36.380> called<00:01:36.830> Coquina<00:01:37.400> knee<00:01:37.730> quarried<00:01:38.210> it

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
stone called Coquina knee quarried it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.090 
stone called Coquina knee quarried it
I'm<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.170> show<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.530> little<00:01:39.770> bit<00:01:39.890> more

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
I'm going to show you a little bit more

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.720 
I'm going to show you a little bit more
about<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:41.710> now<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.740> little<00:01:42.980> bit<00:01:43.250> more<00:01:43.490> about

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
about it now a little bit more about

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.990 
about it now a little bit more about
Coquina<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.900> see<00:01:45.140> all<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.800> basically

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
Coquina you see all it is is basically

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.850 
Coquina you see all it is is basically
seashells<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:47.930> packed<00:01:48.230> real<00:01:48.530> tight

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
seashells and it's packed real tight

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.340 
seashells and it's packed real tight
together<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.670> they<00:01:50.240> quarried<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.200> they

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
together and they quarried this and they

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.770 
together and they quarried this and they
built<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.770> whole<00:01:52.040> fort<00:01:52.400> out<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.700> it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.260 

you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:10.870 

you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.450 

well<00:02:11.540> we<00:02:11.690> basically<00:02:12.110> looked<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.590> Coquina<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
well we basically looked at Coquina and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.820 
well we basically looked at Coquina and
you<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.600> seashells<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.470> there<00:02:15.650> it's

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
you can see the seashells in there it's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.270 
you can see the seashells in there it's
very<00:02:15.890> easy<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.900> break<00:02:18.250> sea<00:02:19.270> miles<00:02:20.270> apart<00:02:20.720> easy

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
stone and in the decent do it you're too

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:37.750 
stone and in the decent do it you're too
lazy<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.460> how<00:02:37.610> they

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
lazy to do that and that is how they

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.740 
lazy to do that and that is how they
make<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.020> smoother<00:02:39.020> surface<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:41.360> we're<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
make a smoother surface now we're in the

Florida Keys in Isla Virata Florida this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.380 
Florida Keys in Isla Virata Florida this
is<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.860> hurricane<00:02:45.860> Monument<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.150> whole

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
is the hurricane Monument and this whole

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.500 
is the hurricane Monument and this whole
manual<00:02:48.020> was<00:02:48.230> built<00:02:48.470> out<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.710> coral<00:02:49.220> rock<00:02:49.510> but

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
manual was built out of coral rock but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.570 
manual was built out of coral rock but
because<00:02:51.140> all<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.680> keys<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.160> made<00:02:52.370> out<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
because all the keys is made out of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.360 
because all the keys is made out of
coral<00:02:53.120> that's<00:02:53.990> why<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.410> use<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.740> stone<00:02:55.010> here

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
coral that's why they use the stone here

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.740 
coral that's why they use the stone here
but<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.910> goes<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.300> show<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.570> how

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
but it just goes to show you how

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.380 
but it just goes to show you how
different<00:02:56.960> masons<00:02:57.680> use<00:02:57.860> different<00:02:58.310> stones<00:02:58.610> in

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
different masons use different stones in

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.740 
different masons use different stones in
different<00:02:59.840> areas<00:03:00.970> well<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.480> some

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
different areas well here we have some

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.070 
different areas well here we have some
chunks<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.320> coral<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:05.090> can<00:03:05.270> look<00:03:05.480> at<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.930> and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
chunks of coral you can look at it and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.070 
chunks of coral you can look at it and
see<00:03:06.320> what<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.560> looks<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.630> come<00:03:08.900> up

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
see what it looks like then we come up

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.260 
see what it looks like then we come up
here<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.620> can<00:03:09.770> see<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> fossils<00:03:10.670> inside<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
here you can see the fossils inside the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.800 
here you can see the fossils inside the
coral<00:03:12.250> these<00:03:13.250> guys<00:03:13.610> just<00:03:13.910> laid<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.330> ran<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
coral these guys just laid it ran and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.840 
coral these guys just laid it ran and
just<00:03:14.930> put<00:03:15.170> chunks<00:03:15.620> on<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.310> put<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:16.820> that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
just put chunks on and put it like that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.470 
just put chunks on and put it like that
now<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:17.930> shows<00:03:18.260> right<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:19.010> how<00:03:19.760> every

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
now this just shows right here how every

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.500 
now this just shows right here how every
mason<00:03:20.900> does<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.230> different<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.180> see

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
mason does it different and you can see

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.570 
mason does it different and you can see
the<00:03:23.630> top<00:03:23.870> where<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.200> was<00:03:24.350> cut<00:03:24.650> these<00:03:25.250> top

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
the top where it was cut these top

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.460 
the top where it was cut these top
pieces<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.240> here<00:03:26.510> was<00:03:26.660> I'll<00:03:26.810> put<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.200> random

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
pieces in here was I'll put in random

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.030 
pieces in here was I'll put in random
but<00:03:28.370> flat<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.940> has<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.210> flat<00:03:29.480> look<00:03:29.750> now<00:03:30.740> here's

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
but flat it has the flat look now here's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.780 
but flat it has the flat look now here's
an<00:03:31.250> example<00:03:31.370> where<00:03:32.330> they<00:03:32.480> cut<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.960> with<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> saw

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
an example where they cut it with a saw

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.400 
an example where they cut it with a saw
flatten<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.850> out<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.330> then<00:03:35.600> they<00:03:35.720> cut<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.080> to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
flatten it out and then they cut it to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.430 
flatten it out and then they cut it to
make<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.550> pattern<00:03:37.880> stone<00:03:38.420> there's<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.200> lot<00:03:39.320> of

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
make a pattern stone there's a lot of

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
make a pattern stone there's a lot of
different<00:03:39.800> ways<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.370> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.420

the video called Coral Castle visit now
here<00:04:05.040> we<00:04:05.159> have<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> couple<00:04:05.790> pieces<00:04:05.969> of

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
here we have a couple pieces of

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.809 
here we have a couple pieces of
limestone<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.219> you<00:04:08.219> can<00:04:08.340> see<00:04:08.549> where<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.730> took

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
limestone and you can see where I took

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.300 
limestone and you can see where I took
this<00:04:09.180> off<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> set<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.349> old<00:04:10.500> steps<00:04:10.920> or<00:04:11.159> it<00:04:11.219> gets

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
this off a set of old steps or it gets

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.979 
this off a set of old steps or it gets
pitted<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:11.969> it<00:04:12.060> wears<00:04:12.209> away<00:04:12.450> just<00:04:12.870> like

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
pitted and it wears away just like

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.099 
pitted and it wears away just like
anything<00:04:13.319> especially<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.189> Pennsylvania<00:04:15.109> but

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
anything especially in Pennsylvania but

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.400 
anything especially in Pennsylvania but
it's<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.979> very<00:04:17.160> soft<00:04:17.489> stone<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.049> using<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
it's a very soft stone if you using the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.039 
it's a very soft stone if you using the
point<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> hammered<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:21.419> doesn't<00:04:21.840> cut

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
point of the hammered it doesn't cut

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.870 
point of the hammered it doesn't cut
deep<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.650> could<00:04:22.770> face<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:25.880> once

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
deep you could face it like that once

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.360 
deep you could face it like that once
they<00:04:27.000> hit<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> hard<00:04:27.620> if<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.830> want<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.130> stone

they hit it hard if you want to stone

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.670 
they hit it hard if you want to stone
the<00:04:29.550> cut<00:04:29.759> down<00:04:30.030> use<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:30.960> part<00:04:31.259> of<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.440> hammer

the cut down use this part of the hammer

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.060 
the cut down use this part of the hammer
and<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.880> cut<00:04:33.090> straight<00:04:33.360> down<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.870> see<00:04:34.080> I'll<00:04:34.889> go

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
and a cut straight down you see I'll go

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.939 
and a cut straight down you see I'll go
into<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.340> deeper<00:04:35.880> with<00:04:36.030> some<00:04:36.710> chisels<00:04:37.710> later

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949

on<00:04:38.220> don't<00:04:38.849> know<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.389> just<00:04:39.449> carved<00:04:39.960> us<00:04:40.080> out

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
on don't know this I just carved us out

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.469 
on don't know this I just carved us out
with<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.560> saw<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.849> show<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.120> how<00:04:42.330> they

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
with the saw just to show you how they

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.770 
with the saw just to show you how they
do<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:43.280> on<00:04:44.280> cathedrals<00:04:45.000> but<00:04:45.449> it's<00:04:45.539> a<00:04:45.599> very

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
do it in on cathedrals but it's a very

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.170 
do it in on cathedrals but it's a very
soft<00:04:46.169> stone<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:47.550> could<00:04:47.699> actually<00:04:47.880> just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
soft stone you could actually just

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.379 
soft stone you could actually just
scrape<00:04:48.539> it<00:04:48.660> with<00:04:48.840> your<00:04:48.960> screwdriver<00:04:50.389> you

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
scrape it with your screwdriver you

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.270 
scrape it with your screwdriver you
could<00:04:51.570> get<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.720> file<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.620> file<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:56.070> make<00:04:56.250> a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
could get a file and file it to make a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:06.510 
could get a file and file it to make a
do<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.729> for<00:04:56.940> one<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.330> could<00:04:57.509> side<00:04:57.810> like<00:04:58.740> this

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.040 

that's<00:05:07.520> just<00:05:07.879> for<00:05:08.060> an<00:05:08.120> example<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:08.930> is

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
that's just for an example but this is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.769 
that's just for an example but this is
what<00:05:09.169> they<00:05:09.319> build<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.770> cathedrals<00:05:10.490> out<00:05:10.669> of<00:05:10.849> so

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
what they build the cathedrals out of so

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.709 
what they build the cathedrals out of so
it's<00:05:12.529> a<00:05:12.620> very<00:05:12.830> widely<00:05:13.159> used<00:05:13.370> stone<00:05:13.939> i<00:05:14.300> wouldn't

it's a very widely used stone i wouldn't

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.170 
it's a very widely used stone i wouldn't

how to carve the stones the buildings
been<00:05:46.370> being<00:05:46.610> built<00:05:46.909> for<00:05:47.150> over<00:05:47.479> a<00:05:47.509> hundred

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
been being built for over a hundred

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.679 
been being built for over a hundred
years<00:05:48.639> they<00:05:49.639> stopped<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.150> couple<00:05:50.300> times

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689 
years they stopped a couple times

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.990 
years they stopped a couple times
because<00:05:50.960> of<00:05:51.259> the<00:05:51.319> world<00:05:51.560> wars<00:05:51.889> but<00:05:52.610> it's<00:05:52.759> still

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
because of the world wars but it's still

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.670 
because of the world wars but it's still
being<00:05:53.180> built<00:05:53.539> today<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.169> it's<00:05:54.319> a<00:05:54.439> good

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
being built today and it's a good

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.850 
being built today and it's a good
example<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:55.430> a<00:05:55.699> limestone<00:05:56.270> building<00:05:56.860> right

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
example of a limestone building right

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.379 
example of a limestone building right
here<00:05:58.099> you<00:05:58.219> can<00:05:58.400> see<00:05:58.430> where<00:05:58.819> they<00:05:58.879> use<00:05:59.029> rough

here you can see where they use rough

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.379 
here you can see where they use rough
stones<00:05:59.750> behind<00:06:00.439> the<00:06:01.249> facade<00:06:01.669> which<00:06:02.029> is<00:06:02.180> going

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
stones behind the facade which is going

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.769 
stones behind the facade which is going
to<00:06:02.479> be<00:06:02.740> limestone<00:06:03.819> so<00:06:04.819> it's<00:06:04.999> a<00:06:05.060> good<00:06:05.180> example

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
to be limestone so it's a good example

how<00:06:34.729> to<00:06:34.759> build<00:06:35.180> arches<00:06:35.779> so<00:06:36.289> if<00:06:36.439> you're

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
how to build arches so if you're

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.909 
how to build arches so if you're
interested<00:06:36.860> in<00:06:37.250> that<00:06:37.279> looked<00:06:37.729> at<00:06:37.909> up

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.789 

that's<00:06:42.919> how<00:06:43.129> you<00:06:43.189> restore<00:06:43.879> old<00:06:44.059> mine<00:06:44.269> stone<00:06:44.799> to

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:45.799 
that's how you restore old mine stone to

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:50.349 
that's how you restore old mine stone to
make<00:06:45.919> it<00:06:46.099> look<00:06:46.219> new<00:06:48.579> now<00:06:49.579> here's<00:06:49.789> a<00:06:49.879> perfect

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:50.359 
make it look new now here's a perfect

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.229 
make it look new now here's a perfect
example<00:06:50.509> of<00:06:51.109> what<00:06:51.289> happens<00:06:51.649> limestone<00:06:52.309> when

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:53.239 
example of what happens limestone when

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:55.059 
example of what happens limestone when
you<00:06:53.359> lay<00:06:53.509> it<00:06:53.569> on<00:06:53.749> the<00:06:53.869> ground<00:06:53.899> in<00:06:54.289> Pennsylvania

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
you lay it on the ground in Pennsylvania

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.699 
you lay it on the ground in Pennsylvania
and<00:06:55.249> it<00:06:55.849> absorbs<00:06:56.329> water<00:06:56.569> and<00:06:56.809> it<00:06:57.049> freezes<00:06:57.529> and

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:57.709 
and it absorbs water and it freezes and

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.069 
and it absorbs water and it freezes and
it<00:06:57.979> disintegrates<00:06:58.639> it's<00:06:59.419> okay<00:06:59.749> if<00:06:59.869> it's<00:07:00.019> not

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.079 
it disintegrates it's okay if it's not

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.719 
it disintegrates it's okay if it's not
laying<00:07:00.439> on<00:07:00.619> the<00:07:00.709> ground<00:07:00.919> but<00:07:01.249> when<00:07:01.339> lays<00:07:01.549> in

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
laying on the ground but when lays in

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.059 
laying on the ground but when lays in
water<00:07:01.969> it'll<00:07:02.479> disintegrate<00:07:02.869> now<00:07:03.769> we<00:07:03.829> looked

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069 
water it'll disintegrate now we looked

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.399 
water it'll disintegrate now we looked

God<00:07:21.949> did<00:07:22.159> make<00:07:22.339> everything<00:07:22.639> black<00:07:23.029> and<00:07:23.059> white

God did make everything black and white
and<00:07:23.719> there's<00:07:23.899> an<00:07:23.989> exception<00:07:24.379> to<00:07:24.559> every<00:07:24.709> role

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:25.209

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:28.629 
and there's an exception to every role
but<00:07:26.229> next<00:07:27.229> time<00:07:27.469> we<00:07:27.589> get<00:07:27.709> into<00:07:27.919> sandstone<00:07:28.610> a

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
but next time we get into sandstone a

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.089 
but next time we get into sandstone a
little<00:07:28.969> deeper<00:07:29.389> and<00:07:29.659> this<00:07:30.589> is<00:07:30.739> the<00:07:30.829> end<00:07:30.979> of
