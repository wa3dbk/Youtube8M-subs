00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
for the zoom and also coming soon for

itself functions slightly differently in
the<00:01:10.400> past<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.850> was<00:01:10.910> like<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.119> scissors<00:01:11.509> action

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
the past it was like a scissors action

two different angles a very upright

two different angles a very upright
viewing<00:01:16.700> angle<00:01:17.140> just<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.470> good<00:01:18.860> for

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
viewing angle just like that good for

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.340 
viewing angle just like that good for
typing<00:01:19.580> or<00:01:19.880> put<00:01:20.600> an<00:01:20.659> even<00:01:20.869> better<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:21.289> for

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
typing comes right here sitting a little

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.740 
typing comes right here sitting a little
bit<00:01:24.830> lower<00:01:25.039> than<00:01:25.610> any<00:01:25.789> tablet<00:01:26.240> option<00:01:26.570> we've

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
bit lower than any tablet option we've

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.600 
bit lower than any tablet option we've
offered<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.259> past<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.460> your

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
offered in the past so you have your

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.210 
offered in the past so you have your
pick<00:01:28.789> between<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.300> two<00:01:29.530> either<00:01:30.530> one<00:01:30.860> whatever

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
pick between the two either one whatever

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.270 
pick between the two either one whatever
works<00:01:31.520> best<00:01:32.289> additionally<00:01:33.289> for<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:33.619> taking

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
works best additionally for that taking

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.529 
works best additionally for that taking
in<00:01:34.399> some<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.880> business<00:01:35.149> intelligence

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
in some of that business intelligence

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.320 
in some of that business intelligence
and<00:01:35.960> research<00:01:36.890> based<00:01:37.340> off<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.580> our<00:01:37.880> previous

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
and research based off of our previous

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.740 
and research based off of our previous
tablet<00:01:38.960> cases<00:01:39.160> we've<00:01:40.160> added<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.060> option<00:01:41.090> for

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
tablet cases we've added the option for

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490 
tablet cases we've added the option for
a<00:01:41.780> small<00:01:42.520> dock<00:01:43.520> door<00:01:43.789> on<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.240> back<00:01:44.390> flips<00:01:45.350> out

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
a small dock door on the back flips out

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.109 
a small dock door on the back flips out
of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.740> way<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.970> also<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:48.259> much<00:01:49.220> larger<00:01:49.700> access

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
of the way and also a much larger access

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.419 
of the way and also a much larger access
point<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.110> won't<00:01:51.350> actually<00:01:51.649> slide<00:01:52.190> off

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
point so this won't actually slide off

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.650 
point so this won't actually slide off
the<00:01:52.610> back<00:01:52.759> if<00:01:52.970> you're<00:01:53.119> familiar<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:53.509> our

from the case of stuff that is actually
a<00:02:02.539> fairly<00:02:03.229> good<00:02:03.500> input

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
a fairly good input

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.070 
a fairly good input
because<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.820> remember<00:02:06.090> having<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
actual back right here does just pull

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.490 
actual back right here does just pull
and<00:02:11.910> slide<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.330> off<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.960> could<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.230> lost

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and slide right off it could be lost

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
and slide right off it could be lost
could<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.920> misplaced<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.150> chew

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
could be misplaced it's all I can chew

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.810 
could be misplaced it's all I can chew
it<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.570> something<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.700> know

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
it up something like that but you know

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.760 
it up something like that but you know
with<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> actually<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.600> hinging<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.590> off

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770

as you can see right here that's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
as you can see right here that's
definitely<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.170> much<00:02:22.380> better<00:02:23.270> designed<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
definitely a much better designed and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
possible that was one of the things that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.210 
possible that was one of the things that
they<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.290> called<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.680> our<00:02:34.800> attentions

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.410 
they really called to our attentions
that<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.460> did<00:02:35.580> not<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.000> remove<00:02:36.270> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that they did not want to remove that
