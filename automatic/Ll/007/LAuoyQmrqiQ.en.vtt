00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that is one of the the patients who came

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
that is one of the the patients who came
in<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.610> she's<00:01:56.820> already<00:01:57.060> had<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.930> done

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in here and she's already had this done

this is Annette before and let's come
back<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.020> live<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.829> she<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.070> after

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
back out here live and here she is after

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
back out here live and here she is after
tell<00:02:02.790> us<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> difference<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.780> obvious

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tell us the difference here it's obvious

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.630 
tell us the difference here it's obvious
and<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> turn<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.100> face<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and we're going to turn your face just a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.300 
and we're going to turn your face just a
little<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.840> angle

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
little because it's kind of a side angle

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.979 
little because it's kind of a side angle
what's<00:02:08.310> obvious<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> volume<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what's obvious is the volume in the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.620 
what's obvious is the volume in the
cheeks<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.300> loom

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
cheeks up here that have a loom

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
cheeks up here that have a loom
we<00:02:13.200> did<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> little<00:02:13.530> Juvederm<00:02:14.040> down<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.460> for

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
we did a little Juvederm down here for

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
we did a little Juvederm down here for
some<00:02:14.760> lines<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.210> wrinkles<00:02:15.570> there<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.900> well

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
some lines and wrinkles there as well

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.440 
some lines and wrinkles there as well
but<00:02:16.710> what's<00:02:16.950> obvious<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.790> everything<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
but what's obvious is that everything is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.330 
but what's obvious is that everything is
lifted<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> patient<00:02:20.190> will

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
lifted when I do this on a patient will

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
lifted when I do this on a patient will
do<00:02:20.490> between<00:02:20.670> two<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.270> four<00:02:21.420> syringes<00:02:21.990> they

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
do between two to four syringes they

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
do between two to four syringes they
look<00:02:22.740> at<00:02:22.860> Amir<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.280> go<00:02:23.430> WOW<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.970> eyes

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
look at Amir and they go WOW my eyes

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
look at Amir and they go WOW my eyes
look<00:02:24.480> brighter<00:02:24.750> my<00:02:25.020> eyes<00:02:25.170> look<00:02:25.500> more<00:02:25.650> open<00:02:25.710> and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
look brighter my eyes look more open and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.790 
look brighter my eyes look more open and
that<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.540> something<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.320> not<00:02:28.530> been

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
that is something that we have not been

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.630 
that is something that we have not been
able<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> recreate<00:02:29.490> before<00:02:30.420> November<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:32.490> also

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
able to recreate before November it also

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.310 
able to recreate before November it also
lasts<00:02:33.000> two<00:02:33.240> years<00:02:33.270> yeah<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.110> know<00:02:34.200> what

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
lasts two years yeah and you know what

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.260 
lasts two years yeah and you know what
it<00:02:34.440> doesn't<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.860> pulp<00:02:35.220> look<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
it doesn't have that pulp look which is

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.150 
it doesn't have that pulp look which is
the<00:02:36.390> problem<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.320> lifting<00:02:37.680> from<00:02:37.860> beneath

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the problem it's lifting from beneath

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.010 
the problem it's lifting from beneath
some<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.880> most<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.690> my<00:02:39.780> patients

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
some of it and most of my patients

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.780 
some of it and most of my patients
because<00:02:40.440> we're<00:02:40.650> non-invasive<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.460> don't<00:02:41.640> do

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because we're non-invasive we don't do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.730 
because we're non-invasive we don't do
surgery<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.660> fillers<00:02:42.990> botox<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.620> laser

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
surgery we do fillers botox and laser

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.980 
surgery we do fillers botox and laser
they<00:02:44.340> want<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.640> look<00:02:44.760> natural<00:02:45.240> they<00:02:45.690> want<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
they want to look natural they want to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.930 
they want to look natural they want to
look<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.290> themselves<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.070> they<00:02:47.520> don't<00:02:47.760> want

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
look like themselves and they don't want

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.160 
look like themselves and they don't want
anyone<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> they<00:02:48.570> had<00:02:48.690> something<00:02:48.900> done
