00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 cinnamon from the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.520
 never 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.440
 well a big loss was no longer part 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 of mexican christian benitez soccer 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 although he had expressed his desire to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 that maybe at some point taking 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.690
 in mind how young I was 27 years go to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.500
 try my luck to qatar I thought I was going 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
 the future holds 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 maybe go back to European football or 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.519
 of having returned to Mexican soccer in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 where there are two teams where he left 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 Roberto said it a well-marked footprint 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 one of the best forwards that has 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.500
 touched to see in Mexican football a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 exceptional player who had out there and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.270
 his subjects inside the club good that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 can be but also what he left in the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.790
 court the professionalism a huge 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.690
 number of goals scoring titles 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 championships for the teams in which 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 participated with the possibility in addition to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 be a relevant game for the selection 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.309
 from his country with which he was walking 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 heading to the world cup a very player 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 important not only in Mexico but 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 throughout the American continent with 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 experience and even having played 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.520
 the premier league of england 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.770
 a man who was a four-time scoring champion 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.110
 of national football and that was also 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.210
 raising important cups for both 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.270
 santos lagoon and for the group of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.369
 eagles 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.750
 we can not say or rather to me 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 understand is one of the best 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.679
 front who has had the history of 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.909
 club america and that have been many 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.950
 many the good players he has 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.539
 gone through this coapa team a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.819
 Sensitive loss for Mexican soccer 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.259
 also because we are not aware of 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.210
 the fragility of the human being and for 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.950
 supposedly resignation for the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.780
 family a great athlete of a bad being 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 human and of course a great idol 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.890
 that today loses the americanista and good 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 without doubts and also there in the lagoon 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.689

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.310
