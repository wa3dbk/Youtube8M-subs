00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.889
 will be a small tour de force or with advanced techniques 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.289
 we will start from this photo here 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.779

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.419
 the first technique consists of umbrella converting a photo that shakes the pore 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.220
 the bell ringer 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 we open our file inside a manager and then first command me command 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 arrives on mac I checked r on windows 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100
 so the camerano interface 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.340
 we get married inside the hsl gray scale panel 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 select the option convert gray scale 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.360

 black and white 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 if within the preferences of dear 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.360
 ep ticked applies the mix of gray scale tomati qatar la 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.200
 gray scale conversion 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.320
 we will get the same effect 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 otherwise 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.050
 we remove construction we give that is in you 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.910
 we remove check mark here 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.730
 heroes please 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.970
 he does not apply automatic oranges but sets all year zero values 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.270
 I usually don't recommend turning off promotion and then 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 we will go - 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.000
 ok 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 we resume on convert grayscale 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 ah. I told you that the chamber was an optimization 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.940
 of all colors 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.370
 and we can go to change manually 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 all the voices then 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 are moving the hotel slider to the lawn 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.180
 so as you see 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.520
 the lighter lawn 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 hey the lawn so darker 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.880
 or 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 pedicel 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.189
 sorry bad thing 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:22.979
 as you can see this technique produces a lot of noise especially in the macbeth photos 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.509
 raised arrigons 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.899
 let's say it's not the best though if you have to and 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:35.669
 work exclusively on we will do without adobe photoshop cook this live art 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.319
 and the best technique 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.089
 so I don't know I can't advise you to set here 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.279
 the mixture as you see fit 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.919
 so if we want more contrast only to 'so him 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:54.939
 to go then 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.489
 to play 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.749
 with curves then for lights 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.519
 light colors 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.909
 dark colors 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 apply more or less contrast to the photo 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.909
 series b you don't want to stay away from going crazy the common on mix scale panel of 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.680
 gray you can use the 2 and the tool treats 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.389
 ket is here, here it is 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.359
 hold down run he and the gray scale already set index 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.609
 the tool done 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.849
 it is similar to the hand tool found in the pandoro le photoshop curves 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:35.879
 It allows 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:42.459
 user to select a color within the photograph and go to it 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.349
 modify 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.859
 raising the mouse a little or I'll show you right away 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.299
 I don't know if we want to darken a part of the sky 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.559
 a part and blue we click with the mouse on this. 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 lower the cursor 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.479
 ok 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.600
 as you can see he has already selected the blue dog 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600
 king of the blue 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.459
 we are modified 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.120
 we can even if flop increases ok 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.419
 and so on we can 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.609
 use for all colors 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.539
 the tattoo tool very very intuitive tool n 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.819
 not only beautiful in black and white we can also use it in 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.240
 photo colors for it is to add or remove contrast 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.150
 % life is so on 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
 we move under its darts 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.480
 drag the mouse now left 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.059
 watch 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:45.529
 so 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.349
 we can do it from here and as you see now I'm changing the purple values 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.270
 magenta 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.080
 ok 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.090
 we can come back again 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.389
 on the sky here furnish some more 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.839
 brightness 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.110
 but as I said this heat this 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.599
 this technique 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.039
 and it is above all applies raige takes produces a lot of noise is the advice 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.789
 only if you have a root file 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.240
 which then do not switch from photoshop or then do the conversion above 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.590
 otherwise but there are other techniques we see in a while 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.009
 on how to convert even black with photoshop in mind 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.629
 At this point we are done 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.589
 ncs to close the photograph 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.609
 and pyrotechnics has been cultivated
