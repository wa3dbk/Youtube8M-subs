00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
was talking about this core 5.3 block

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.270 
was talking about this core 5.3 block
this<00:00:13.080> quarter<00:00:13.500> everybody<00:00:13.920> remembers<00:00:14.160> this

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this quarter everybody remembers this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
this quarter everybody remembers this
quarter<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.389> full<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> water<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
quarter that was full of water and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.900 
quarter that was full of water and
talked<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.279> getting<00:00:17.430> rid<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.789> out

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
talked about getting rid of it get out

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.269 
talked about getting rid of it get out
of<00:00:18.000> my<00:00:18.090> garage<00:00:18.289> well<00:00:19.289> yesterday<00:00:19.980> while

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of my garage well yesterday while

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.740 
of my garage well yesterday while
rearranging<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:20.910> unloading<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> engine<00:00:21.600> for

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
rearranging and unloading the engine for

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.910 
rearranging and unloading the engine for
the<00:00:21.869> c10<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:24.300> spark<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.840> idea<00:00:25.140> light<00:00:25.680> bulb

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the c10 the spark this idea light bulb

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.750 
the c10 the spark this idea light bulb
popped<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.369> head

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
popped in my head

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.859 
popped in my head
and<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:28.130> think<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.240> cool<00:00:30.449> if<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.660> took

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and I think it would be cool if we took

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.310 
and I think it would be cool if we took
this<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.560> those<00:00:31.740> two<00:00:31.890> rusted<00:00:32.250> cylinders

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
this and those two rusted cylinders

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.170 
this and those two rusted cylinders
sandpapered<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> rust<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> where

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
sandpapered out the rust got it to where

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.770 
sandpapered out the rust got it to where
it<00:00:36.239> could<00:00:36.329> rotate<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.450> thing<00:00:39.600> back

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it could rotate and put this thing back

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
it could rotate and put this thing back
together<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.410> ran<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.550> an<00:00:41.670> engine<00:00:41.910> stand

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
together and ran it on an engine stand

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.720 
together and ran it on an engine stand
like<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> test<00:00:42.719> stand<00:00:43.160> not<00:00:44.160> only<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.520> be

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
like a test stand not only would that be

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.979 
like a test stand not only would that be
a<00:00:44.760> cool<00:00:45.000> experiment<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:45.660> much<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
a cool experiment to see how much it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
a cool experiment to see how much it
smoked<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.440> long<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> lasted<00:00:47.690> but<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
smoked how long it lasted but also it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189 
smoked how long it lasted but also it
would<00:00:49.620> give<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> y'all<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.480> set<00:00:52.050> up

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
would give it all of y'all a good set up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.979 
would give it all of y'all a good set up
idea<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> harness<00:00:54.510> goes<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
idea of how the harness goes and what it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
idea of how the harness goes and what it
takes<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.590> engine<00:00:55.860> run<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
takes to make this engine run and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
takes to make this engine run and
anything<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.829> last<00:01:02.039> night<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
anything pretty much so so last night I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
anything pretty much so so last night I
got<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.149> excited<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> idea<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
got really excited about the idea I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710 
got really excited about the idea I
guess<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> sanded<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
guess I got in there and sanded out the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.350 
guess I got in there and sanded out the
rust<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.310> those<00:01:08.310> two<00:01:08.520> cylinders<00:01:11.090> that's<00:01:12.090> what

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
rust in those two cylinders that's what

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
rust in those two cylinders that's what
it's<00:01:12.510> looking<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.840> let's<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.500> here's<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it's looking like let's see here's the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
it's looking like let's see here's the
rough<00:01:14.040> spot<00:01:18.680> yeah<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> ain't<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.020> I've

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rough spot yeah it ain't pretty but I've

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.760 
rough spot yeah it ain't pretty but I've
got<00:01:22.259> faith

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
got faith

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
got faith
I<00:01:22.799> bet<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.310> thing's<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.670> run<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:24.630> might

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I bet this thing's gonna run we might

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.550 
I bet this thing's gonna run we might
see<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.110> smoke<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:27.320> think<00:01:28.320> it'll<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
see some smoke I think it'll be

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.620 
see some smoke I think it'll be
hilarious<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.960> fun<00:01:31.200> project

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.849 

and<00:01:36.630> before<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> injury<00:01:37.380> wouldn't<00:01:37.530> rotate

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
and before the injury wouldn't rotate

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.429 
and before the injury wouldn't rotate
all<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.219> because<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.840> rust<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.229> stop

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
all the way because the rust would stop

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:50.779 
all the way because the rust would stop
the<00:01:40.590> piston<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:47.039> now<00:01:47.219> it's<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:50.670> like

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
the piston but now it's good just like

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.130 
the piston but now it's good just like
new<00:01:51.060> right<00:01:53.689> all<00:01:54.689> right

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
new right all right

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630 
new right all right
oh<00:01:55.170> oh<00:01:55.469> also<00:01:55.709> while<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.310> doing<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
oh oh also while I was doing there I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.529 
oh oh also while I was doing there I
threw<00:01:56.819> a<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.179> oil<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.479> there

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
threw a little bit of oil in there

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.880 
threw a little bit of oil in there
because<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.049> old<00:01:58.170> pan<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.560> full<00:01:58.709> of<00:01:58.770> water

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
because the old pan was full of water

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.309 
because the old pan was full of water
also<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.209> I<00:02:00.270> threw<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.569> oil<00:02:00.750> through<00:02:00.929> that<00:02:01.079> up

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
also so I threw some oil through that up

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.600 
also so I threw some oil through that up
here<00:02:01.500> by<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> lifter<00:02:01.950> try<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.459> oil

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
here by the lifter try to get some oil

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
here by the lifter try to get some oil
down<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.209> or<00:02:03.630> something<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
down on the bottom or something on it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
down on the bottom or something on it
might<00:02:04.319> not<00:02:04.439> help<00:02:04.560> much<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> want<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.329> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
might not help much but I want it all in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.080 
might not help much but I want it all in
there<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.049> natural<00:02:07.319> right<00:02:07.759> as<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.910> put

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there it's just natural right as I put
