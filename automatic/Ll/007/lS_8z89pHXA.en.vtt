00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
understand how to cut extensions because

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.630 
understand how to cut extensions because
I<00:00:15.089> think<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.750> challenging<00:00:16.640> task

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I think it's really a challenging task

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640 
I think it's really a challenging task
if<00:00:17.910> something<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> you've<00:00:18.539> never<00:00:18.779> done<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
if something that you've never done the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
if something that you've never done the
most<00:00:19.830> important<00:00:20.310> thing<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> make

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
most important thing is you have to make

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.189 
most important thing is you have to make
sure<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> hair<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:21.810> prepped

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
sure that the hair is really prepped

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
sure that the hair is really prepped
after<00:00:22.529> you've<00:00:22.680> applied<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.220> extensions<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
after you've applied the extensions so

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.390 
after you've applied the extensions so
putting<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.840> slight<00:00:25.170> Bend<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> hair<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
putting a slight Bend of the hair of you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.679 
putting a slight Bend of the hair of you
know<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> hair<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.210> completely

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
know so the hair is not completely

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
know so the hair is not completely
pletely<00:00:28.140> bone<00:00:28.769> straight<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.429> makes<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
pletely bone straight just makes it a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
pletely bone straight just makes it a
lot<00:00:29.970> easier<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.480> move<00:00:30.720> through<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> hair<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
lot easier to move through the hair and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100 
lot easier to move through the hair and
always<00:00:32.040> cut<00:00:32.430> them<00:00:32.550> dry<00:00:32.790> never<00:00:33.239> cut<00:00:33.480> them<00:00:33.660> wet<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
straight razor without the guard so you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.770 
straight razor without the guard so you
have<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.809> careful<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:41.780> really

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
have to be really careful really really

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.040 
have to be really careful really really
steady<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.850> work<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
steady and what I do is I work with a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
steady and what I do is I work with a
combination<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.800> taking<00:00:47.190> weight<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.640> length

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
combination of taking weight in length

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.090 
combination of taking weight in length
and<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.110> working<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> last<00:00:49.860> two

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and I'm really working in the last two

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
and I'm really working in the last two
inches<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> hair<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.539> makes

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
inches of hair because that's what makes

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
inches of hair because that's what makes
this<00:00:51.930> look<00:00:52.170> natural<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.730> times

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this look natural a lot of the times

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
this look natural a lot of the times
extensions<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> look<00:00:54.960> very<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.350> blunt<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
extensions can look very very blunt and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.209 
extensions can look very very blunt and
thick<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.090> why<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> create

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
thick so why doing this you see I create

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.119 
thick so why doing this you see I create
softness<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> hair<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.530> my<00:01:01.530> guide<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
softness in the hair and my guide is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.060 
softness in the hair and my guide is
really<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.090> random<00:01:04.019> roving<00:01:04.799> guide

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really kind of a random roving guide

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
really kind of a random roving guide
it's<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.270> by<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.659> eye<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's really a lot by your eye so you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's really a lot by your eye so you
want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> constantly<00:01:08.430> work<00:01:08.970> through<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> hair

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
want to constantly work through the hair

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.560 
want to constantly work through the hair
take<00:01:10.500> small<00:01:10.860> sections<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:15.060> always<00:01:15.240> work

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
take small sections and I always work

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.800 
take small sections and I always work
from<00:01:15.900> corner<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> Center<00:01:16.860> corner<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.990> Center

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
from corner to Center corner to Center

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.090 
from corner to Center corner to Center
corner<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.799> Center<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:24.420> creates

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
corner to Center and that creates

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
corner to Center and that creates
movement<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.460> each<00:01:26.640> side<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> looks<00:01:27.479> really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
movement on each side so it looks really

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.399 
movement on each side so it looks really
natural<00:01:29.329> corner<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:32.520> Center<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
natural corner to Center and I use just

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
natural corner to Center and I use just
actually<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.430> tip<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> blade<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
actually the tip of the blade to the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.929 
actually the tip of the blade to the
middle<00:01:36.869> part<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> blade

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.870 

you<00:01:43.939> see<00:01:44.149> how<00:01:44.270> soft<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.689> is<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:46.640> other<00:01:46.759> thing

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you see how soft that is the other thing

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.870 
you see how soft that is the other thing
is<00:01:47.060> take<00:01:47.359> small<00:01:47.750> sections<00:01:48.100> don't<00:01:49.100> try<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.399> do

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
is take small sections don't try to do

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.109 
is take small sections don't try to do
really<00:01:50.450> large<00:01:50.780> thick<00:01:51.759> sections<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.000> to

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
really large thick sections you have to

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.789 
really large thick sections you have to
