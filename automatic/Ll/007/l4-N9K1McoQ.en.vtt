 the neck grabs him for a pitcher man 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 suplex bad boy is putting resistance 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.360
 but still receives the movement of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.240

 he grabbed his foot 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.860
 he lost his balance and could not and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.740
 there was now a bad boy tells him what 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.500
 hit but it's clogging all 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.860
 Captain's swipes I try to kick him 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.750
 but this one hunted him and threw him to the ground 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 they are still warming it still does not start 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.490
 the strong movements now is bad boy 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.550
 the one who tried to catch the captain but 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.320
 this one released the movement is still missing 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.600
 see how best these two have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.910
 athletes now it seems that they are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 trying to box bad boy throws a 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.070
 slap captain this one returns it for no 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.860
 it hits 'bad boys' this one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.590
 of the captain's attacks but he if he 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.690
 pega gave him three swipes if they carry 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.150
 several kicks and look at that kick that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.240
 he hit those flying kicks in the face 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.119
 they come out of nowhere and look is trying 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.700
 your key the sniper do not go to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.130
 seize the opportunity look like 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.410
 capital mexico was struggling 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.380
 wants to release and reaches down to 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.200
 guasavense bad boy takes his distance 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.500
 is fighting the capital tells him that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.600
 go on the bad boy is taking advantage 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 its height has greater reach and can 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.550
 keep the distance now if you take 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.160
 of the arms the captain hit him 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.180
 knees now takes bad boy from the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.580
 waist picks him up and throws him to the ground 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.890
 is that island should have affected the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.950
 Guasavense but go as if nothing and see 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.590
 this lack of respect still makes fun 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.500
 the chilango the red his bandana and what 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.959
 I hit in the back with a kick 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.180
 he threw in his famous marometas and now 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.230
 they are going to try again the body key 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.720
 to body 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.239
 bad boy is dominating it as far as 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.120
 key the captain tried to type it but 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.180
 he did not manage to knock down the bad guy they go back to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.489
 take they are protecting bad boy what 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.590
 He has gripped the neck apparently 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.500
 champion is being dominated by the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.230
 challenger bad boy throws him to the ground and 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.220
 takes its instance we can see that the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.829
 Champion is no longer with so much energy 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.470
 see a little reluctant but now if 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 it seems he wants to apply another fichman 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.049
 suplex but both are in a padlock 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.060
 none is dominating the champion 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.900
 ended up throwing something like that 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.760
 ground 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.590
 again take their budweiser instance 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.010
 first to attack takes by the neck 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.870
 captain and he makes a suplex count one 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.970
 nothing 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.069
 the champion will not allow to lose by 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.720
 I count so easily 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.989
 now the challenger is attacking with 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.750
 slaps the champion this one wants to get in 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.700
 inside the grip area of bad boy at 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.220
 end he achieves it and takes it in the legs 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.349
 but you can not lift it and it's 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.190
 putting resistance and finish 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.130
 interlaced 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.570
 a padlock on the ground bad boy seems 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.260
 you want to apply the key 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.350
 neck is reached to release we are 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.870
 seeing now the last of each one is 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.090
 note that they are losing energy the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 captain apparently wants to throw a bad 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.700
 boy and master it with those keys 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.860
 force reaches throwing it back 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.590
 but bad boy puts his hands and frees himself 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.440
 he attacks with his kicks of sea ​​or goal 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.050
 but the captain blocks again another 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.450
 key or 'bad boy' will take the leg and what 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.700
 throws to the ground the two fall here they 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.420
 try to see who will be the first to 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.890
 apply a submission key to the other 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.470
 we can see that bad boy continues with the 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.990
 teasing the captain rams but is 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.090
 blocked easily we see that it is 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.760
 very tired and the challenger shows 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.830
 quite confident wanted to attack him 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.410
 hug him in the back and continue with 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.420
 the key or 'bad boy' is shown with 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.170
 enough energy before the champion that already 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.030
 it is not seen so strongly now it is 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.370
 trying to hit him again but 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.740
 champion now blocks those attacks 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.600
 today is not putting much force to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.030
 those blows like he just wants 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.820
 distract attention and enter but see 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.520
 at the end I try to hug the captain and 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.560
 he took it from his head with a good 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.830
 padlock to the neck can affect quite 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.080
 the challenger see how he has her and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.990
 have to escape soon or you will have to 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.660
 surrender is hitting captain and you're 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.900
 He released did not have enough strength 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.500
 grab now bad boy is the one who takes in a 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.800
 neck lock to the champion has it 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.660
 well mastered this will have to surrender or 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.660
 be released very soon and he surrendered 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:53.199
 that's the winner of this fight and 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.199
 new champion league broadway 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.960

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.680
 seen in Mexico he gives the belt to 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.100
 guasave boy and this one raise it high 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.700
 they greet each other as good athletes and 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.700
 under him shows that he is now the champion 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.450
 captain mexico that feels like having 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.120
