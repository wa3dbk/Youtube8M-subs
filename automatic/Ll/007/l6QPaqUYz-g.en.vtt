too<00:02:11.200> much<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> problem<00:02:11.620> takes<00:02:11.920> three<00:02:12.220> triple

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
too much of a problem takes three triple

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550 
too much of a problem takes three triple
a<00:02:12.670> batteries<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.330> there's<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.870> notch<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.410> you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a batteries and there's a notch here you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.540 
a batteries and there's a notch here you
line<00:02:14.770> up<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.790> match<00:02:16.030> inside<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:16.990> and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
line up with the match inside here and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.440 
line up with the match inside here and
shouldn't<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> change<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> batteries

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
shouldn't have to change the batteries

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.090 
shouldn't have to change the batteries
hardly<00:02:19.750> ever<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.200> guess<00:02:20.440> depending<00:02:20.950> how<00:02:21.040> much

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
hardly ever I guess depending how much

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.790 
hardly ever I guess depending how much
you<00:02:21.310> use<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.670> obviously<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.590> batteries<00:02:23.590> last

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
you use it obviously but batteries last

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.560 
you use it obviously but batteries last
quite<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> while<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.760> have<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.360> worry<00:02:25.480> about

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
quite a while to have to worry about

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.210 
quite a while to have to worry about
that<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.080> gets<00:02:26.170> dimmer<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:26.950> Santa

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
that but if it gets dimmer it's Santa

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.560 
that but if it gets dimmer it's Santa
sounds<00:02:27.490> quiet<00:02:27.760> or<00:02:27.970> something<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.330> change

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
sounds quiet or something just change

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.590 
sounds quiet or something just change
the<00:02:28.660> batteries<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.110> you'll<00:02:29.230> be<00:02:29.320> good<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> go

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the batteries and you'll be good to go

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.310 
the batteries and you'll be good to go
