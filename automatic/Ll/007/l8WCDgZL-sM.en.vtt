she divided the section into two pieces
and<00:00:58.530> start<00:00:59.220> twisting<00:00:59.760> them<00:00:59.970> in<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.540> direction

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
and start twisting them in one direction

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.000 
and start twisting them in one direction
after<00:01:01.830> she<00:01:02.309> finished<00:01:02.670> twisting<00:01:03.229> she<00:01:04.229> move

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
after she finished twisting she move

around themselves in opposite direction

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.230 
around themselves in opposite direction
what<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.159> next<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.030> a

subsection from the right side of the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.319 
subsection from the right side of the
head<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> temples<00:01:22.229> calm<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> through<00:01:23.640> get

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a bit hold the spray and twist this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
a bit hold the spray and twist this
piece<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.369> our<00:01:30.150> rate<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> done<00:01:31.320> before

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
piece or our rate that we done before

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130

then<00:01:32.399> we<00:01:32.579> move<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> another<00:01:32.969> side<00:01:33.539> take

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then we move to another side take

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.010 
then we move to another side take
another<00:01:34.469> subsection<00:01:35.130> comb<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> through<00:01:36.119> we

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
another subsection comb it through we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
another subsection comb it through we
spray<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.829> take<00:01:38.579> all<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:38.969> flyaways

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
spray it with a take all the flyaways

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.669 
spray it with a take all the flyaways
and<00:01:40.310> again<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.969> top<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.390> our<00:01:42.509> braid<00:01:43.079> we

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
and again on the top of our braid we

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.529 
and again on the top of our braid we
start<00:01:44.219> twisting<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.999> put<00:01:48.270> one

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
start twisting so now we see we put one

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.639 
start twisting so now we see we put one
piece<00:01:49.530> from<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.899> rotate<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.109> in

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
piece from the right side rotate it in

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
piece from the right side rotate it in
one<00:01:52.859> direction<00:01:53.039> then<00:01:53.999> we<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.359> is<00:01:54.749> from

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
one direction then we take is from

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
one direction then we take is from
another<00:01:55.200> side<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> rotate<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.819> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
another side and rotate it in the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.959 
another side and rotate it in the
opposite<00:01:57.329> direction<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.280> continue

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
opposite direction so now we continue

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
opposite direction so now we continue
moving<00:02:00.179> down<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.319> hairline<00:02:01.829> take

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
moving down the hairline take

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.779 
moving down the hairline take
section-by-section<00:02:03.530> combing<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> hair

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
section-by-section combing the hair

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.510 
section-by-section combing the hair
spray<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:07.380> make<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> smooth<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> even

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
spray in it to make it smooth and even

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.380 
spray in it to make it smooth and even
and<00:02:09.000> again<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.679> turn<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.819> around

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and again we turn it around

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.990 
and again we turn it around
our<00:02:12.540> first<00:02:13.050> braid<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.670> move<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
our first braid and then we move the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.809 
our first braid and then we move the
hair<00:02:15.240> evenly<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.260> cover<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.220> missing

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
hair evenly to cover all the missing

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.449 
hair evenly to cover all the missing
parts<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.720> again<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.530> move<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.860> another<00:02:20.069> side

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
parts now again we move to another side

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.390 
parts now again we move to another side
again<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.690> tension<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.790> very<00:02:23.790> important<00:02:24.360> here

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
again the tension is very important here

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.500 
again the tension is very important here
keeping<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.700> together

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
keeping it all together

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.580 
keeping it all together
twisting<00:02:28.349> now<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:28.920> take<00:02:29.430> another<00:02:30.000> section

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
twisting now we take another section

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.089 
twisting now we take another section
spray<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.090> twist<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.270> around<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.560> central

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
spray it and twist it around the central

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.420 
spray it and twist it around the central
braid<00:02:35.310> take<00:02:36.210> all<00:02:36.480> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
braid take all the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.089

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
we have done so at the beginning we

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
we have done so at the beginning we
start<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> horseshoe<00:03:22.250> section<00:03:23.000> on<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
start with a horseshoe section on the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.259 
start with a horseshoe section on the
top<00:03:23.500> make<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:25.900> split<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.019> into<00:03:27.200> two<00:03:27.440> pieces

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
top make it to split it into two pieces

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.199 
top make it to split it into two pieces
braid<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.480> into<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.980> rope<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:31.849> take<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
braid it into the rope then we take the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.600 
braid it into the rope then we take the
section<00:03:32.599> from<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.989> right<00:03:33.170> side<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.890> spin<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
section from the right side and spin it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.470 
section from the right side and spin it
around<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:36.650> braid<00:03:37.010> then<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.880> take<00:03:38.060> section

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
around this braid then we take section

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.240 
around this braid then we take section
from<00:03:38.630> another<00:03:38.870> side<00:03:39.200> as<00:03:39.380> pin<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.739> into<00:03:40.040> another

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
from another side as pin it into another

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.449 
from another side as pin it into another
direction<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:41.690> step-by-step<00:03:42.680> moving<00:03:43.190> down

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
direction then step-by-step moving down

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.089 
direction then step-by-step moving down
we<00:03:43.760> take<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.480> left<00:03:44.690> side<00:03:45.019> right<00:03:45.049> side<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.829> spin

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
we take in left side right side and spin

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.069 
we take in left side right side and spin
it<00:03:46.220> in<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.519> opposite<00:03:46.880> direction<00:03:47.090> creating

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
it in the opposite direction creating

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.100
