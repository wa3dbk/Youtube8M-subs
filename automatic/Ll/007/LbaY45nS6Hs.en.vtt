of a slow down mid trick there now he
came<00:01:09.869> off<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.530> nicely<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.790> he

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
came off very nicely but I think he

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
came off very nicely but I think he
might<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.060> sucked<00:01:12.630> his<00:01:12.780> knees<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.560> the

might have sucked his knees up at the
wrong<00:01:13.890> time<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.610> happens<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> pull
