00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
these are from my ez harvester bins and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.340 
these are from my ez harvester bins and
I<00:00:13.400> haven't<00:00:14.400> I've<00:00:15.299> been<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> bit<00:00:15.750> lazy<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I haven't I've been a bit lazy and I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.930 
I haven't I've been a bit lazy and I
haven't<00:00:16.650> been<00:00:16.830> separating<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> daily

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
haven't been separating them on a daily

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.939 
haven't been separating them on a daily
basis<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> week's<00:00:19.410> worth<00:00:21.949> but

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
basis this is about a week's worth but

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.820 
basis this is about a week's worth but
I've<00:00:23.460> put<00:00:23.699> them<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.000> into<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.480> bucket<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.199> as

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I've put them all into one bucket and as

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
I've put them all into one bucket and as
you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.400> there's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> movement

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you can see there's a lot of movement

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
you can see there's a lot of movement
there<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.720> around<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> edges<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.619> no

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
there but around the edges there's no

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.240 
there but around the edges there's no
movement<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.910> tends<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> happen<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:31.250> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
movement what tends to happen is the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.240 
movement what tends to happen is the
they<00:00:32.790> group<00:00:33.030> together<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
they group together so all the good and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
they group together so all the good and
healthy<00:00:35.430> ones<00:00:35.790> would<00:00:36.649> group<00:00:37.649> together<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
healthy ones would group together and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340 
healthy ones would group together and
they<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.430> push<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.660> rubbish<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
they will push all the rubbish and the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220 
they will push all the rubbish and the
shells<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.309> they're<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.360> dead<00:00:42.570> ones<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
shells and they're the dead ones to the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.940 
shells and they're the dead ones to the
side<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.350> ones<00:00:46.590> over<00:00:46.770> here

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
side so these ones over here

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
side so these ones over here
they're<00:00:49.950> either<00:00:50.640> turning<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.539> pupae

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
they're either turning into pupae

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.819 
they're either turning into pupae
they're<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.100> moving<00:00:53.309> anymore<00:00:54.620> there's<00:00:55.620> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
they're not moving anymore there's one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
they're not moving anymore there's one
right<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.329> but<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> pupae

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
right there but that is the pupae

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.540 
right there but that is the pupae
actually<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> wants<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> touch<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.399> I'm

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
actually so that wants to touch but I'm

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually so that wants to touch but I'm
not<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> store<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> pupae<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.460> not

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
not going to store the pupae and I'm not

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
not going to store the pupae and I'm not
ready<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.630> anything<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.229> right

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to between 12 and 15 degrees and these

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:13.810 
to between 12 and 15 degrees and these
tend<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> last<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.880> months

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
get whatever they push to the top as
well<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.470> I'll<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.980> left<00:02:20.190> with

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
well and then I'll just be left with

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:30.440 
well and then I'll just be left with
these<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:28.020> way<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> count<00:02:28.650> them<00:02:29.209> if<00:02:30.209> you're

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
these the way I count them if you're

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.410 
these the way I count them if you're
curious<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.170> our<00:02:32.040> way<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:34.550> way<00:02:35.550> up<00:02:35.580> about<00:02:35.910> 50<00:02:36.390> of

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
curious is our way up way up about 50 of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.240 
curious is our way up way up about 50 of
them<00:02:37.370> divided<00:02:38.370> by<00:02:38.520> 50<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.470> when<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
them divided by 50 and then I can when I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.430 
them divided by 50 and then I can when I
weigh<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:42.150> divide<00:02:42.480> divided<00:02:43.290> by

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
weigh the lot just divide divided by

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.979 
weigh the lot just divide divided by
whatever<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:44.070> number<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.459> came<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.940> with<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
whatever a number I came up with so I

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.990 
whatever a number I came up with so I
don't<00:02:46.320> count<00:02:46.620> them<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.310> count<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:47.640> lot

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
don't count them I just count one lot

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.110 
don't count them I just count one lot
and<00:02:48.209> then<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.690> am<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.790> estimate<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.270> rest

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and then I am then I estimate the rest
