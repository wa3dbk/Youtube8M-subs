I'll open it up let's open it up it has
a<00:00:56.280> greater<00:00:56.850> resistance<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:58.940> corrosion<00:01:00.440> then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a greater resistance to corrosion then

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.620 
a greater resistance to corrosion then
this<00:01:01.649> GDP<00:01:02.579> 189<00:01:04.280> people<00:01:05.280> call<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> new

this GDP 189 people call it the new
super<00:01:07.140> steel<00:01:07.610> but<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:09.229> don't<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.710> haven't

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
super steel but i don't know i haven't

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.760 
super steel but i don't know i haven't
used<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:12.060> Newton<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
used this and I'm Newton to this kind of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.170 
used this and I'm Newton to this kind of
steel<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> I'll<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:16.970> they<00:01:17.970> only

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
steel so I'll just have to see they only

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
steel so I'll just have to see they only
made<00:01:19.490> 535<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.850> each<00:01:21.330> run<00:01:21.659> meaning<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.979> we

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
made 535 of each run meaning and then we

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.780 
made 535 of each run meaning and then we
made<00:01:23.479> 535<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> plain<00:01:25.350> edge<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> 5<00:01:26.070> 35<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
made 535 of the plain edge and 5 35 of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
made 535 of the plain edge and 5 35 of
the<00:01:27.439> combo<00:01:28.439> edge<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> serrations<00:01:30.560> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the combo edge with the serrations so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.100 
the combo edge with the serrations so
it's<00:01:31.770> limited<00:01:32.520> edition<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> composite

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it's limited edition so is the composite

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
blade but yeah and like you can see the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
blade but yeah and like you can see the
contrast<00:01:40.380> between<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.890> blade<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
contrast between the blade and the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
contrast between the blade and the
handle<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.049> blade<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:44.009> bit<00:01:44.189> darker

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

handle the blade is a little bit darker
than<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> handle<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.530> has<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.950> black

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
than the handle and all it has the black

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
than the handle and all it has the black

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.920

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
as close as I can see how thick it is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.980 
as close as I can see how thick it is
compared<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> other<00:04:11.270> one<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.840> there<00:04:14.840> go
