as you can see there's a little bit of
chrome<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:59.100> that's<00:02:59.250> front<00:02:59.519> just<00:02:59.700> from

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
chrome I think that's front just from

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.400 
chrome I think that's front just from
taking<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.630> off<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.989> after<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> while

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
now it does start to kind of get out of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.900 
now it does start to kind of get out of
whack<00:03:04.019> there<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.010> does<00:03:05.190> cover<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.670> chrome
