00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
is interesting in the proper response

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.410 
is interesting in the proper response
makes<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.350> very<00:01:45.630> very<00:01:46.710> snappy

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
makes it very very snappy

the<00:01:49.720> throttle<00:01:50.170> response<00:01:50.260> goes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the throttle response goes

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.890 
the throttle response goes
the<00:01:52.890> reason<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.340> making<00:01:53.430> video<00:01:54.000> part<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> the

the reason I'm making video part of the
reason<00:01:55.140> making<00:01:55.440> video<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:57.570> what

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
reason making video is because of what

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.280 
reason making video is because of what
it<00:01:57.990> does<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.920> car<00:01:59.370> as<00:02:00.210> far<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.960> power

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.190 
when
we<00:02:43.670> floor

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
we floor

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.370 
we floor
and<00:02:45.650> from<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> normal<00:02:46.370> driving<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:47.090> 2000<00:02:47.959> rpm

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and from a normal driving a 2000 rpm

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.600 
and from a normal driving a 2000 rpm
doing

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
doing

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.539 
doing
get<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> floor<00:02:51.480> watch<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.530> new<00:02:52.650> rpm<00:02:52.950> does

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.690 

so<00:03:00.549> yeah<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.299> -<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.569> what<00:03:01.840> 5500<00:03:02.680> RPM<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.430> we

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
so yeah what - like what 5500 RPM and we

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.430 
so yeah what - like what 5500 RPM and we
gained<00:03:04.140> five<00:03:05.140> miles<00:03:05.890> an<00:03:06.069> hour<00:03:06.159> maybe<00:03:07.409> almost

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.310 

so<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.490> gives<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.000> feeling<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.780> things

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
so it gives you the feeling that things

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.500 
so it gives you the feeling that things
are<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.800> faster<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.790> sounds<00:03:15.240> like<00:03:15.360> things

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
are going faster it sounds like things

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.910 
are going faster it sounds like things
are<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.840> faster

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
are going faster

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.809 
are going faster
but<00:03:17.400> they're<00:03:17.580> really<00:03:17.730> not

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.679 

but<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:23.769> your<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.370> sucks<00:03:24.640> very<00:03:25.060> very

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
but it's your kind of sucks very very

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.170 
but it's your kind of sucks very very
plain<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.200> mean<00:03:26.349> it's<00:03:26.499> taught<00:03:27.459> mentally<00:03:28.030> I'm

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
plain I mean it's taught mentally I'm

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.160 
plain I mean it's taught mentally I'm
comparing<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.840> to
