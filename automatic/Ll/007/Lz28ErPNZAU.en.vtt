00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.649
 I love her very much 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.170
 she passed through all my childhood 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.609
 and left in a little snow 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 starting with the post let me and this is chrome 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.600
 on achievement 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.630
 so what's the problem 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.690
 mercury moris mine 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.560
 sorry in the center of the plot regarding 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.440
 action process 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 continue please 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639
 the problem is not even in the game itself 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.639
 reviews on it and how it reacts 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.740
 such a conversion looked none of 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.360
 they do not catch the day after 3 days 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 pay without looking at 0 thousand games 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.720
 no, don't get me wrong it 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.370
 good graphics game but then yielded 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.460
 to my 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 there are no complaints 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 the problem is different 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.660
 this game it just did not know anthil 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.840
 if you hadn't said what the name is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 I would be here now 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.540
 did not sit 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290
 how about just a charter flight 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.970
 everything is so bad the composition was 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.920
 only 4 is related to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.689
 compatibility and more than we 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.359
 despite the fact that initially this 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.900
 a game 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.120
 no relation to this 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.820
 the universe did not have 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 fill in there for now please 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.720
 platini let's start with little things riddles 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.390
 before puzzles were bridges roads parietal 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.680
 intelligent interesting 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.600
 some even require knowledge 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.770
 Shakespeare spent years 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.670
 now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 covering nets here is this chayna town detail 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.100
 from Russia 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.460
 ready 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.590
 what a palace 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740
 how do you see yourself calmly 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.850
 and monsters 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.240
 show before and the monster is not only 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.489
 was the embodiment of fear itself 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.010
 but it was also a symbol that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.349
 what does it mean 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.099
 now it 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.589
 lava crab 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.849
 are you 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.279
 humanoid like men you are 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.589
 not even afraid 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.590
 and generally 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 three types of mon side and game 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.819
 which is no different except 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.409
 appearance 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.029
 it's just a quickie 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.209
 vadim train 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.350
 and what 1 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.320
 used to play 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.600
 all the time kept us suspense passions 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.950
 what why is there now a monster who can 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 condemn immediately not scary at all 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.129
 why 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.400
 but because we are practically the whole game 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.109
 are in absolute 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.649
 security 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.229
 what kind of horror movie is 85 percent and 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.609
 nothing threatens our lives 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.479
 we walk in a deserted city all 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.959
 until ice appears 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.479
 we can calmly dance tectonics 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.559
 Kiev in this part of the monsters have to run away 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.149
 like real life 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.379
 you play females we have the most difficult 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.069
 difficulties and i will look at you like you 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.619
 will not surprise 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.619
 scary it's not when runaway 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.840
 scary near the door which stands 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.949
 you need to go 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.589
 and you can't carelessly him 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:32.859
 push off 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.129
 what is a bag of potatoes 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.950
 scary when you have the ultimate ammo for 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.579
 first aid kit that you save on your 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.869
 course dynamics 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.859
 and so the political alignment 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.629
 waste and no auto regeneration worse 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.549
 and from the federation texts that a ban 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.019
 that it is still stored at any point on the map 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.739
 by the way here the developers gave 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.269
 possibility of saving explosion 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.659
 at almost any moment two 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.269
 probably kidding 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.899
 further the atmosphere of the game 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.939
 earlier it was glad to meet with anyone 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.579
 man because next to him I feel 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.930
 yourself safety 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.020
 it's like watching a movie in a company 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.099
 one is a completely different experience 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.289
 decreased 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:19.309
 this is not why km yes because as I have 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.449
 spoke we feel absolutely 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.979
 security most of the game 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.199
 Day while we meet almost for 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.460
 every corner 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.430
 it becomes just boring astahov 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.969
 not at all yet 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.240
 compare can send 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.389
 her daughter's rescue from the sector here is not even 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.080
 with words required 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.960
 to describe which way I bow 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.180
 but the main reason 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.029
 this outflow frightens us 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.749
 he himself requested this staircase supposedly 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.569
 the company 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.120
 We need 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.009
 insecure 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.309
 fearfully 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:00.539
 Marmaris chats more modern 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.349
 remake of a nightmare on elm street this 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.550
 solid about 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.430
 it's not scary it's just a joke 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.750
 more annoying how difficult it is 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.090
 they are also missing the countdown 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.270
 only on 53 2 1 preparation for october 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.520
 Hozh Ahmad Khan but agree purely 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.669
 atmospheric 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.219
 the walls are covered and incomprehensible the most 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.529
 bloody at the next station much 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.229
 worse when 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.389
 Yes, and in general, the local uniform is frightening 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.219
 beauty we do not have time to enjoy 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.360
 because it occurs only in those 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.089
 places where we are the messenger of the monster is all on 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.580
 what we pay attention then 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.639
 glowing door family 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.099
 and indeed all this scamps 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.629
 creepy take action and temporary tass 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.830
 but as I said, this does not mean that 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.180
 the game 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.800
 not worth playing it is really worth 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.400
 to let her know 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.729
 opinion that it is interesting to play but still 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.120
 it is interesting to watch plus everything 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.870
 a couple of puzzles that are still 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.490
 It is interesting to solve for example the one in which 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.370
 landlord car under water she 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.870
 really passes the whole sport 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.259
 horror is undeniable 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.279
 however worth noting 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.279
 but I still can not understand 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.599
 why am I the first to decide 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.069
 why such high prices 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.509
 For information counts country 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.110
 box sides 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.689
 but nothing, I will show the scheme and strength 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.269
 and how are you going to this 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:31.719
 to make 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.719
 in order to come up with 1 way 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.199
 nice roasting on your face 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.710
 feel better 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.210
 for thanks 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.849
 doctor 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.430
 on our website 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.830
 I have a photo for you 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.089
 30 days 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:52.020
 but what 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.020
 let's play a melody suffocating azarov at last 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.119
 if to carry out how 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.489
 and the very first part of this series is possible 

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:09.619
 say that thoroughly the police are very similar 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:12.399
 on the original 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:15.150
 certain stronger side 3 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
 is the atmosphere 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:21.919
 for the game of the series I do not like it 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.919
 According to the main difference from taxes 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:27.930
 August 1 of this year 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.930
 greatest interest to this person 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.949
 which now help they get in the way 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.419
 as the air force transmits something similar to 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.419
 platform 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:44.279
 also not worth playing not only pretty 

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.300
 strong growth of 17 7 7 million 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.919
 in any case, the new part of the series will be 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.430
 leave him many but the impressions that 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.230
 for sure will remain in our memory of manats
