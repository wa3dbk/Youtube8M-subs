00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:15.529
 ok so that's going these studies and I'm 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.770
 with the moment when the file 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.230
 he looks at me and so here we go 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 comment on a small part but we are going 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 make a special concept from elsewhere 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 it's not better that I turn the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 production in fact brief here we go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 do a little special concept since 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.930
 we'll comment on the part yeah 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 but that's fine I think because we 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.860
 see we see that his point of view I 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 want to put his camera but it's okay 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.829
 skip all the after costs have 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.090
 anyway and that's at least we know 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 exactly what does in all 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.270
 stuff so let's do we'll do 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.039
 two tests so we'll do this test 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 then it's true that for you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.600
 people that may be giving you trouble at the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.879
 head 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.550
 because it's going to be fast so we're 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.949
 in view of dimaga so it's of the pie 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 jms of dimaga is so it's a match of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.939
 Thursday an ionic speed so that's 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 dimaga of the team mtu and against brother 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 of the pink team crisis and here it is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 went on we'll see exactly what 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
 that they did it's the only thing that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 really annoy me is that it's not okay 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.229
 what's in the larvae actually 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 that's the only thing that bothers me 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 but hey ok maybe we can comment 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.210
 like that and in fact we're good we're going 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.740
 comment in his point of view even though 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 it's going all the screen is going to jump a little 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 because we follow the dimaga camera so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.780
 it allows you to see how fast 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.740
 does the screen move dimaga which is 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.689
 one of the coolest players of the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.020
 starcraft scene 2 either we saw it at the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.630
 sw it's frankly he's all smiles 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 all the time all nice all at last 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.290
 it's a cream what really if you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.229
 have the opportunity to meet him you 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.580
 who did he made a hen there? 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.980
 dimaga he has a bo 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.990
 in Seoul that's why that's it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.790
 gives mater sq but to be honest 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 each player in fact he will click 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.940
 everywhere because he wants to see everything 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.260
 which is important so we will test the the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.560
 drag is that it will give you trouble in 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.510
 the head 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 yeah but we honestly tell us 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.440
 in the comments here if you find 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.940
 that really get into his point 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.890
 it's too much gerba tiff 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 it's a word that exists and for us to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 can say it and in which case we will change 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.460
 and we change through a little bit he left 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
 on 15 hen 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.850
 he has a bo that is a bit peculiar 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.950
 since he does 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.810
 he often takes his gas very early 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.840
 to have a feeling very early is a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.490
 bo that only he use but there 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.740
 defends base of zerglings speedling 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.760
 baneling and then bening drop as a rule 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.080
 general is so we will get put 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.460
 in the dimaga head so says despite 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.870
 simply he sees we see well and 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.860
 judged bram with his overlord 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.240
 he should see me what's going on 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.860
 what is the voice that is 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.350
 not forgex hang or just ben 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.730
 ali it is that there is no forge 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.800
 so there is not the same bo that we 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.600
 done usually and bonce is weird and 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.760
 london so in fact he knows there has been 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.380
 a gates in the base here he sees the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.510
 pilot that's a bo that the protos 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.480
 use if there is a gates in the base 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.300
 the gate in principle will come out a two or 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.010
 three zealot chrono boost and to come 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.920
 to annoy a little the zerg is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.380
 behind nexus and it's a bo the passage 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.270
 that's a bo that you can punish if 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 you take an early gas zerg but 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.320
 really trailer bed and that you do 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.000
 a speedlings and mass speedlings you 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.630
 can punish this bo but I do it from 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.740
 now and then so here it comes 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.240
 scouts and they see that the gaillette and 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.440
 chrono boost and and besides they see 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.900
 that contrary to what I said 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.210
 it was there gas take behind and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.950
 there was a stalker 2 created so there is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.410
 a very fast gas a sudden blow a nexus 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.880
 much later so having it niger 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.290
 and frankly he plays on the microphone he 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
 play on the mapping 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.890
 so he just saw ok so 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.540
 it's an expanding quest with cyber so 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.130
 I just did my queen 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.510
 logical since I'm in pain what will happen 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.980
 finish so here and there now he 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.040
 thought gas super early as you have 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.600
 said then that usually bah voila voila 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.210
 how do we sometimes counter the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.950
 look for expand because always and he 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.000
 can have a kind of five text guy 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.950
 worried aggressive 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.420
 so he's doing costs iii queen i think 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.490
 that he may be a 4th and plays 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.160
 really defensive and they 're not going to b3 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.660
 he is 3 queen hockey 3 queen is his 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.540
 way to hold that kind of aggression 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.530
 it's not stupid once I see a proto 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.340
 defend yourself like that be careful to the east 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.590
 the gas intake 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.110
 queens who attack this loincloth 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.620
 to play really safe he knows that in 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.810
 face 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.060
 yeah but that's a chelou he knows that 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.070
 face there was face b 2 and he did not go 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.200
 look for his b3 he will look for teke 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.130
 very quickly so what is he going on 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.710
 Teke on something that requires case 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.140
 of either 1.2 base infestors or 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 basic muta what is it most likely 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.040
 so what's good is that here it is 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.080
 it's 3 for 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.120
 3 to queen so he makes it a full in 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.980
 each in his cache and another for 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.030
 move forward with the crip the English has everything 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.740
 simply they see the watch that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.570
 are positioned in front so who knows 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.650
 that there is already 3 minimum waits evokes this 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.820
 is not a forge in front of the stage 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.320
 I see it's not a forge 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.910
 important detail it is it's a detail 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560
 very important because if voice the 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.110
 forge down he's not going to be attacked 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.430
 immediately yes and so he sees it from 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.230
 get more now without a forge it's 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.370
 that there may be an aggression so he 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.530
 must be careful and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.070
 years Speedling it in one Speedling 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.810
 at that moment it's saanga if he 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.400
 had planned to leave on mute ac1 muta 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.230
 in less but as he feels that there is a 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.180
 aggression that is possible in front of it in 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.320
 either this feeling we have two rooms 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.420
 of evolution that are launched so 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.490
 probably dimaga will go on 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.170
 zerglings infestants I say well 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.710
 probably everything is zergling baneling 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.090
 of europe 1 on the dow is maybe 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.800
 zerglings bening europe 1 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.570
 and that it makes me super happy they 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.250
 see the prob aggression discuss at 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.510
 the winged rsa was seen had come ice 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.150
 a sense gates 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.710
 the c1 is 1.5 g gueye I think y mas 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.360
 not a diversion and said he was thin 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.860
 it's kind of 5 is aggressive at 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.510
 empty that I ask spain but that a 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.340
 have already been there he was seen too 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.540
 too late he could not see it and the 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.580
 this is the aggression that is good to happen 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.860
 it's a kind of adel irak the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.690
 defector aulas the CDU he missed 30 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.240
 on Spain it's super serious 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.190
 these critics the first defector on 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.870
 Spain and there it costs him super expensive 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.940
 go go go go their hip hop 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.800
 very pious zinc behind and there the 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.660
 proto which is completely all in and 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.630
 I'm afraid dimaga can not hold 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.130
 this push this game was very fast the 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.630
 that's what happened dimaga 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.860
 and d and at the beginning had a beard I was 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.870
 pygmies problem is that following it 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.390
 had nothing he did not see the 5 happened 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.020
 and it happens so early that you have it 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.550
 not seen from afar 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.750
 you are surprised spain are 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.700
 not or could not be finished and there they 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.170
 try to manage the maximum microphone but 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.250
 he can not do anything he was going 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.110
 surely the most in attack they 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.250
 call the +1 defense pretty quickly 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.800
 and now, at this touching one of 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.870
 costs and here they are hard enough for 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.870
 dimaga the pot here and 7 joe of the apce 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.770
 here it was fast and that's the 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.569
 small mistake in quotation marks is that 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.309
 he could not see he could not 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.689
 see some worry because if 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.830
 you see worries low finish what 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.749
 is important is to ask quickly 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.610
 of Spain and was preparing this attack 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.039
 he saw too late we saw him on his own 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.380
 and the sq is already in front of your house 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:52.229
 it's a bit finite what because actually 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.060
 he could have defended with just this 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.270
 kind 3 spy mass ling and three shots 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.680
 safe 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.180
 he could have defended this kind 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.259
 of aggression what and especially if behind 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.449
 must realize that if 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.430
 behind dimaga he was in the process of 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.509
 defend and start you the most 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.789
 zerglings attack and the most in 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.440
 zerglings defense and that he was shooting 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.569
 after that it's zerglings 2 2 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.479
 yesterday's game he could have some 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.830

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.539

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.310
 technology what and your the harling of 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.280

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.320

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.460
