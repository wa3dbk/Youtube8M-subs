00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello ask I hope you go 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.260
 well then I find you today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 to make a little frog in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.610
 paper for your children that's me my 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 little bit loves to play with since that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.060
 facts day so I'm going to show you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.590
 how to realize them right away 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 you need a big leaf or a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.050
 half big leaves 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.789
 I take a half because I 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 prefers to make smooth brown peaks 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:37.430
 find this line have so I'm going 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 cut my leaf in half like this 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.820
 so once you have the sheet 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.780
 your desired size 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.780
 we go first here I leaned in god 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.480
 that's as if we are going to plow and we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 will come here led to the center 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.909
 this part here here like this 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.909
 hop 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.100
 and this part there is also led 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.100
 possible 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 this is like a little boat here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.830
 we're going to actually cut out all this 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 low part that we use for nothing 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.840
 either with scissors or I'm going 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.159
 the end of term so we notice 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.159
 well the trait and then we just cut 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.549
 the part 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 once you have to listen to the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.650
 bar part or and opens and gets in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.729
 makes two squares on each side we have 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.610
 so marked continues to mark lepi here 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:06.360
 we're going to redo something that goes to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:11.000
 inside like this and then we're going 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.000
 do the same thing with the other square 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.390
 like this then we looted all the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.390
 rectangle 1 2 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:34.860
 wolson is then a bit east coast that 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.950
 does it's like banking and then we go 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.290
 pray again the last rank that for 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.290
 so mark if bankruptcy and who 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.930
 here is a good return 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:00.920
 and we're going to bring here to the center the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.920
 two girls like these closed up 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.920
 here we get a first triangle on 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.390
 will do the same on this side 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.439
 includes the prices we have here and we will 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.439
 well that in the center 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.530
 and here we get so a quarter is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.010
 so once you've got this 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.640
 square there we'll come here back up seven 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.300
 points there to fold here here and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.150
 this one seems alarming there we get 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.980
 so a first square and a smaller 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.410
 on top 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.080
 then we will come here to put the little one 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.370
 triangle that is there on the side and in 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.970
 below there is another we will do 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.030
 the same thing 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.400
 here and we will take this point there 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.130
 and we're going to come ramie here to the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.480
 center and well mark the fold we are going 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.760
 put all the triangles back on the other 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.670
 side so that agreed m and this one 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.010
 did the same thing with those there hop 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.410
 and there is also refuge on the other side 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.700
 pick up the point here and brought it back 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.890
 towards the center here we get this 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.930
 when world is cooked it starts to 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.700
 to rain 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 Then we will come to form the legs 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.310
 will first pray here downstairs to make 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.500
 a second 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.100
 carrez so we folded like these and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:47.860
 have taken again once more 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.740
 what we get next 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.780
 we will fold like this to make 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.780
 feat 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.780
 here 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.970
 same thing on the other side 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:19.290
 that's the front legs 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:24.240
 we are going to take the tip here and 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.400
 fold like these have done the same 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.960
 thing with this one so in fact one 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.770
 just put that part there on that 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:37.500
 once you've done this we've 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.100
 folded here the little triangle that remains 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.040
 at the end there inwards 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:48.060
 that's like this and then we go 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.910
 bend the back part of the body or who 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.020
 starts at the start of the hind legs on 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:01.020
 will bend 1,2 like this and then we'll 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:04.860
 come back bend here at the back so pretty 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.420
 close to half like this you 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.580
 go back and here you have your 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.520
 little frog so here is once 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.320
 you did your subsidiary up small 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.940
 bonus is wankers the mine and some 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.470
 good enough violent here you have more 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.730
 there the little frog is over 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.320
 you just have to draw some 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.810
 little eyes like I did on this one 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.730
 and then give it to your kids so 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.650
