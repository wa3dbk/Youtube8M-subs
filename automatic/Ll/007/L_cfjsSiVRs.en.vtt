00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
to make it just stay like that because

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700 
to make it just stay like that because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
as she might have some spins this is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.810 
as she might have some spins this is

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
like a six month old one but still spins

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.509 
like a six month old one but still spins
they<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> new<00:00:24.380> toy<00:00:25.380> plastic<00:00:25.920> belt<00:00:26.340> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
at all which I think that's kind of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.810 
at all which I think that's kind of
stupid<00:00:30.410> but<00:00:31.410> here's<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> stay

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
stupid but here's how to make it stay

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
stupid but here's how to make it stay
like<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.710> move<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
like this but you kind of still move it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
like this but you kind of still move it
around<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.430> make<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.090> stay<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:37.079> been

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
