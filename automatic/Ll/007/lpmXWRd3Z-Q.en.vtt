00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
that I'm putting in there but I've got

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.719 
that I'm putting in there but I've got
my<00:05:08.660> date<00:05:08.720> I've<00:05:09.500> got<00:05:09.680> my<00:05:09.770> almonds<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.280> oats<00:05:10.490> in

my date I've got my almonds and oats in

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.719 
my date I've got my almonds and oats in
the<00:05:10.820> thing<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.919> then<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:12.949> put<00:05:13.190> vanilla<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.639> it

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
the thing and then I put vanilla in it

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.170 
the thing and then I put vanilla in it

too

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.909 
too
but<00:05:14.450> that's<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.810> my<00:05:15.020> main<00:05:15.229> concern<00:05:15.470> right<00:05:15.860> now

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
but that's it my main concern right now

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.290 
but that's it my main concern right now
is<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.280> thing<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.789> held<00:05:17.060> everything

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
is the thing that held everything

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.550 
is the thing that held everything
together<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.780> last<00:05:17.930> time<00:05:18.110> was<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.320> chocolate

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
together the last time was the chocolate

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.560 
together the last time was the chocolate
chips<00:05:19.010> because<00:05:19.490> they<00:05:19.610> melted<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.270> then<00:05:20.419> put

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
chips because they melted and then put

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.150 
chips because they melted and then put
it<00:05:20.660> there<00:05:20.750> frigerator<00:05:21.110> they<00:05:21.260> solidify<00:05:21.650> again

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
it there frigerator they solidify again

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040 
it there frigerator they solidify again
and<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:22.310> would<00:05:22.370> tie<00:05:22.610> everything<00:05:22.850> together<00:05:23.050> I'm

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
and I would tie everything together I'm

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.210 
and I would tie everything together I'm
not<00:05:24.229> putting<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.500> chocolate<00:05:24.770> chips<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.070> there

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
not putting the chocolate chips in there

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.940 
not putting the chocolate chips in there
so<00:05:25.460> hopefully<00:05:25.760> I<00:05:26.479> can<00:05:27.110> let<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> run<00:05:27.680> long

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
so hopefully I can let it run long

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.350 
so hopefully I can let it run long
enough<00:05:27.979> that<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> oils<00:05:28.820> have<00:05:28.970> come<00:05:29.150> out<00:05:29.270> of

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
enough that the oils have come out of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.300 
enough that the oils have come out of
the<00:05:29.419> almonds<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:29.900> kind<00:05:30.139> of<00:05:30.260> like<00:05:30.979> trying<00:05:31.220> to

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
the almonds and kind of like trying to

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.129 
the almonds and kind of like trying to
solidify<00:05:31.610> everything<00:05:32.150> together<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.720> looks

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
solidify everything together that looks

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.050 
solidify everything together that looks
