00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends are online again small 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.120
 garden house 32 row cross circle of the Russian Federation and me 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 Dmitry of mountains 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 today after several releases 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 who were dedicated 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 modern basketball sneakers 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 come back hard to our beloved old 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.730
 good old school start with sneakers with 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 so really not afraid of this word difficult 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 name nike zoom 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 georgette 97 sneakers that were 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.420
 designed specifically for training 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 American football players are not boots 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.270
 who are traditional these guys are playing 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 on their soles it is clear that this is very and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.040
 very serious sneakers the fact is that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.170
 This model is most associated with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.610
 such a famous player in american 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 football like brett farv all the time confusing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 surname Fabry write in English 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.820
 but in Russian read headlights therefore 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.090
 remember this little lesson 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 Vocabulary began his career in 1991 in 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.539
 professional football team atlanta 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.479
 fields 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.000
 and then 90 second year went into such 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.540
 team like green bay packers where played 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 until 2007 then he changed three more 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
 teams and in 2010 already came out on 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.909
 retired but still it is 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.460
 probably one of the most titled 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.409
 american football players 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.619
 The fact is that in almost all of their 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.210
 boy he went out in the starting lineup 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.210
 quarterback very serious 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.310
 achievement so she didn't mean to him 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.890
 owns a huge number of records 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.810
 in this sport and one for me 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.570
 seemed probably the most interesting and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.470
 this is the only starting quarterback 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.110
 which you beat them all 32 teams 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.240
 and fail and that's it with him 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.180
 associate these sneakers precisely he 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.100
 participated in their advertising is already well understood 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.200
 it is immediately apparent that these are very powerful 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.780
 sneakers for such a powerful sport 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.570
 like american football as a rule 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 when the new color comes out right away 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 start thinking what team is she 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.000
 is well-defined 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.830
 relationship no description but 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.989
 I think that is closest to San Francisco 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.810
 fort on and us too so famous 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.239

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.560

 oregon dax is the university of oregon their 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.110
 university football forties 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.680
 after an oral agreement between the ox 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.390
 disney and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 the coach of this team and the official 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.310
 scott official symbol 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.440
 ducks from oregon became donald duck and by 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.590
 this day it remains therefore if suddenly 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.660

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.330

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.430
 these sneakers as i say they 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.260
 Of course on the fan to me immediately 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.460
 I liked the fact that they are very 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.830
 very powerful 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.860
 and memorable nontrivial effect 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.690
 and so love sneakers love something 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.550
 unusual stands in a circle 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.020

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.110

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.240
 this is such a seal behind 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.370
