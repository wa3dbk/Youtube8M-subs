in any spot in the edges just pretty
much<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> said<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> put<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> iron<00:00:48.719> blocks

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
much where I said to put the iron blocks

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
much where I said to put the iron blocks
temporarily<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.300> you

can place thought the spruce wood slabs
upside<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:53.760> cuz<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.930> Chase<00:00:55.230> still<00:00:55.500> hasn't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
on to the next step what is a ah then

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.800 
on to the next step what is a ah then
you're<00:01:29.610> gonna<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.939> us<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.329> stone<00:01:30.570> slabs

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you're gonna take us with stone slabs

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.789 
you're gonna take us with stone slabs
you're<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.140> place<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> upper

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you're gonna place them on the upper

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
you're gonna place them on the upper
half<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> block<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.780> just

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
half of the block here and this just

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.539 
half of the block here and this just
makes<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> look<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> lot<00:01:34.680> nicer<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> wheels

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
makes it look a lot nicer for the wheels

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
makes it look a lot nicer for the wheels
because<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.689> wheels<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> look<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> little

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
because the wheels just look a little

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.690 
because the wheels just look a little
weird<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:37.950> they're<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.280> sitting<00:01:38.579> out

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
weird when they're just sitting out

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
weird when they're just sitting out
there<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:39.810> food

just<00:01:42.869> overall<00:01:43.200> looks<00:01:43.409> nicer<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
just overall looks nicer I think it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.620 
just overall looks nicer I think it
looks<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.700> nicer<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.210> hopefully<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> guys

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
looks a lot nicer so hopefully you guys

looks a lot nicer so hopefully you guys
think<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.930> looks<00:01:46.079> nice<00:01:46.310> next<00:01:47.310> you're<00:01:47.549> gonna

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
think it looks nice next you're gonna

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.450 
think it looks nice next you're gonna
build<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
build up the like the back here and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
build up the like the back here and
you're<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> build<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.540> over<00:01:51.720> all

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you're just going to build up over all

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.740 
you're just going to build up over all
the<00:01:52.170> rest<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.939> like<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.270> truck<00:01:54.540> design

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the rest of the like the truck design

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
the rest of the like the truck design
which<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> easiest<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
which is a it's not the easiest to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.130 
which is a it's not the easiest to
explain<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:57.930> where<00:01:58.079> I'm

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
explain but you can get to see where I'm

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
explain but you can get to see where I'm
placing<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> blocks<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
placing the blocks and just kind of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
placing the blocks and just kind of
place<00:01:59.969> them<00:02:00.180> accordingly<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.200> gonna

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
place them accordingly so it's gonna

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.069 
place them accordingly so it's gonna
look<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.890> then<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:03.600> build<00:02:03.810> another

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
look like that then gonna build another

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
look like that then gonna build another
layer<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.409> top<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.790> leave<00:02:06.060> like

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
layer on top but you're gonna leave like

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
layer on top but you're gonna leave like
the<00:02:06.420> edge<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the edge there like you're not going to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.999 
the edge there like you're not going to
fill<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.920> part<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.640> connect<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.750> here

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
fill that part in your connect over here

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.820 
fill that part in your connect over here
this<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.250> makes<00:02:11.580> sense<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.120> my<00:02:12.150> head<00:02:12.270> so
