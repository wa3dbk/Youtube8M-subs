00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
like well this is what I do anyway

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.880 
like well this is what I do anyway
because<00:04:32.010> I've<00:04:32.310> noticed<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:32.820> these<00:04:33.890> this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
because I've noticed with these this

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.490

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
corners tend to stick up and they get

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.409 
corners tend to stick up and they get
caught<00:04:39.480> on<00:04:39.510> stuff<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.640> then<00:04:41.640> they<00:04:41.760> tear<00:04:42.240> off

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
caught on stuff and then they tear off

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.060 
caught on stuff and then they tear off
of<00:04:42.600> your<00:04:42.750> nail<00:04:42.930> design<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:43.770> makes<00:04:43.950> it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
of your nail design and it just makes it

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.690 
of your nail design and it just makes it

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
nail polish and that will prevent it

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.770 
nail polish and that will prevent it
