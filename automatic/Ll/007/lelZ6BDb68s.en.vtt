00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.720 

begin<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.820> repeat<00:00:54.210> by<00:00:54.750> knitting<00:00:55.730> but

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
begin your repeat by knitting but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
begin your repeat by knitting but
wrapping<00:00:57.210> twice<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.789> knit<00:01:03.390> wrapping<00:01:04.080> three

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
wrapping twice then knit wrapping three

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.210 
wrapping twice then knit wrapping three
times

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.780 

and<00:01:12.850> we'll<00:01:12.970> do<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.150> twice<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:15.430> wrapping

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and we'll do that twice so I'm wrapping

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.540 
and we'll do that twice so I'm wrapping
three<00:01:16.270> times<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:24.130> we'll<00:01:24.280> knit

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
three times again then we'll knit

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:42.090 
three times again then we'll knit
wrapping<00:01:24.910> twice<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.500> knit<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:40.920> repeat<00:01:41.920> this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
wrapping twice and knit to repeat this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.430 
wrapping twice and knit to repeat this
to<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> end<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.630> row<00:01:47.640> row<00:01:48.640> two<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:50.200> this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
to the end of the row row two now this

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.410 
to the end of the row row two now this
row<00:01:50.620> we're<00:01:50.800> just<00:01:50.950> going<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.220> knit<00:01:51.550> but<00:01:52.240> we'll

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
row we're just going to knit but we'll

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.690 
row we're just going to knit but we'll
drop<00:01:52.810> all<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.650> extra<00:01:54.130> loops<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.550> we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
drop all of the extra loops that we

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080 
drop all of the extra loops that we
wrapped<00:01:54.940> around<00:01:55.120> in<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.600> previous<00:01:56.050> row<00:01:57.090> so

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
wrapped around in the previous row so

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.280 
wrapped around in the previous row so
here<00:01:58.450> I'll<00:01:58.570> just<00:01:58.600> knit<00:02:03.660> so<00:02:04.660> here<00:02:04.900> I've<00:02:05.020> got<00:02:05.050> an

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
here I'll just knit so here I've got an

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.100 
here I'll just knit so here I've got an
extra<00:02:05.650> loop<00:02:05.800> I'll<00:02:06.010> just<00:02:06.250> drop<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.610> off<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:07.870> if

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
extra loop I'll just drop that off as if

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.900 
extra loop I'll just drop that off as if
it's<00:02:08.229> one<00:02:08.410> stitch<00:02:08.740> here<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.369> I've<00:02:09.520> got<00:02:09.700> two

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
it's one stitch here so I've got two

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's one stitch here so I've got two
extra<00:02:10.300> loops<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.810> one<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.970> drop<00:02:13.180> those

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
extra loops on this one just drop those

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.110 
extra loops on this one just drop those
off<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:15.160> it'll<00:02:15.370> look<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.580> little<00:02:15.790> bit<00:02:15.910> funky

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
off and it'll look a little bit funky

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
off and it'll look a little bit funky
until<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:16.690> get<00:02:18.390> finished<00:02:19.390> here<00:02:21.060> she's<00:02:22.060> gotten

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
until we get finished here she's gotten

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:38.770 
until we get finished here she's gotten
a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.660> extra<00:02:23.080> yarn<00:02:23.110> hanging<00:02:23.620> out<00:02:23.830> now

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.970 

so<00:02:39.780> what<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.200> doing<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.740> actually

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
so what this is doing is actually

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.840 
so what this is doing is actually
creating<00:02:42.140> shorter<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.380> longer<00:02:43.740> stitches<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
creating shorter and longer stitches the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.570 
creating shorter and longer stitches the
longer<00:02:45.800> stitches<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> ones<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.370> wrapped

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
longer stitches are the ones we wrapped

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.220 
longer stitches are the ones we wrapped
three<00:02:48.030> times<00:02:48.530> shorter<00:02:50.600> two<00:02:51.600> times<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.140> then

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
three times shorter two times and then

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
three times shorter two times and then
the<00:02:52.290> shortest<00:02:52.710> ones<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> ones<00:02:53.550> we

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the shortest ones are just the ones we

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.450 
the shortest ones are just the ones we
regularly<00:02:54.180> knit<00:02:57.260> row<00:02:58.260> three<00:02:58.530> we're<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
regularly knit row three we're going to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.420 
regularly knit row three we're going to
begin<00:02:59.580> by<00:03:00.590> knitting<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.070> wrapping

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
begin by knitting and then wrapping

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.170 
begin by knitting and then wrapping
three<00:03:02.820> times<00:03:03.120> two<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.350> three<00:03:07.760> knit<00:03:08.760> wrapping

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
three times two and three knit wrapping

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:23.690 
three times two and three knit wrapping
twice<00:03:15.020> knit<00:03:16.020> two

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.960 

and<00:03:24.700> then<00:03:25.000> knit<00:03:25.690> rapping<00:03:26.170> twice<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.850> then

and then knit rapping twice so then

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and then knit rapping twice so then
we'll<00:03:31.120> begin<00:03:31.210> our<00:03:31.720> repeat<00:03:32.500> by<00:03:32.770> knitting<00:03:33.990> and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
we'll begin our repeat by knitting and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.830 
we'll begin our repeat by knitting and
rapping<00:03:35.350> three<00:03:36.130> times<00:03:36.430> two<00:03:37.830> three<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.720> will<00:03:40.720> do

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.090 
knit one row four we're going to do the
same<00:04:43.389> thing<00:04:43.660> we<00:04:43.750> did<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.440> second<00:04:44.979> row

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
same thing we did for the second row

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.500 
same thing we did for the second row
we'll<00:04:45.430> just<00:04:45.729> knit<00:04:46.210> all<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:47.200> stitches<00:04:47.500> and
