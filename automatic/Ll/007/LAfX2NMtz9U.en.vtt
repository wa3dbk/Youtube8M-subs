00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.920
 suffered without straighteners can what you 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.560
 you have to wash your hair and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.260
 of course comb through from the bottom up 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 above because otherwise done book the knowledge 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.490
 we all 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.590
 And yes, if you are hobby going on you can 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 Of course, no matter how do I what 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.960
 then you jump all you have 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 Products in your hair that you are too 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 used by heat protection 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.729
 some are the reasons you are 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:47.799
 needs first big jumbo happened yes 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.549
 the link can be found below in the 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.769
 infobox 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:54.129
 This one can be found at Amazon for 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.620
 order an abo and came into play or 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.839
 just what you roughly with her 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.010
 can pull and as he already sees me 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:05.980
 separate because such a piece that is so broad 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.840
 So a partie hair the so wide 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.530
 then curlers will be the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.730
 then finally as you can guess 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.920
 can penetrate 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.480
 then the whole thing speaks masters again 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 very important in this spray bottle 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.220
 Dense have only water in it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 So I only do my hair always 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.970
 again a mast of a scans very important 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 to get the hair really smooth 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.320
 they have to if they are expressed 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.540
 according to numbers so speak each 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 strands of hair I turn a knob once 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 wet with water for a short time 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.960
 the whole thing sounds 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 Now firmly with such clubs on here 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.159
 in addition , there is also the infobox in the thinking 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.350
 so that really tight holds tight and 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.740
 but pulled smoothly because if so 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.030
 just around in the area 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.780
 Of course, Schneider can not do that 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.460
 to become smooth 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.900
 That's why it's usually a bit up 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.450
 you found the right job 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.030
 so that is correct, yes 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.350
 Again, Mr. Super nice but one 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.789
 great approach long super filmed yes that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.280
 I'll do the whole thing with the next one 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.989
 strand I have no exact system 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 So I 'm up on the head or 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.700
 Hair curlers row are located to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.480
 behind the scenes and the pages I do 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.860
 usually without a system just so that 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.320
 I can do it all in any case 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.870
 to go to the beach 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.519
 and yes I have my clever again 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.110
 that I'm stuck again now 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.820
 and that's how it works over and over 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.459
 continue and continue and continue until 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:50.290
 in the end everything is completely up to scratch 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:52.510
 Here super chic and looks like that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.370
 In the end, that's not much 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.989
 work it gets easy from time to time 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.079
 The first time was a bit difficult 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.890
 but then it works and so is great 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.230
 exactly 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.680
 step number two you take now 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.269
 nice and for the whole story 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.850
 I only do it in the medium heat 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.650
 because I do not mean my hair for mine 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.480
 I would like to change my hair between heat 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.860
 expose 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.930
 and I pull that up a bit 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.920
 firmer with the approach right at the first 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.150
 listen something directly becomes a bit smoother 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.190
 I show that here again very briefly 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 Close up I pull the roll 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.269
 a hair curler and a nice one there 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.010
 once over that at least the approach 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.010
 once properly guided smooth 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.939
 then damage is filled and used 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.939
 and filled and felt 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 Of course, there is no buck then 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.209
 You can do something else in time 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:11.079
 It's better to be bored and to be bored 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:21.039
 can also take a break or 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:22.780
 do something like that or not yes that 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.419
 can currently make it all comes 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.789
 do whatever you said you can do 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.699
 Of course you already finished 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.770
 make or make up or depending on whether 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.770
 one day still on the spot 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 you can just as well 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.220
 fingernails paint the alwaysgut or 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 paint as I already share the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.370
 nature when I'm bored and alone 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.080
 with the dry 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.570
 even if a million years passed 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.490
 Days of land grabbing and if I am so 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.620
 really boring it just does it that way 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.750
 as a bet against one of these whole 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.970
 dangerous Dettl women in the 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.970
 marburger street stand and fold 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.410
 or he just makes and makes capable 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.390
 the fund on the day or a day off 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.340
 and just let the whole thing go 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.440
 day on the head it is dry then 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.120
 You can just go to bed or sofa 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:43.740
 put and do with 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.730
 even the whole genre cinema becomes then 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.950
 just taken out 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.890
 then it makes jumped back to from 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.320
 pulls the whole thing out of the hammer then 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:57.530
 first time does not look so great clock 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.480
 Of course that's all a formality 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.120
 so now I know again by I 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.360
 of course it has to say things do it 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.040
 the better our curly hairs are there 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.230
 you have your so much with the 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.450
 To straighten straightening irons has to be smoother 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.760
 yours for nature are all the more 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.820
 of course, the result will be better as well 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.650
 So the very strong curls has as well 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.840
 Of course you will not be there 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.580
 have super saturated results like that 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.920
 someone he gets a few waves from 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.150
 Natours in the hair has but that is 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.420
 Definitely a perfect option 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.400
 not to harm at all and thus 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.100
 they are in curly between beautiful 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.470
 and otherwise some for a nice one 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.470
 day and make something out of it
