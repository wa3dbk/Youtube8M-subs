00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.240 
this kind of thing that's crazy kind of
like<00:01:00.080> its<00:01:00.260> own<00:01:00.410> little<00:01:00.560> theatre<00:01:01.040> show

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
like its own little theatre show

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.040 
like its own little theatre show
basically<00:01:01.520> you're<00:01:01.910> playing<00:01:02.180> your<00:01:02.480> character

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
basically you're playing your character

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.750 
basically you're playing your character
you<00:01:03.260> have<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.560> act<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:04.040> your<00:01:04.220> character<00:01:04.640> you

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
you have to act as your character you

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:21.290 
you have to act as your character you
have<00:01:04.880> to<00:01:05.030> be<00:01:05.240> your<00:01:05.420> character

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.330 

I<00:01:26.540> think<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.690> most<00:01:27.960> people<00:01:28.380> cosplay<00:01:29.010> just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
I think that most people cosplay just

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
I think that most people cosplay just
because<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.050> put<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.440> different

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because we get to put on a different

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
because we get to put on a different
mass<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.910> walk<00:01:33.300> around<00:01:33.480> every<00:01:33.840> day
