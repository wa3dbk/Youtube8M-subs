in<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.460> second<00:00:45.820> half<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:46.210> for<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.390> lot<00:00:46.510> into<00:00:46.690> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in the second half and for a lot into it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.889 
in the second half and for a lot into it
still<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.789> would<00:00:48.940> say<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:51.280> terms<00:00:51.309> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
still you would say in terms of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.669 
still you would say in terms of
executing<00:00:52.899> in<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:54.010> final<00:00:54.429> third<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.379> part

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
executing in the final third that part

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.709 
executing in the final third that part
which<00:00:56.890> was<00:00:57.100> clearly<00:00:57.489> an<00:00:57.820> area<00:00:58.210> where<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:58.539> just

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
which was clearly an area where we just

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.439 
which was clearly an area where we just
didn't<00:00:58.989> do<00:00:59.079> well<00:00:59.199> enough<00:00:59.609> had<00:01:00.609> some<00:01:00.910> good

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
didn't do well enough had some good

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.680 
didn't do well enough had some good
chances<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:03.100> nonetheless<00:01:03.339> not<00:01:04.089> sharpen<00:01:04.600> up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
chances but nonetheless not sharpen up

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.470 
chances but nonetheless not sharpen up
in<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.019> every<00:01:05.110> economist<00:01:05.890> no<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> think<00:01:07.210> we<00:01:07.330> had

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
in it every economist no I think we had

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.600 
in it every economist no I think we had
some<00:01:07.720> periods<00:01:08.200> when<00:01:10.620> we<00:01:11.620> connected<00:01:12.190> passes

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
some periods when we connected passes

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.980 
some periods when we connected passes
but<00:01:12.760> as<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.060> said<00:01:13.120> ideas<00:01:14.080> from<00:01:14.530> zones<00:01:14.830> now<00:01:15.990> how

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
but as I said ideas from zones now how

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.880 
but as I said ideas from zones now how
to<00:01:17.050> place<00:01:17.350> where<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:17.950> views<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.490> wide<00:01:19.000> areas

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to place where one views the wide areas

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.470 
to place where one views the wide areas
no<00:01:20.890> i<00:01:21.010> think<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.370> probably<00:01:21.550> have<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.060> ball

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
no i think we probably have the ball

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.030 
no i think we probably have the ball
what<00:01:22.690> if<00:01:22.780> it's<00:01:22.900> possible<00:01:23.140> still<00:01:23.680> didn't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
what if it's possible still didn't

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.170 
what if it's possible still didn't
didn't<00:01:24.930> didn't<00:01:25.930> finish<00:01:26.110> plays<00:01:26.440> off<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:27.180> we

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
didn't didn't finish plays off on we

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.800 
didn't didn't finish plays off on we
have<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.510> push<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.900> game<00:01:29.080> harder<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.600> that

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
have to push the game harder so in that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.140 
have to push the game harder so in that
regard<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:34.230> accounts<00:01:35.230> for<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.440> lot<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.820> us

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
regard that accounts for a lot of now us

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.140 
regard that accounts for a lot of now us
pushing<00:01:37.900> them<00:01:38.050> back<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.680> course<00:01:38.950> they're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
pushing them back of course they're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.470 
pushing them back of course they're
they're<00:01:40.150> ahead<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.870> they're<00:01:41.050> dropping<00:01:41.620> deeper

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
they're ahead so they're dropping deeper

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.030 
they're ahead so they're dropping deeper
as<00:01:43.480> i<00:01:43.630> said<00:01:43.870> earlier<00:01:43.900> i<00:01:44.260> think<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.800> first

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
as i said earlier i think in the first

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.290 
as i said earlier i think in the first
half<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.860> game<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:49.890> developing<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:52.090> had

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
half as the game is developing we had

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.470 
half as the game is developing we had
the<00:01:52.510> wall<00:01:52.690> up<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:53.920> weren't<00:01:54.310> able<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:55.300> now

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
the wall up but but weren't able to now

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.580 
the wall up but but weren't able to now
take<00:01:56.350> advantage<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.920> some<00:01:56.980> situations<00:01:58.590> what

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
take advantage of some situations what

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.350 
take advantage of some situations what
you<00:01:59.710> don't<00:01:59.830> want<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.160> do<00:02:00.250> with<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.790> that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
you don't want to do with that and that

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.720 
you don't want to do with that and that
is<00:02:01.600> wish<00:02:02.230> it's<00:02:02.410> good<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.680> goal<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.400> want<00:02:03.610> to

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
is wish it's good that goal you want to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.700 
is wish it's good that goal you want to
just<00:02:03.910> keep<00:02:04.150> doing<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.080> good<00:02:05.200> job<00:02:05.260> controlling

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
just keep doing a good job controlling

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.560 
just keep doing a good job controlling
the<00:02:06.220> game<00:02:06.370> controlling<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.120> ball<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.540> the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
the game controlling the ball with the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.120 
the game controlling the ball with the
idea<00:02:07.930> that<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.260> opportunities<00:02:08.920> will<00:02:09.100> come

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
idea that the opportunities will come

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.250 
idea that the opportunities will come
and<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:09.940> put<00:02:10.180> yourself<00:02:10.480> behind<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.960> make<00:02:11.140> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and you put yourself behind you make it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.620 
and you put yourself behind you make it
much<00:02:11.380> more<00:02:11.560> difficult
