00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 take that operation you know what I would look at this new series 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.090
 today also once in but I was again quite a while ago that I 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.150
 the last time very specific, these are included, but you are one of them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.459
 the most popular site number did between 7 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.740
 I do a lot of people to watch 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 and absurdly hayward from the school timers animal to humans too 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.100
 also like a lot of training but I also have a series on playing minutes there 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.530
 is not showing anything on the game minigames only there is nothing wrong with the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.690
 CEOs say allepersberichten.nl to be focused 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 on a specific military that is more or less five weeks I could know 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 not me if I have a specific no longer put aside the only thing nicer to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 to do and what I used to jasper mini games each is no longer possible 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.239
 alinda 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.179
 there is excelsior stores in the neighborhood but this really was a long time ago 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.620
 that i was the last time in the official he pixels shirt i have too 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.100
 made a lot of sense to have made this video four journeys and I hope not to match either 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.210
 did you already have this video would barney with i would really find super super super dope 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 and let's start with this new episode of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.120
 hardcore band and dancers all the time ago when i don't care i go 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.040
 just nice and further and I was watching the last bit 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.730
 namely a hard core server 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.170
 and I didn't really find a nice server so I just decided again 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 went further in the server he picked up a server and that is normal 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.070
 nice even though the country would solve the internet would add it would 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 namely makes me a bit more fun I'm making hardcore games 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 from the first 7 the agency in any case 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.740
 the book are pupil 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.520
 how annoying that I am from those moments when books are covered and that is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960
 just a little bit on me i strongly agree it is very simple actually 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 what should you do you have to pack all the things from the world but then and then 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.630
 play I have this morning with the white neighborhoods the neatest long go 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 you go to bed with steam into the bed with wood 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.880
 that the election intentions 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160
 then still 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.300
 I believe 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.140
 surely 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.550
 team orders as we all match to go with the times with the girl 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.580
 that with her child with the last three four players short 2 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.020
 it really if i have myself 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 and in the game 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 year we take all this for him 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.620
 8 i think i wasps to hear lodeizen i dont know exactly about it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.120
 generally its not even looks short an exodus 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.560
 so if you do not go to shorten my also serious option 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.510
 I naturally kept it in a positive way that it is fun 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.060
 find 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.840
 but that is just clouds but the c30 that is necessary 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.560
 and just tell it for the people the attacker would be divided too bad 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.049
 find 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.799
 shame weather can of course always go to pozole that the video is too short bit 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.469
 weird that you just have to add that there is a video and the one is shorter than the one 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.139
 other that just makes sense 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.379
 You also can't get twenty minutes each time business gets made 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.129
 You can namely also no longer daily cold smits and show up I still have 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.160
 not so much sense so hence 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.980
 it at least the chain has gotten a bit stuck this time too 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.659
 to get 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.469
 he looks 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.649
 at the junction it also became also it also with also became the boiling point 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.499
 such a 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.489
 where fixed 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.449
 both subjects japan 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.859
 but I have to 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.749
 ak that is so on your ears to that place of the incident place in I am myself 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.400
 never that is kind of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.409
 of logic 4 in the hardenbergse that often recur 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.079
 it seems to you what an hour later commit a suicide 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.239
 pacquiao has 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.249
 this year you need a new processor tour du port that writes it 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:33.880
 newspaper 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.490
 with a few so can the number of mixes put third-year students 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.759
 best 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.269
 Paktia therefore really where I was very disappointed with ANP 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.109
 i like this suits then it only comes when we have the same one every time 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:49.780
 play smet 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.609
 I can submit my proposals to the committee will be there 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.899

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.969
 alexander the internet bank to do what is going on fun 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.589
 not serious 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:03.799
 to play 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.729
 athens i got this to what you did so 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.969
 can regret it is pretty big with the makers in short policy 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.769
 just look so there is not was I have I have 6 6 okay which sport st 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.039
 wait fifteen seconds 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.009
 Smith wants a happy fifteen seconds 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.379
 this second wait it is also not the dog as 500 partly who does not want that 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.990
 let's go has released 4 ecb 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.939
 j

 he briefly work through the west of libya becomes light to moderate 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.980
 But it could always be worse that during a bit sick than usual

 they are not good enough to eat in prisons 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.009
 so I find myself myself 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.129
 well a really good blood is a full time it's worth a bit of it 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.699
 minimal bet the pity 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.270
 may they be mine if I am very honest 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.879
