00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.400
 are you going for me it's going great and I'm 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 pleased to have you once again in my 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.810
 company before midnight so that's the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.160
 last video 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.019
 bavans it's a little less of departure from the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.130
 chrono 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.800
 if I do it unexpectedly like that 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.089
 it's just to ask you 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.880
 quick notice but well done so here I 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.680
 I was told to do so on the domain 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.690
 since I can not do it on my 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.130
 nickname on my account since I lost 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.130
 between mails etc 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.030
 so I contacted support our answers 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.490
 I'm going to do it on another character 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.210
 began that ankama responds very very 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.010
 quickly the message he said to me good luck 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.570
 the volume that answers I would have already finished 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.250
 the series so what are we going to do is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.310
 I made a small site 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.670

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.880
 e 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.900
 so I put in the description and on 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.089
 the on the site 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.799

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.219
 find a little a little 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.780
 interrogation where a little like a 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.909
 small Canadian issues 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.149

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.640

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.619
