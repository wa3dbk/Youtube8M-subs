00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.070 
something like send them out with some
scarab<00:02:35.550> swarms<00:02:35.970> I'll<00:02:36.270> sees<00:02:36.540> no<00:02:36.690> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.990> have

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
scarab swarms I'll sees no need to have

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080 
scarab swarms I'll sees no need to have
the<00:02:37.230> resurrection<00:02:37.710> all<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> they

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the resurrection all and they

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.000 
the resurrection all and they
potentially<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.990> other<00:02:40.230> war<00:02:40.770> gear

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
potentially can have other war gear

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.400 
potentially can have other war gear
maybe<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.790> lightning<00:02:42.390> fields<00:02:42.870> or<00:02:42.990> something

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
maybe like lightning fields or something

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.660 
maybe like lightning fields or something
so<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.830> good<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.160> specially<00:02:44.580> with

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
so it's a good one specially with

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.110 
so it's a good one specially with
scallops<00:02:45.120> qualms<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.640> him<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:50.120> then

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
scallops qualms so that's him I then

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.430 
scallops qualms so that's him I then
decided<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.690> make<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.230> lord<00:02:52.920> with<00:02:54.170> staff<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
decided to make a lord with staff of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.240 
decided to make a lord with staff of
light<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> same<00:02:59.640> model<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.330> one

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
light so it's the same model as this one

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.729 
light so it's the same model as this one
obviously<00:03:02.250> converted<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.360> bit<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:04.530> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
obviously converted up a bit like that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.630 
obviously converted up a bit like that
staff<00:03:05.310> there<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.980> wall<00:03:07.980> sized<00:03:08.250> actually

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
staff there that wall sized actually

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.760 
staff there that wall sized actually
attached<00:03:08.910> his<00:03:09.150> legs<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.750> had<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> cut<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.709> off

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
attached his legs I had to cut that off

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.800 
attached his legs I had to cut that off
and<00:03:12.680> put<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> tube<00:03:14.400> making<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.330> into

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and put on a tube making that one into

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.680 
and put on a tube making that one into
staff<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.620> light<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.940> gain<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.630> the

it's got that 50 thing there the Scarab
on<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.890> guy<00:03:26.160> i<00:03:26.220> normally<00:03:26.700> use<00:03:26.730> when<00:03:27.060> i

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
on so on this guy i normally use when i

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.440 
on so on this guy i normally use when i
start<00:03:28.230> playing<00:03:28.500> them<00:03:28.739> darkness<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.239> the

start playing them darkness and the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.140 
start playing them darkness and the
reason<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.799> always<00:03:32.130> find<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
reason for that is always find with the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
reason for that is always find with the
van<00:03:33.299> darkness<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.830> absolutely<00:03:35.640> no<00:03:35.850> point

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
van darkness is absolutely no point

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.729 
van darkness is absolutely no point
sticking<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.410> war<00:03:37.620> scion<00:03:38.660> because<00:03:39.660> usually<00:03:39.930> in

three struck shots there AP three
strengths<00:03:47.190> five<00:03:47.459> they're<00:03:48.269> worth<00:03:48.450> having<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
strengths five they're worth having a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.979 
strengths five they're worth having a
war<00:03:49.799> sie<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.299> worth<00:03:51.420> having<00:03:51.810> because

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
war sie not really worth having because

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.810 
war sie not really worth having because
you<00:03:52.080> your<00:03:52.739> plane<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:52.950> basically<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.790> out

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
you your plane is basically you out

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.900 
you your plane is basically you out
after<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.360> deep<00:03:54.540> striped<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:56.160> i<00:03:56.190> tend<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.670> not

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
after you deep striped so i tend to not

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
after you deep striped so i tend to not
put<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.390> as<00:03:58.049> 10<00:03:58.260> points<00:03:58.530> cheaper<00:03:58.860> as<00:03:58.950> well

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
put it on as 10 points cheaper as well

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.570 
put it on as 10 points cheaper as well
so<00:04:00.930> now<00:04:01.049> there's<00:04:01.680> my<00:04:01.830> guy<00:04:02.040> there<00:04:02.070> normally

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
so now there's my guy there normally

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.070 
so now there's my guy there normally

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
vital really so next next I've got

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.150 
vital really so next next I've got
another<00:05:06.860> destroyer<00:05:07.340> Lord<00:05:08.740> now<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:09.919> droid

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
another destroyer Lord now this droid

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.920 
another destroyer Lord now this droid
law<00:05:10.340> basically<00:05:10.640> means<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.150> he's<00:05:11.510> supposed

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
law basically means that he's supposed

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.330 
law basically means that he's supposed
to<00:05:12.020> be<00:05:12.200> on<00:05:12.669> back<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.140> format<00:05:15.140> but<00:05:15.800> I've<00:05:16.130> got

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
to be on back to the format but I've got

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.730 
to be on back to the format but I've got
in<00:05:16.430> my<00:05:16.550> mac<00:05:16.730> format<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.050> is<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.230> conversion

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
in my mac format so this is a conversion

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.740 
in my mac format so this is a conversion
I<00:05:19.100> mainly<00:05:19.340> dis<00:05:19.610> they<00:05:19.820> did<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.210> because<00:05:20.419> i<00:05:20.630> was

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
I mainly dis they did this because i was

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.250 
I mainly dis they did this because i was
using<00:05:20.990> me<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:22.220> Lord<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:23.600> advance<00:05:23.960> forward

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
using me the Lord to advance forward

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.560 
using me the Lord to advance forward
right<00:05:24.620> with<00:05:24.830> race<00:05:25.070> some<00:05:25.910> really<00:05:26.270> good<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.479> have

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
right with race some really good to have

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.110 
right with race some really good to have
a<00:05:26.600> moderate<00:05:26.960> body<00:05:27.290> I<00:05:27.669> think<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:28.820> probably

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
a moderate body I think it's probably

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.750 
a moderate body I think it's probably
quite<00:05:29.570> a<00:05:29.690> standard<00:05:30.169> conversion<00:05:30.830> nowadays<00:05:31.310> but

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
quite a standard conversion nowadays but

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.140 
quite a standard conversion nowadays but
unlike<00:05:32.270> him<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.889> a<00:05:33.889> little<00:05:34.430> cape<00:05:34.639> on<00:05:34.880> him<00:05:35.030> as
