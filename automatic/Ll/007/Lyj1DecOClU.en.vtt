this afternoon do you think we could

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.120 
this afternoon do you think we could
really<00:03:17.390> rely<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.870> UK<00:03:18.230> farmers<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.890> all<00:03:18.980> our

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
really rely on UK farmers for all our

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.370 
really rely on UK farmers for all our
produce<00:03:19.370> eventually<00:03:20.060> well<00:03:20.959> we're<00:03:21.080> only<00:03:21.230> about

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
produce eventually well we're only about

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.740 
produce eventually well we're only about
sixty<00:03:21.920> three<00:03:22.070> percent<00:03:22.750> self-sufficient

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750

currently<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.769> UK<00:03:25.130> but<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.030> think<00:03:26.209> what's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
currently in the UK but I think what's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.990 
currently in the UK but I think what's
important<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:26.989> UK<00:03:27.560> farmers<00:03:28.040> producing

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
important is that UK farmers producing

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.729 
important is that UK farmers producing
one<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.360> half<00:03:29.390> percent<00:03:29.780> already<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.590> the
