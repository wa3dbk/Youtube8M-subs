00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
and the reason the reason for that is

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.020 
and the reason the reason for that is
that<00:05:10.050> we<00:05:10.830> are<00:05:10.860> not<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.340> Champions<00:05:11.850> League

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
that we are not a Champions League

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.790 
that we are not a Champions League
regular<00:05:12.720> Champions<00:05:13.170> League<00:05:13.320> club<00:05:13.530> anymore

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
and it's a very vicious vicious circle

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.690 
and it's a very vicious vicious circle
unless<00:05:18.630> we<00:05:18.870> can<00:05:19.080> buy<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.500> lot<00:05:19.800> better<00:05:20.160> this

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700
