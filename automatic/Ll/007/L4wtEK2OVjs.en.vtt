when<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.050> think<00:03:43.230> about<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.100> very

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
when we think about this this is very

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.790 
when we think about this this is very
close<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.730> all<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.390> Great<00:03:46.110> Lakes<00:03:46.140> sightings

close to all the Great Lakes sightings

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.470 
close to all the Great Lakes sightings
and<00:03:46.950> now<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.160> big<00:03:47.550> sighting<00:03:47.970> at<00:03:48.090> O'Hare

you're the Science Guy you got to be a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.760 
you're the Science Guy you got to be a
little<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.090> wacky<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.810> think<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> UFOs<00:03:58.740> are

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
little bit wacky to think that UFOs are

little bit wacky to think that UFOs are
down<00:03:59.190> here<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.120> know<00:04:00.209> some<00:04:00.540> some

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
down here and that you know some some

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.810 
down here and that you know some some
people<00:04:01.260> believe<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.590> folks<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.400> actually

the Science Guy well I'm very skeptical

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.580 
the Science Guy well I'm very skeptical
that<00:04:08.880> those<00:04:09.150> photographs<00:04:09.600> are<00:04:10.080> those<00:04:10.200> videos

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that those photographs are those videos

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
hubcap thing looks like it was something

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.750 
hubcap thing looks like it was something
that<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.460> on<00:04:51.520> my<00:04:51.910> show<00:04:53.130> almost<00:04:54.130> ten<00:04:54.370> years<00:04:54.400> ago

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
that was on my show almost ten years ago

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.330 
that was on my show almost ten years ago
we<00:04:55.000> had<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.180> bit<00:04:55.780> called<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.139> hoax<00:04:56.380> or<00:04:56.590> 2000

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
we had a bit called the hoax or 2000

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.550 
we had a bit called the hoax or 2000
where<00:04:57.460> you'd<00:04:57.580> hang<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:58.090> spinning<00:04:58.960> disk<00:04:59.139> from<00:04:59.500> a

where you'd hang a spinning disk from a
fish<00:04:59.950> line<00:05:00.190> it's<00:05:00.790> just<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.180> quality<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.750> the

fish line it's just the quality of the
evidence<00:05:02.020> is<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:02.860> low<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:03.729> this<00:05:04.000> case<00:05:04.240> David

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930

evidence is so low in this case David
why<00:05:05.110> if<00:05:05.380> there's<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.190> compelling<00:05:06.550> good<00:05:06.940> point

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
why if there's a compelling good point
