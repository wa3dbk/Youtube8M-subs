00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.540
 their identity and this video today at the clients spd 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.850
 emmen also see happiness and I am going to make the remake with the world cup and I have the palette 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.010
 really my most favorite also to watch out for lately not being used 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.900
 However, almost daily I thought that would be nice here that you should do it too 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.019
 never experienced this is a whole day in the corner and yes I think so 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.859
 everyone is very well suited to the battle 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.900
 I think it is very emotional and puts a lot of boss over archeology 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.130
 and say well myself, I am well in between time and the colors 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.780
 never happened 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
 what my eyelids 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.340
 to color my eyebrows foxy year that a very nice head in June 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.070
 light skin color and those silly 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.390
 also the delivery is just like if you agree I think it is nice 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.680
 if you have a matt high lights there will be an end wood used in my interior 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 corner of my eye even when the first part of my eyelids p the color by dico 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.290
 from 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.050
 I already have a very nice highlight with a very soft shine 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.340
 at foundation 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 I also think that is very suitable for using your inner corner of the eye 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.340
 bring it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760
 the little animals at the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.680
 and also after 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.140
 first part of my eyelid 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.079
 Suppose that a piece is also highlighted here, just like it looks so beautiful 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.730
 in an outer corner of the eye kpn the color par excellence arm ns itunes went body 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.680
 do quite well the owner will soon only enter 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 so it will be all right 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.040
 and between the light color and this dark campsite choose this because it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.520
 nicely overflowing 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.940
 I just got it there 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 in the lake 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.609
 you will see that we will then become a lot softer 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.499
 well that is really very important to go black mesa color nice soft 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:21.960
 did not walk together 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.910
 and that it will just look a bit natural is the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.179
 usual nice store was before 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.529
 I'm just going to bring myself 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.469
 I am beautiful in each other upwards you will see the dark color in you 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.180
 have therefore applied very nicely into each other 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.469
 and I always think that gives a very nice effect even though no other colors 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 it was mexico 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.669
 now there is much on the path to the trek and tankink and dark brown line 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.870
 undermine the lower lash edge 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.329
 to turn on a little darker with the already beautiful 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.329
 he internship this week 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.549
 and with a pointed tweezers locker that dark color best 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 on that the pencil chalk to blur it nicely 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.199
 then i go with the ai then i go to use dark brown hair live from the 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.329
 hema 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.220
 I use a dark brown that the streets started with a bit of a start 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.149
 end point of the 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.289
 give a nice effect 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.289
 so i just say their thing line upper body upper lash 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.639
 and to top that off and mascara I used her sister Clara's scanning 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.759
 rimmel 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.279

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.850
