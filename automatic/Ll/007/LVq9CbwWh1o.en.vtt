00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:12.370
 Medical care is part of the fact that medical care and management are managed. 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:15.370
 It is why do not I have to a total of one person it if it is an individual 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.050
 We manage it 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.900
 If you ask 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:28.590
 God Tari a lot of accounting relationship Toka or a milk adopted 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 That's what makes the section so independent and wood snowing that day 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 A certain kind of comes to the scale and saw even 2 in about a doctor now 40 people as a medical institution 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.310
 Such indirect part of degree is transmitted 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.410
 If we are small, we can not do such a function 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:53.380
 Furthermore, for example, this hospital has ct, but there are two units for one teacher to treat alone 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:00.370
 So that is 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:06.040
 It is difficult to compare acupuncture and contrast 6 days a week here as a minimum 6 days a week medical treatment 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 When a minimum of six and has a clinic in 7 days a week, 7 days a week by the power 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 If possible on the state teacher in more than eight're 4 is always it to medical now 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:22.460
 It is also a very favorable condition from continuity 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.750
 So when I think of it , that individual dental clinic 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.790
 I say family new primary care 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:36.760
 The first early prevention or a small odorless 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:43.210
 And big medical institution feels like secondary medical institution and more advanced treatment 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:48.330
 Now I am going to make big things even smaller, because I'm going to divide each one into more complex procedures 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.330
 We believe that there is a separation of doing in conjunction with the state where 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.730
 Dr. Suzuki is securing a place to sleep in Tokyo to go back and forth between Tokyo and Nagoya 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.940
 Mansion of older brother ldk in Tokyo 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:16.530
 I wonder if that's strange, but you guys and I 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.530
 Since part Shinkansen is the Ginza and Shinjuku the other Tokyo of question because it is 35 minutes So 1 hour 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.990
 Leaks did you minute empty in considered a person 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.010
 Played 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.010
 Dozens more and more 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:46.760
 Boo Bo Tatsuma Brown rice in a bowl with Uchino Ryoma 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.569
 Early enough 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.659
 Muscle training and gymnastics are essential to keep the intoxication 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.659
 Phew 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.060
 This is a stick with a professional dryer 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 I touch it so much 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.870
 Take care of things 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.870
 Management of stone objects is also important 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:18.400
 Tokyo Shinjuku this day do the doctor had planned to one of the surgery Suzuki 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.400
 Its mainstay is surgery to make bones 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.400
 Tokyo Shinjuku Suzuki is this day 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.400
 Perform the most advanced implant surgery 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.310
 Arrive at Shinjuku Swan Dental on 1 pm on time 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:42.970
 What kind of operation is it? 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:46.240
 And for very little thanks bone of the upper jaw that can not be the infrastructure do and usually 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.010
 I will make a bone surgery 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.590
 If there is a front tooth to say 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.590
 There is such a hollow in the back teeth 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.130
 Because there is such a cavity , even if you try implant in this depth, this actual thickness is 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.680
 Many people have only one eye 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.540
 However 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:21.299
 If you make a bone here and make a hole 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:25.210
 Thus, the maxillary cavity part is completely suspected in the bone 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.970
 This procedure is the thickness of the skull 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:33.080
 Are you about 15 mm 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:40.340
 If you type a very good implant by using a portion of Basoko long as you can 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:43.060
 And at the time of injecting the bone of a reinforcing agent intensity of bone embedded in a thin implant after Wow it is not enough 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.060
 From Umeko 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.980
 Implant main force called sinus lift 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.160
 Without damaging the membrane between the bone and the cavity 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.160
 A high degree of surgery to put the word teaching materials 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.640
 Loss if surgery starts 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.640
 Tah ah ah ah 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.640
 wh 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.330
 Coffee Suzuki made some important decisions during surgery 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.509
 The brainstem likes to take in in anxiety but d anemia half is in Shiga 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.120
 Usually after feeding a bone reinforcement 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:37.260
 If you wait for half a year to set , then insert the implant 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:38.520
 Since the bone strength of the book was to some extent, it was judged that the injection of the teaching material and the implant could be done simultaneously. 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.099
 What 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.099
 It is a treatment unique to experienced Dr. Suzuki 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.300
 The burden on the patient who finished the operation was done only once 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:01.440
 Another This is the feeling at that luck + and the universe and virtuoso Yes, once 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.500
 It is to be described in a single election 2 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:13.110
 When you look at the red photos, the impland is firmly embedded 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:19.689
 This rich knowledge and experience of Dr. Suzuki is a great benefit to the staff as well 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:26.349
 It is also necessary to train staff who will acquire such advanced skills 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:28.660
 Program for the training of doctors and dentists Suzuki doctor is a qualified small business consultant in now 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:33.390
 Set out to make 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.790
 In the case of a general company, there should be a system that should be naturally 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:42.220
 Manual system even in the underground city 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:48.610
 Since the 4 specifications of the manual March, so it makes no sense how to check it 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:54.730
 Is how anyone or mechanical say to the innovation we month against each 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:55.060
 Come bait Tsuhito is quite 2 in the people it says do not be able to buy anything with money so you can buy 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.820
 Absent 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.780
 The 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.969
 After training good human resources and citrine 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:08.090
 It is important 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:11.990
 It is important to recruit various good people and to develop good people 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:16.160
 Oh and dental clinic gaze Suzuki doctor 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:20.440
 To save the organization for good medical care 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.800
 Do you have 80% or more human problems ? 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.639
 No matter how raising the dolly human resources 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.009
 It's the staff that you 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:31.659
 Or you have to work for the above 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.659
 I think that's all 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.370
 We welcome an aging society 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:43.470
 People who have troubles with teeth do n't increase 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:48.450
 Implant treatment can be said to lead to its solution 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:52.100
 The future is to wear the correct knowledge of implant treatment 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.100
 It will be important
