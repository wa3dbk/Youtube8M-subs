video<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.670> helpful<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.300> guys<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> let<00:00:22.769> me

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
video was helpful for you guys so let me

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000 
video was helpful for you guys so let me
start<00:00:22.949> off<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> form<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.330> basic<00:00:24.689> point

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
start off with the form the basic point

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.179 
start off with the form the basic point
so<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.460> 361<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:28.170> snaps<00:00:28.410> into<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> bottom

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so the 361 just snaps into the bottom

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.749 
so the 361 just snaps into the bottom
and<00:00:30.289> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.619> fits<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:32.040> hair<00:00:32.279> pretty<00:00:32.430> well

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and you know it fits my hair pretty well

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.470 
and you know it fits my hair pretty well
I<00:00:32.790> kinda<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.070> um<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.430> ps3<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.180> here

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.369 

I<00:00:46.800> guess<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.340> say<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.420> type<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.170> have

I guess you can say when i type I have

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.830 
I guess you can say when i type I have
to<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:50.039> doesn't<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.969> hand<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.690> up

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to it doesn't really my hand as a bit up

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
to it doesn't really my hand as a bit up
here<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.100> type<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.610> fingers

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here to just you know type my fingers

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
here to just you know type my fingers
would<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.360> fit<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
would be really fit there so I have to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.349 
would be really fit there so I have to
move<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.250> hand<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.870> awkward<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.359> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
move my hand up a little awkward and you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
move my hand up a little awkward and you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
know I actually have to go closer just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.640 
know I actually have to go closer just
too<00:01:03.090> tight<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.989> letters<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.470> really

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
too tight because the letters are really

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.210 
too tight because the letters are really
small<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.790> keys<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.380> small<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
small the keys are really small and so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.090 
small the keys are really small and so
are<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> letters<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> keyboard<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:11.010> of

quite<00:03:22.980> executed<00:03:23.980> right<00:03:24.600> because<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:26.829> jumps<00:03:27.549> on

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
quite executed right because it jumps on

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.240 
quite executed right because it jumps on
the<00:03:27.880> screen<00:03:28.269> when<00:03:28.510> you're<00:03:29.440> trying<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.799> use<00:03:29.859> it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
the screen when you're trying to use it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.539 
the screen when you're trying to use it
it's<00:03:31.030> hard<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.420> hit<00:03:32.200> small<00:03:32.709> buttons<00:03:33.130> or

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
it's hard to hit small buttons or

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's hard to hit small buttons or
anything<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.359> link<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:36.310> really

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
anything on a link so that is really

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.789 
anything on a link so that is really
it's<00:03:37.819> kind<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.150> pointless<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.959> would<00:03:39.379> actually

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
it's kind of pointless I would actually

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.130 
it's kind of pointless I would actually
rather<00:03:40.099> just<00:03:40.430> use<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.760> analogues<00:03:41.299> instead<00:03:41.989> of

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
rather just use the analogues instead of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.759 
rather just use the analogues instead of
this<00:03:42.290> keyboard<00:03:43.930> functions<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.500> it's

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
this keyboard functions so it's

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.099 
this keyboard functions so it's
definitely<00:03:46.159> kind<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.849> fail<00:03:47.060> for<00:03:47.390> me<00:03:47.480> so

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
definitely kind of a fail for me so

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.970 
definitely kind of a fail for me so
that's<00:03:48.680> basically<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.459> ps3<00:03:50.390> keyboard<00:03:50.989> let's

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that's basically the ps3 keyboard let's

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.860 
that's basically the ps3 keyboard let's
talk<00:03:52.159> more<00:03:52.430> about<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.849> xbox<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:54.430> here<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.549> is
