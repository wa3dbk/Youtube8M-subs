00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.329
 so hello to all 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.960
 the thing here is a good 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.309
 at the beginning difficult 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 below as usual the coup de grace in France 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.529
 so to start 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.550
 you have to position your hood 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 so anyway 15 2 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 then the first chord in this set 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.690
 so 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.220
 you have to position your finger 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 in case 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 second string box of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 p before last rope breaks 3 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.400
 and so if you pass 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.270
 you thought the first 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.890
 and the penultimate 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.560
 twenty-two houses 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.660
 so to three for the first stone in last place strong 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
 and you scratch the 3rd 4th and 5th 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 then the second chord is like the ground you lose your little finger finally 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 your finger here in box 3 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.570
 on the a2 of the penultimate rope 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800
 and you just have to shift the index and middle finger of a barracks 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 so that gives 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.120
 and you always have it the same way 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 that the second agreement for the grahter lapeyrouse-mornay 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.990
 you scratch the second transcendent of course the front back 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.399
 this scholarship 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.919
 I'm happy to be at the best 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.959
 so for the agreement 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.789
 you think 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.669
 all the terminals is the 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.899
 the third the fourth and the fifth at the same time 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.899
 and you keep the problem okay that the first of five soldiers 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.549
 so that must agree 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.649
 the arcep the second agreement that the second 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.099
 so it's a symbol 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.419
 but with him the vexer major staggered a box at the bottom 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.879
 so in second procession 3 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.909
 third rope box of departure 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.599
 and 5th string breaks 3 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.199
 and you think 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.189
 you think of it this way 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.349
 party second rope 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.349
 fourth and fifth 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.629
 so this agreement there 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.629
 it's first box 2 strings 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 a fourth body box 2 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 and 5th corsair 3 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.909
 so that's true 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.680
 you think the first rope the third 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
 fourth and fifth 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.719
 q you come back on a floor 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.369
 we think so far the first 3rd 4th 5th at the same time 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.460
 six months ago 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.460
 it comes from tons 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.599
 the markstein 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.710
 usual port-gentil 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.129
 this is the third string 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.300
 KZ2 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 for you thought in celebration 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.009
 abid 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 no doubt 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.659
 not a Corsican 15 2 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.569
 second corner 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.469
 yes third box 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.469
 first time 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
 and second rope to Lille 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.990
 courtyard 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.259
 after the summit 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.009
 back from bassong 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.189
 so then to take it back 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.189
 on a floor 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 darren bent 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.779
 for the title interlude 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.919
 it is 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.999
 penultimate body 15 3 passing the last acquired 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.409
 both were increased to 5 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.339
 but then you go back third like to the fourth body box 2 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.499
 and then cascade 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:51.949
 thinking 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.129
 hold and deadlines 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:54.849
 the two penultimate 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.050
 so you should think 4th and 5th at the same time 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.759
 so that will give
