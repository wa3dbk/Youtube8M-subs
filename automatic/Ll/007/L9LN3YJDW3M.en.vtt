00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and I was having some serious trouble

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
and I was having some serious trouble
getting<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> waited<00:00:36.090> till<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:36.450> home

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
getting off so I waited till I got home

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
getting off so I waited till I got home
and<00:00:37.469> broken<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.190> hair<00:00:38.370> scissors

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and broken up hair scissors

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
and broken up hair scissors
but<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.450> figure<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> can

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
but I figure if I like this then I can

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.310 
but I figure if I like this then I can
go<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> Walgreens<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.480> pick<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.989> another

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
go back to Walgreens and pick up another

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
go back to Walgreens and pick up another
one<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.789> dollar

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
one for a dollar

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
one for a dollar
and<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.660> pretty<00:00:45.809> sure<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.829> was

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and I'm pretty sure this was only it was

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.910 
and I'm pretty sure this was only it was
either<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.219> dollar<00:00:47.460> ninety-nine<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.300> $2.99<00:00:48.920> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
either a dollar ninety-nine or $2.99 and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.979 
either a dollar ninety-nine or $2.99 and
for<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> life<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> me<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.820> can't<00:00:51.059> remember<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
for the life of me I can't remember so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.180 
for the life of me I can't remember so
I'm<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.410> gonna<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> same<00:00:52.890> thing<00:00:53.100> as

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I'm just gonna do the same thing as

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
I'm just gonna do the same thing as
before<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:54.059> put<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.469> lips<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
before I'm gonna put it on my lips and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
before I'm gonna put it on my lips and
tell<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.270> feels<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.930> tacky<00:00:58.199> if

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tell you how it feels if it's tacky if

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
tell you how it feels if it's tacky if
it's<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.010> drawing<00:00:59.250> whatever<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.140> let<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it's really drawing whatever and let you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's really drawing whatever and let you
know<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.770> wears<00:01:01.890> throughout<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> day<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
know how it wears throughout the day so

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
know how it wears throughout the day so
I'll<00:01:02.640> come<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.570> three<00:01:03.750> times<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I'll come back to you or three times and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
I'll come back to you or three times and
let<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> goes<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.000> really

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
let you know how it goes and I'm really

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
let you know how it goes and I'm really
hoping<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> good<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.920> tend

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
hoping that this is good because I tend

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130 
hoping that this is good because I tend
to<00:01:08.729> gravitate<00:01:09.060> towards<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:09.869> really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to gravitate towards I actually really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.940 
to gravitate towards I actually really
like<00:01:10.350> lip<00:01:10.640> liquid<00:01:11.640> lip<00:01:12.450> colors<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
like lip liquid lip colors and it is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
like lip liquid lip colors and it is
liquidy<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> consistency<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
liquidy it is like the consistency of a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.219 
liquidy it is like the consistency of a
very<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:20.220> wet<00:01:20.640> gloss<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.750> very<00:01:22.020> liquidy

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
very very wet gloss it's very liquidy

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
very very wet gloss it's very liquidy
I'm<00:01:22.560> hoping<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> doesn't<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.759> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I'm hoping that it doesn't like go

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'm hoping that it doesn't like go
terribly<00:01:25.250> all<00:01:26.250> over<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> place

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
terribly all over the place

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.790 
terribly all over the place
but<00:01:27.420> let's<00:01:28.170> give<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> shot

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800 

I<00:01:32.770> like<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.980> applicator<00:01:34.540> even<00:01:35.540> though<00:01:35.660> it's

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
I like the applicator even though it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.710 
I like the applicator even though it's
long<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.680> really<00:01:37.160> flexible<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.570> good

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
long it's really flexible so it's good

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:53.859 
long it's really flexible so it's good
for<00:01:41.870> like<00:01:41.990> getting<00:01:42.080> in<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.350> corner<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.710> my<00:01:42.740> lip

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.410 

it's<00:01:54.770> definitely<00:01:55.009> drying<00:01:55.579> really<00:01:55.939> quickly

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
it's definitely drying really quickly

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.709 
it's definitely drying really quickly
like<00:01:56.719> really<00:01:57.140> quickly<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.710> not<00:01:58.719> it's

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
like really quickly and not it's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.630 
like really quickly and not it's
becoming<00:01:59.990> pretty<00:02:00.200> tacky<00:02:00.560> not<00:02:00.890> sticky<00:02:01.399> like<00:02:01.579> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
becoming pretty tacky not sticky like a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.609 
becoming pretty tacky not sticky like a
gloss<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.210> not<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.359> goopy<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:02.929> it's<00:02:03.049> tacky<00:02:03.469> so

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
gloss it's not a goopy but it's tacky so

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.919 
gloss it's not a goopy but it's tacky so
when<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.950> pressed<00:02:04.189> my<00:02:04.310> lips<00:02:04.340> together<00:02:04.929> you

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
when I like pressed my lips together you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.259 
when I like pressed my lips together you
can<00:02:06.079> kind<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.289> see<00:02:06.439> them<00:02:06.560> pulling<00:02:06.979> apart<00:02:07.269> and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
can kind of see them pulling apart and

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.509 
can kind of see them pulling apart and
sticking<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.989> themselves<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.069> creating

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
sticking to themselves and it's creating

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.759 
sticking to themselves and it's creating
a<00:02:10.580> lit<00:02:10.879> sky<00:02:11.420> 'nope<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.780> chi<00:02:11.840> application<00:02:12.560> but

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
because it's still slightly tacky but

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.270 
because it's still slightly tacky but
it's<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.989> feels<00:02:27.319> almost<00:02:27.650> completely<00:02:27.920> dry<00:02:28.069> at

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's it feels almost completely dry at

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's it feels almost completely dry at
this<00:02:28.370> point

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040 

great<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.860> was<00:02:39.010> just<00:02:39.160> taking<00:02:39.459> my<00:02:39.490> pinky<00:02:40.050> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
great and I was just taking my pinky and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.460 
great and I was just taking my pinky and
kind<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.260> bouncing<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.770> off<00:02:41.830> my<00:02:42.069> lips<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.810> help

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
kind of bouncing it off my lips to help

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.920 
kind of bouncing it off my lips to help
blend<00:02:44.860> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.970> lines<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.660> it's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
blend in the lines because it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.559 
blend in the lines because it's
definitely<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.430> patchy<00:02:48.670> application<00:02:49.390> but

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
definitely it's a patchy application but

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.199 
definitely it's a patchy application but
this<00:02:49.690> color<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.170> pretty<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.470> want<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.890> work

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
this color so pretty I want it to work

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.320 
this color so pretty I want it to work
so<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.080> how<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.770> looks<00:02:54.190> right<00:02:54.580> now<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.240> it

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
so this is how it looks right now and it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.120 
so this is how it looks right now and it
is<00:02:55.450> slightly<00:02:55.900> patchy<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.560> honestly<00:02:56.890> unless

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
is slightly patchy but honestly unless

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.920 
is slightly patchy but honestly unless
you're<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:57.520> this<00:02:57.820> close<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.330> me<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.630> don't

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
think that that's gonna be something

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.240 
think that that's gonna be something
good<00:03:00.850> notice<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:02.200> did<00:03:02.410> transfer<00:03:02.920> quite<00:03:03.220> a

actually it kiss test no transfer which
is<00:03:43.720> really<00:03:44.049> exciting<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.190> think<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.209> I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
is really exciting so I think that if I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.199 
is really exciting so I think that if I
kind<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.110> practice<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.010> learn<00:03:48.430> how<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.760> give<00:03:49.180> a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
kind of practice and learn how to give a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.180 
kind of practice and learn how to give a
really<00:03:49.600> even<00:03:50.049> application<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.769> first<00:03:50.799> time

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
really even application the first time

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.330 
really even application the first time
around<00:03:51.310> it'll<00:03:52.239> look<00:03:52.989> really<00:03:53.230> good<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.070> lasts

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
around it'll look really good and lasts

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.130 
around it'll look really good and lasts
all<00:03:54.610> day<00:03:54.640> because<00:03:55.000> right<00:03:55.450> now<00:03:55.630> let's<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:55.989> if<00:03:56.079> I

this<00:06:11.650> one<00:06:12.010> in<00:06:12.190> particular<00:06:12.340> it's<00:06:12.910> very<00:06:13.060> chalky

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
this one in particular it's very chalky

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.590 
this one in particular it's very chalky
my<00:06:14.770> favorite<00:06:15.430> matte<00:06:15.669> lip<00:06:15.880> products<00:06:16.360> are

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
my favorite matte lip products are

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
my favorite matte lip products are
probably<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.350> NYX<00:06:17.650> liquid<00:06:17.950> matte<00:06:19.169> products<00:06:20.169> I

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
probably the NYX liquid matte products I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.460 
probably the NYX liquid matte products I
think<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.520> liquid<00:06:21.870> lipsticks<00:06:22.870> as<00:06:23.110> well

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
think that a liquid lipsticks as well

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.760 
think that a liquid lipsticks as well
but<00:06:23.770> they're<00:06:23.950> their<00:06:24.190> matte<00:06:24.460> like<00:06:24.970> lipstick

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
but they're their matte like lipstick

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.409 
but they're their matte like lipstick
and<00:06:26.770> those<00:06:27.250> don't<00:06:27.550> leave<00:06:27.730> a<00:06:27.760> chalky<00:06:28.090> feel

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
and those don't leave a chalky feel

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.880 
and those don't leave a chalky feel
where<00:06:28.660> this<00:06:28.810> is<00:06:28.990> definitely<00:06:29.200> living<00:06:29.410> a<00:06:29.590> chalky

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
where this is definitely living a chalky

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.710 
where this is definitely living a chalky
field<00:06:30.070> but<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.310> longevity<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:30.910> this<00:06:31.180> is

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
field but the longevity of this is

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.950 
field but the longevity of this is
definitely<00:06:32.680> better<00:06:33.419> so<00:06:34.419> it's<00:06:34.600> kind<00:06:34.780> of<00:06:34.810> like

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
definitely better so it's kind of like

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.870 
definitely better so it's kind of like

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
L'Oreal has one so I thought maybe

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.400
