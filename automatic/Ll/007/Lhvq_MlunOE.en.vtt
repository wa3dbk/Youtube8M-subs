00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
now to get now you're gonna have to move

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.440 
now to get now you're gonna have to move
on<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.460> second<00:03:39.880> part<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.240> base

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
on to like the second part of the base

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:49.530 
on to like the second part of the base
it<00:03:41.080> goes<00:03:41.290> ok<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.370> then<00:03:48.490> you<00:03:48.610> can<00:03:48.730> return<00:03:48.880> but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
I'm so the second part is a bit

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.730 
I'm so the second part is a bit
different<00:03:51.810> there's<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.900> lot<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.170> similarities

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
different there's a lot of similarities

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.140 
different there's a lot of similarities
but<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> little<00:03:54.250> bit<00:03:54.370> different<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:54.880> but

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
but it's a little bit different in but

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.260 
but it's a little bit different in but
the<00:03:55.330> main<00:03:55.540> difference<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:56.020> 2<00:03:56.260> chord<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.400> for

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
the main difference is 2 chord so for

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.760 
the main difference is 2 chord so for
this<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.810> want<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.080> put<00:03:59.230> your<00:03:59.350> first<00:03:59.620> finger
