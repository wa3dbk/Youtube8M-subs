the<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.720> most<00:01:15.900> concerned<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the thing we're most concerned about is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
the thing we're most concerned about is
we<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.830> momentum<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.360> been<00:01:18.570> taken<00:01:18.960> away

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we had momentum and it's been taken away

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.539 
we had momentum and it's been taken away
so<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> keep<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> momentum<00:01:20.009> somehow

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so we got to keep that momentum somehow

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.210 
so we got to keep that momentum somehow
