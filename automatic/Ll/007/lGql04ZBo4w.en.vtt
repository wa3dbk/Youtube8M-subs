00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.439
 install the online consultant widget on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.199
 your website can be any 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.019
 website or even some single page 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 but since I only have a website 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.920
 now on yukoz 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 then I'll show it here but 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 also we will come back a little later to that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 how can this be done on various 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.219
 engines what are you using we will 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 she widget and consultant from siteheart 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 it is a very good analogue especially since 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.289
 there is a great free rate which 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.199
 it is fine that I have 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.530
 you already need an account 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.649
 to register 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 if you haven't done it yet 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 registration but since I already 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.600
 I can register, I can just 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.600
 to come in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 so on sparring no control panel 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
 admin site here here we are 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 We will track our visitors and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.950
 actually manage them through dialogues 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 but first we need to install it ourselves 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.350
 widget on our site so visitors 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.289
 visiting our website could communicate with you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 well there is also quite a lot 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.530
 various other settings about which we 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.259
 talk a little later so move on 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.039
 created widget settings are looking to customize 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:43.229
 our widget to install it on our website 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:48.450
 so well here in my opinion I left everything as 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.560
 there was design well on my website design 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.060
 such a gray gray green blue such 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 I can leave accordingly 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.009
 or green green 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.920
 or gray 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.140
 than without a difference so the message is all in 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.310
 principle doesn't matter you can customize everything 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 on your own 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.580
 and here we take this code on the page 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 widget code and well through my panel 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.640
 control I'll set it up now 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.520
 your website 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 this can be done on all pages 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 site on certain advise 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 install bayonet body 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.990
 but here so that he is standing up to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.170
 closing this job for example so i am 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.820
 I will not do this and I will install it in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:47.630
 the bottom of the site still work 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:50.610
 Must be smart page in our site and 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.310
 here we have help online 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.800
 Well, accordingly, you can of course 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 we can change for ourselves 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 change some settings here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.420
 widget and they will automatically change 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.850
 On our site, for example, at least 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.390
 so it should be here I changed to 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.430
 green update and he's already 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.390
 green as well as you can see everything is enough 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.570
 simply 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.030
 Now let's look at the example that you already 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.640
 That is, I went to the beds as you on 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.489
 site as a visitor we go in 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.920
 tab visitors and after all and see that 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.590
 defined here also 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.120
 my pi address and location which 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.920
 By the way, not right, but also 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.269
 what browser and operating system is shown 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.290
 system we use 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:44.730
 well and accordingly we can do 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.720
 so for example the visitor clicks on 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.350
 online help 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.700
 and now there is a connection with the operator 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.790
 as you see we have appeared here 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.700
 the red one is an active query 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 on dialogue we click on it click 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 here we go to our dialogue with 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.160
 operator's side automatically 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.959
 the message is sent hello than i am 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.489
 I can help you, respectively, we 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.320
 here we write something backwards 1 2 3 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.530
 Well, as if there appears that is 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.820
 nothing special is important 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.750
 on installation yes I think here already 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.800
 figure it out yourself 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.290
 There are also analytics various settings 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.310
 you can add operators there and do 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.930
 so on this with this you figure it out I 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.060
 I think on my own nothing complicated here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.139
 no now what about the installation 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.080
 this widget to other sites on 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:48.980
 other content management systems so 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 let's go in the application plugins here you 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.169
 can automatically install this 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.960
 heart plugin site to manage it 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.750
 directly without code but just like 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.320
 plugin your cms management system 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.910
