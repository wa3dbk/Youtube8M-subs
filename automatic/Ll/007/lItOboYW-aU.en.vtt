00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.910
 professional racer party 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.050
 championship of Russia on drifting and now 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.039
 he is disguised as a regular buyer and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 used cars 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.940
 good afternoon, yes, choosing a machine 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.250
 what a beautiful 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.559
 and how much does such a pony cost in general 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.839
 Basically, I will say my sentences, yes, I 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.510
 come for a car of thousands for 300 can 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.670
 It is something we have 300 people 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.489
 you girls video to these cars 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.320
 as if to say a good thing really 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.970
 if you take it and take an hour to take good 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.040
 and by the way I have very good 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.729
 loan offer here because u 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.910
 I'm not from a million, but who has it 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:20.869
 really take a ride now 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.380
 that is, I can drive to get to 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.880
 of course I want to give it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:31.130
 good worth it please here y 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 we are now very good 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.080
 Credits seller-consultant certainly not 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.039
 guesses that our racer is in front of him 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.770
 driver wants to ride on gt86 toyota 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.200
 and in the meantime our man is unnoticed 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.990
 installs hidden cameras on the machine and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:56.510
 so the show starts let's try this way 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.760
 how to start a review 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.760
 which one is convenient let's try 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.730
 phil all good nokia don't worry 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 all is well 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:19.940
 cars are good how are you all dorman rubbing 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.940
 brakes fireplace too good 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 still don't care we played it out 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.770
 worried 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.770
 benefit 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.490
 well and at last about the received impressions 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.950
 but at first he was there something began to pull 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.010
 back and forth I feel the guy either 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.650
 mechanics on the box did not go or not 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.600
 having taught the sharpness of the engine to the beginning when you 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.400
 drove off of course had to create 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.590
 the impression that I can't ride 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.080
 with manual transmission 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.900
 all the more so powerful and of course we 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.110
 several times almost stalled sharply 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.640
 braked a couple of times so that two people 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 even more begin to fear from the fact that 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.450
 understood that the driver was sitting full 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.100
 amateur general is managed well for 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.140
 except that electronic systems 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.940
 do not turn off completely with the buttons then 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.290
 there are buttons we will try to turn off 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.620
 but they don't care in the case of drift 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.080
 do not give the car food to enter 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.910
 hold on to us here in this by us 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.980
 the problem is that too much electronics in 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.260
 car it does not give a person and take 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.669
 decisions with mom doing everything for him 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.669
 even what he doesn't want to do
