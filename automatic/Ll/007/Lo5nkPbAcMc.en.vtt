00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you're going to fold it diagonal you're

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.100 
you're going to fold it diagonal you're
always<00:00:49.260> keeping<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.010> corner<00:00:50.520> free<00:00:51.450> here<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
always keeping this corner free here and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
always keeping this corner free here and
just<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.579> remember<00:00:54.000> making<00:00:54.390> paper

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
