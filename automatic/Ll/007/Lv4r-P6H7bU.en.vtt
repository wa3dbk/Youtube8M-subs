all right so our next topic is blood
sugar<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.770> really<00:00:05.400> popular<00:00:05.609> one

sugar and this is a really popular one
with<00:00:06.509> all<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> clients<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.470> talk<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.950> because<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
feel like when I started in my practice

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.320 
feel like when I started in my practice
ten<00:00:10.889> years<00:00:11.130> ago<00:00:11.250> when<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.910> would<00:00:12.090> talk<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
ten years ago when I would talk to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
ten years ago when I would talk to
people<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:12.840> their<00:00:13.080> blood<00:00:13.230> pressure<00:00:13.559> they

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
people about their blood pressure they

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.250 
people about their blood pressure they
may<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:15.150> may<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.690> known<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> was

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
may or may not have known what it was

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620 
may or may not have known what it was
and<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.609> oh<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.330> friend

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
and it was kind of like oh my friend

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920 
and it was kind of like oh my friend
over<00:00:18.750> there<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.410> diabetes<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> feel

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
over there has diabetes and now I feel

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
over there has diabetes and now I feel
like<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.320> everybody<00:00:22.859> knows<00:00:23.070> somebody<00:00:23.400> who's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
like it's everybody knows somebody who's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.560 
like it's everybody knows somebody who's
diabetic<00:00:24.300> um<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.029> over<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
diabetic um you know it's all over the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.830 
diabetic um you know it's all over the
place

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
place

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.570 
place
so<00:00:28.170> blood<00:00:28.560> sugar<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> something<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
so blood sugar is something that is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
so blood sugar is something that is
really<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.029> concerning<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.109> most<00:00:31.529> diets

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
really really concerning in most diets

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
really really concerning in most diets
regardless<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> where<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> live<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.870> old<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
regardless of where you live how old you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.760 
regardless of where you live how old you
are<00:00:34.320> um<00:00:35.210> blood<00:00:36.210> sugar<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> big<00:00:36.870> issue<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.710> we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
are um blood sugar is a big issue now we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
are um blood sugar is a big issue now we
do<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.579> blood<00:00:38.879> sugar<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> comes

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
do think about blood sugar when it comes

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170 
do think about blood sugar when it comes
to<00:00:39.840> diabetes<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.590> basically<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.670> happens

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
to diabetes and basically what happens

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.709 
to diabetes and basically what happens
is<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.989> eat<00:00:43.789> carbohydrates<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:45.450> sugar

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
is when you eat carbohydrates or sugar

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
is when you eat carbohydrates or sugar
of<00:00:45.899> any<00:00:46.079> sort<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.219> goes<00:00:47.730> through<00:00:47.910> your

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of any sort that goes through your

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.660 
of any sort that goes through your
digestive<00:00:48.480> system<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:49.140> quickly<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.860> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
digestive system pretty quickly and then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.420 
digestive system pretty quickly and then
once<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.239> hits<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.870> bloodstream<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:53.160> acts

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
once it hits your bloodstream it acts

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
once it hits your bloodstream it acts
like<00:00:53.670> no<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.180> nutrient<00:00:54.750> does<00:00:54.920> proteins<00:00:55.920> fat

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like no other nutrient does proteins fat

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
like no other nutrient does proteins fat
they<00:00:56.399> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:56.820> their<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.149> getting<00:00:57.719> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they kind of take their time getting in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
they kind of take their time getting in
your<00:00:57.930> bloodstream<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:59.190> carbohydrates<00:00:59.850> get

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
your bloodstream but carbohydrates get

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
your bloodstream but carbohydrates get
it<00:01:00.180> immediately<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it immediately and you have that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.789 
it immediately and you have that
immediate<00:01:02.129> rise<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.940> blood<00:01:03.180> sugar<00:01:03.589> then<00:01:04.589> what

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
immediate rise in blood sugar then what

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
immediate rise in blood sugar then what
happens<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> signal<00:01:06.390> sent<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
happens is you get this signal sent to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
happens is you get this signal sent to
your<00:01:07.049> pancreas<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.880> your<00:01:08.880> pancreas<00:01:09.450> releases

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
your pancreas and your pancreas releases

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.010 
your pancreas and your pancreas releases
insulin<00:01:10.070> then<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> insulin<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> hormone<00:01:12.020> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
insulin then the insulin is a hormone so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
insulin then the insulin is a hormone so
it's<00:01:13.140> released<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.740> takes<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.430> blood

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's released it takes all that blood

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
it's released it takes all that blood
sugar<00:01:14.909> swooshes<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> into<00:01:16.080> yourself<00:01:16.460> where

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sugar swooshes it into yourself where

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
sugar swooshes it into yourself where
your<00:01:17.790> cells<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> blood<00:01:19.439> sugar<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
your cells then use that blood sugar to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.010 
your cells then use that blood sugar to
do<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> things<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.479> help<00:01:21.900> give

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
do the things they need to do help give

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
do the things they need to do help give
you<00:01:22.110> energy<00:01:22.560> help<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> focus<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:23.880> you're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you energy help you focus when you're

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.080 
you energy help you focus when you're
work<00:01:24.409> all<00:01:25.409> those<00:01:25.799> things<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
work all those things that we think of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
work all those things that we think of
that<00:01:27.330> carbohydrates<00:01:28.290> actually<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> are

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that carbohydrates actually do that are

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.140 
that carbohydrates actually do that are
good<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.369> us<00:01:29.630> however<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.140> problem<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.150> again

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
good for us however the problem is again

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.190 
good for us however the problem is again
we<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.990> too<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:35.299> there<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> diets<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
we get too much there we have diets that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.319 
we get too much there we have diets that
are<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.409> too<00:01:37.470> high<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> sugar<00:01:38.579> way<00:01:38.939> too<00:01:39.000> high

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
are way too high and sugar way too high

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
are way too high and sugar way too high
and<00:01:39.540> refined<00:01:40.070> carbs<00:01:41.070> therefore<00:01:42.030> our<00:01:42.590> pantries

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and refined carbs therefore our pantries

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
and refined carbs therefore our pantries
just<00:01:43.829> kinda<00:01:44.310> gets<00:01:44.460> tired<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.750> able

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
just kinda gets tired and it's not able

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020 
just kinda gets tired and it's not able
to<00:01:46.500> produce<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.130> insulin<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> needs

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to produce as much insulin as it needs

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230 
to produce as much insulin as it needs
it's<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.689> able<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> keep<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it's not able to keep up and so what

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's not able to keep up and so what
happens<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.020> blood<00:01:53.009> sugar<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> then

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
happens is that blood sugar is then

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870 
happens is that blood sugar is then
stored<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.210> fat<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.380> body<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> eventually

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
stored as fat in the body and eventually

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
stored as fat in the body and eventually
your<00:01:57.030> pancreas<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.719> starts<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.710> working<00:01:59.130> as

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
your pancreas just starts not working as

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.899 
your pancreas just starts not working as
well<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> should

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
well as it should

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
well as it should
that's<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.899> somebody<00:02:01.200> tends<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> go<00:02:01.710> on

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's when somebody tends to go on

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.730 
that's when somebody tends to go on
insulin<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
insulin that's when you get the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910 
insulin that's when you get the
diagnosis<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> diabetes<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.560> really

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
diagnosis of diabetes so it's really

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.910 
diagnosis of diabetes so it's really
important<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:09.200> what<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.440> blood<00:02:10.590> sugar

feel like well I can do this I can live

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.630 
feel like well I can do this I can live
with<00:02:20.280> diabetes<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.270> but<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.370> goal

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
with diabetes and you can but the goal

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.760 
with diabetes and you can but the goal
would<00:02:23.820> be<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.570> go<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.960> medication<00:02:25.590> with
