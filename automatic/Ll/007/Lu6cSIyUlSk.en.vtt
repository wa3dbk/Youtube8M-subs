up<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.460> cut<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.420> too<00:00:12.750> much<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
up here that I cut out too much of the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.900 
up here that I cut out too much of the
material<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.190> left<00:00:14.400> me<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
material and it left me with about a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.990 
material and it left me with about a
half<00:00:15.089> inch<00:00:15.299> gap<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.379> had<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.699> make<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> patch

half inch gap that I had to make a patch
I<00:00:18.210> had<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> separate<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.650> filler

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I had to make a separate little filler

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.599 
I had to make a separate little filler
panel<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.850> fill<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.890> taking<00:00:23.519> my

panel to fill that in well I'm taking my

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
panel to fill that in well I'm taking my
own<00:00:23.760> advice<00:00:24.140> this<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.410> around<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> I've

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
outer rocker panel and I'm just going to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.870 
outer rocker panel and I'm just going to
whittle<00:00:31.109> away<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.650> until<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> nice

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
whittle away at it until I get a nice

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.420 
whittle away at it until I get a nice
fit<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.050> inner<00:00:34.260> rocker<00:00:34.469> panel<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
fit of that inner rocker panel but

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.160 
fit of that inner rocker panel but
remember<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.059> need<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.930> need<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
remember you do need to you need to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.389 
remember you do need to you need to
clamp<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.770> place<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.280> make

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
clamp it in place to see you can make

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
clamp it in place to see you can make
good<00:00:41.579> marks<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.210> good<00:00:42.780> cuts<00:00:43.079> more

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
good marks and good cuts more

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040 
good marks and good cuts more
importantly<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:45.360> cut<00:00:45.570> away<00:00:45.719> too<00:00:45.780> much

importantly and not cut away too much

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
importantly and not cut away too much
material<00:00:46.760> when<00:00:47.760> you're<00:00:47.879> getting<00:00:47.969> ready<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
material when you're getting ready to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
material when you're getting ready to
start<00:00:48.809> cutting<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.829> fit<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.160> inner<00:00:50.489> rocker

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
start cutting to fit your inner rocker

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.400 
start cutting to fit your inner rocker
panel<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.120> place<00:00:51.239> there's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> couple<00:00:51.840> things<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
panel in place there's a couple things I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.650 
panel in place there's a couple things I
wanted<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> point<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.390> these<00:00:54.510> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
wanted to point out there's these little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.040 
wanted to point out there's these little
bulges<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
bulges right here you can see one here I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
bulges right here you can see one here I
just<00:00:58.410> went<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.980> further<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.809> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
just went a little bit further back it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
just went a little bit further back it
might<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.350> difficult<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> see

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
might be a little more difficult to see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.440 
might be a little more difficult to see
but<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.250> tracing<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.940> finger<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
but I'm tracing it with my finger and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.580 
but I'm tracing it with my finger and
pan<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> reference

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
pan out here so you can get a reference

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620 
pan out here so you can get a reference
to<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.909> these

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to where it is it's right here these

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
to where it is it's right here these
little<00:01:09.810> bumps<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> screw

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
little bumps are really going to screw

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.580 
little bumps are really going to screw
you<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.780> when<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.869> trying<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> fit<00:01:13.380> you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you up when you're trying to fit you're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.330 
you up when you're trying to fit you're
in<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.490> rocker<00:01:14.700> panel<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.119> place<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.220> what<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in a rocker panel in place so what you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.440 
in a rocker panel in place so what you
can<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> rocker

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
can do is because you're in a rocker

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.760 
can do is because you're in a rocker
panel<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> extend<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> about

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
panel is going to extend up to about

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
panel is going to extend up to about
here<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.530> cut<00:01:23.299> along

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
here you can go in and just cut along

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.429 
here you can go in and just cut along
the<00:01:24.479> top<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.580> little<00:01:26.580> bumps<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the top of these little bumps to get to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.890 
the top of these little bumps to get to
get<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.710> initial<00:01:28.920> fitment<00:01:29.720> you're<00:01:30.720> still

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
get your initial fitment you're still

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780 
get your initial fitment you're still
going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> cut<00:01:31.470> further<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.670> when

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
going to have to cut further up but when

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.609 
going to have to cut further up but when
you<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:32.970> rid<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.570> bumps<00:01:34.380> here

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you get rid of these little bumps here

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.319 
you get rid of these little bumps here
it<00:01:35.189> helps<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> better<00:01:35.820> fit<00:01:36.150> meant

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it helps you get a better fit meant

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.999 
it helps you get a better fit meant
other<00:01:36.990> panels<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.909> cut<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.150> high

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
other panels so cut a little high

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.270 
other panels so cut a little high
then<00:01:41.210> take<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.390> assembler<00:01:43.290> clamped<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.130> turn

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
then take your assembler clamped in turn

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
then take your assembler clamped in turn
out<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> rocker<00:01:44.670> panel<00:01:45.060> hold<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.960> place

and then Mark where you would need to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
and then Mark where you would need to
cut<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.960> fitting<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> inner<00:01:52.320> rocker<00:01:52.560> panel

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
cut a fitting up the inner rocker panel

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.700 
cut a fitting up the inner rocker panel
you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> got<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.479> material

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
you can see I got a little more material

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
you can see I got a little more material
from<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> floor<00:01:56.040> cut<00:01:56.250> away<00:01:56.960> panned<00:01:57.960> down<00:01:58.049> here

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
from the floor cut away panned down here

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.450 
from the floor cut away panned down here
these<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> pieces<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
these are some of the pieces of that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149 
these are some of the pieces of that
cutout<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.680> mentioned

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
cutout you can see but I just mentioned

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.470 
cutout you can see but I just mentioned
the<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.979> bumps

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
the little bumps

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.080 
the little bumps
that<00:02:07.050> are<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> factory<00:02:07.740> floor<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.820> cut

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that are in the factory floor you cut

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.200 
that are in the factory floor you cut
around<00:02:09.180> those<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.810> those<00:02:09.930> removed<00:02:10.350> and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
around those and get those removed and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.280 
around those and get those removed and
we<00:02:12.210> still<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.570> enough<00:02:12.810> sheet<00:02:12.960> metal<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we still got enough sheet metal there I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.600 
we still got enough sheet metal there I
still<00:02:13.500> got<00:02:13.650> more<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> need<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.340> cut<00:02:14.520> away

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
still got more that I need to cut away

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.990 
still got more that I need to cut away
and<00:02:15.450> I'll<00:02:15.750> show<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.320> second

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and I'll show you that here in a second

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.850 
and I'll show you that here in a second
and<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:18.930> got<00:02:19.110> still

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and you can see here we still got still

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.670 
and you can see here we still got still
need<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.070> make<00:02:20.220> our<00:02:20.340> cut<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.230> floor<00:02:22.410> here

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
need to make our cut on the floor here

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.700 
need to make our cut on the floor here
but<00:02:23.220> I'm<00:02:23.310> doing<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> lot<00:02:23.730> better<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.440> side

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
but I'm doing a lot better on this side

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.220 
but I'm doing a lot better on this side
that<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.920> did<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> driver's<00:02:26.760> side<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.230> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that I did on the driver's side and that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.680 
that I did on the driver's side and that
is<00:02:28.410> because<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> clamped<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.240> panels<00:02:30.450> in

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
is because I clamped the two panels in

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.840 
is because I clamped the two panels in
place<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.020> can't<00:02:31.260> stress<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.560> enough<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.670> get

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
place I can't stress that enough to get

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.310 
place I can't stress that enough to get
these<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:34.320> intern<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> rocker<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.160> fit

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
these the intern out of rocker to fit

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.080 
these the intern out of rocker to fit
as<00:02:37.320> best<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.520> need<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.850> clamped

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
as best you can they need to be clamped

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.710 
as best you can they need to be clamped
in<00:02:39.270> place<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.600> is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
in place and you can see here there is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
in place and you can see here there is
still<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.960> bit<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> gap<00:02:46.550> but<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.820> show<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
still a bit of a gap but I can show you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.410 
still a bit of a gap but I can show you
right<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.300> by<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.410> rocker<00:02:49.620> panel<00:02:50.100> still

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
right here by out of rocker panel still

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.870 
right here by out of rocker panel still
it's<00:02:51.420> actually<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.980> almost<00:02:52.980> perfect<00:02:53.100> position

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
it's actually in almost perfect position

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.730 
it's actually in almost perfect position
right<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:58.230> gap<00:02:58.470> right<00:02:58.680> here

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
right there so this gap right here

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.010 
right there so this gap right here
you'll<00:02:59.100> probably<00:02:59.310> need<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.300> hammer<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
you'll probably need to hammer this

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.140 
you'll probably need to hammer this
inner<00:03:01.290> panel<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.920> little<00:03:02.190> bit<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:04.140> that

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
inner panel in a little bit so that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.990 
inner panel in a little bit so that
seats<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.270> hit<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.100> floor<00:03:08.100> here<00:03:08.370> but

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
seats in hit into the floor here but

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.330 
seats in hit into the floor here but
also<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:10.050> don't<00:03:10.170> want<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.410> suck<00:03:10.620> you're<00:03:10.830> out

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
also you don't want to suck you're out

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.410 
also you don't want to suck you're out
of<00:03:11.550> rocker<00:03:11.880> panel<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.330> too<00:03:12.510> deep<00:03:14.240> there<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:15.330> go

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
of rocker panel in too deep there we go

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.110 
of rocker panel in too deep there we go
we're<00:03:15.570> getting<00:03:15.660> pretty<00:03:15.900> close<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.860> I'll<00:03:17.580> make

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
we're getting pretty close and I'll make

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.170 
we're getting pretty close and I'll make
these<00:03:18.300> cuts<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.190> get<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.340> fitted<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.030> place

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
these cuts and get this fitted in place

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.690 
these cuts and get this fitted in place
and<00:03:21.450> take<00:03:21.930> another<00:03:22.080> video<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:23.520> are<00:03:23.550> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and take another video and here we are I

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.920 
and take another video and here we are I
made<00:03:23.970> my<00:03:24.090> cut<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:25.770> can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.630> but<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
made my cut you can see there but like I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.970 
made my cut you can see there but like I
just<00:03:27.959> mentioned<00:03:28.459> we<00:03:29.459> still<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.980> gap

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
just mentioned we still have that gap

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.970 
just mentioned we still have that gap
problem<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> I'm<00:03:34.230> going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> hammer<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.280> this

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
problem so I'm going to hammer on this

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.080 
problem so I'm going to hammer on this
inner<00:03:37.980> rocker<00:03:38.160> panel<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.610> see<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.850> can't

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
inner rocker panel and see if I can't

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
inner rocker panel and see if I can't
get<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.450> fit<00:03:39.780> up<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> little<00:03:40.110> bit<00:03:40.260> closer

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
get it to fit up a little bit closer

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.550 
get it to fit up a little bit closer
right<00:03:40.830> now<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> gap<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:44.959> roughly<00:03:45.959> quarter

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
right now the gap is roughly quarter

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.190 
right now the gap is roughly quarter
inch<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.040> some<00:03:47.400> areas<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.330> other<00:03:48.510> areas<00:03:48.930> as

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
inch in some areas in other areas as

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.400 
inch in some areas in other areas as
much<00:03:49.410> as<00:03:49.560> 3/8<00:03:50.010> which<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.930> see<00:03:52.200> down<00:03:52.230> at

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
much as 3/8 which you can see down at

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.000 
much as 3/8 which you can see down at
this<00:03:52.709> angle<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.970> cut<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.560> pretty<00:03:55.560> good<00:03:55.770> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
this angle the cut is pretty good I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.860 
this angle the cut is pretty good I
shouldn't<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.850> too<00:03:57.030> much<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.330> fill<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.690> I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
shouldn't have too much to fill up I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.290 
shouldn't have too much to fill up I
don't<00:03:58.739> think<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.040> lot<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.250> make<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> patch<00:04:00.090> panel

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
don't think a lot to make a patch panel

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.260 
don't think a lot to make a patch panel
like<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.570> had<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.830> driver<00:04:02.040> side<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:03.090> I'll

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
like I had to on the driver side so I'll

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.580 
like I had to on the driver side so I'll
get<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.480> hammer<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.380> see<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.530> I

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
get to hammer in on this and see if I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.300 
get to hammer in on this and see if I
can't<00:04:04.830> close<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.860> gap<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.890> little<00:04:08.070> bit

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
can't close in this gap a little bit

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.130 
can't close in this gap a little bit
better<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:09.390> after<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.690> little<00:04:09.930> bit<00:04:10.050> of

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
better and after a little bit of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.330 
better and after a little bit of
hammering<00:04:10.470> we've<00:04:11.459> got<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.910> gap<00:04:12.780> pretty<00:04:13.080> good

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
hammering we've got the gap pretty good

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.060 
hammering we've got the gap pretty good
I<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:15.120> push<00:04:15.329> in<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.079> little<00:04:16.620> bit<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:16.920> get

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
I can push in on it a little bit and get

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.620 
I can push in on it a little bit and get
it<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.280> line<00:04:17.459> up<00:04:17.609> real<00:04:17.850> flush<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.329> don't<00:04:18.480> want

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it to line up real flush you don't want

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.599 
it to line up real flush you don't want
it

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
it

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.240 
it
too<00:04:20.060> much<00:04:20.269> because<00:04:20.509> you<00:04:20.629> do<00:04:20.750> need<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.989> run<00:04:21.250> put

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
too much because you do need to run put

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.029 
too much because you do need to run put
some<00:04:22.430> rosette<00:04:23.389> welds<00:04:23.539> down<00:04:24.169> in<00:04:24.289> here<00:04:24.500> when<00:04:25.009> you

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
some rosette welds down in here when you

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.119 
some rosette welds down in here when you
mount<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.430> out<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.669> rocker<00:04:26.889> otherwise<00:04:27.889> it's

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
mount the out of rocker otherwise it's

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.999 
mount the out of rocker otherwise it's
pretty<00:04:28.310> good<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.699> think<00:04:28.939> I'm<00:04:29.090> going<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.800> go<00:04:30.800> with

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
pretty good I think I'm going to go with

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.749 
pretty good I think I'm going to go with
it<00:04:31.189> as<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:32.120> is<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.740> before<00:04:33.889> I<00:04:34.099> get<00:04:34.189> that<00:04:34.430> welded

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
it as it is but before I get that welded

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.659 
it as it is but before I get that welded
up<00:04:34.849> I'm<00:04:35.060> going<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.530> get<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.680> here<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.930> cut<00:04:38.930> out

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
up I'm going to get in here and cut out

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.540 
up I'm going to get in here and cut out
cut<00:04:40.669> out<00:04:40.819> my<00:04:41.180> original<00:04:41.509> floor<00:04:41.719> and<00:04:42.310> get<00:04:43.310> my<00:04:43.430> new

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
floor panel I've mocked Emily's okay got

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.070 
floor panel I've mocked Emily's okay got
the<00:04:46.879> floor<00:04:47.090> cut<00:04:47.389> out<00:04:47.599> I<00:04:48.080> got<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.830> floor<00:04:49.039> glaces

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
the floor cut out I got the floor glaces

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.450 
the floor cut out I got the floor glaces
ground<00:04:51.080> smooth<00:04:51.469> and<00:04:51.770> put<00:04:51.919> some<00:04:52.039> weld<00:04:52.250> through

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
ground smooth and put some weld through

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.839 
ground smooth and put some weld through
primer<00:04:52.490> on<00:04:53.029> them<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:55.250> as<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.610> see<00:04:55.669> I

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
primer on them and as you can see I

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.209 
primer on them and as you can see I
didn't<00:04:56.240> cut<00:04:56.419> out<00:04:56.710> nearly<00:04:57.710> as<00:04:57.800> much<00:04:57.949> of<00:04:58.009> the

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
didn't cut out nearly as much of the

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.399 
didn't cut out nearly as much of the
floor<00:04:58.490> as<00:04:58.909> I<00:04:59.689> did<00:04:59.870> on<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.020> driver's<00:05:00.379> side

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
floor as I did on the driver's side

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.890 
floor as I did on the driver's side
mainly<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:00.919> because<00:05:01.069> I<00:05:01.219> didn't<00:05:01.460> need<00:05:01.520> to

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
mainly just because I didn't need to

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.529 
mainly just because I didn't need to
which<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.050> good<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.229> don't<00:05:03.500> have<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.770> deal<00:05:03.949> with

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
which is good I don't have to deal with

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.390 
which is good I don't have to deal with
that<00:05:05.539> corner<00:05:06.050> which<00:05:06.620> was<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.800> pain<00:05:07.009> in<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.189> butt

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.929 
got a little fat I cut out a little too
much<00:05:57.620> just<00:05:57.949> like<00:05:58.099> I<00:05:58.189> did<00:05:58.339> on<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.520> other<00:05:58.580> side

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
much just like I did on the other side

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.519 
much just like I did on the other side
but<00:05:59.319> this<00:06:00.319> sides<00:06:00.620> much<00:06:00.889> better

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
but this sides much better

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.769 
but this sides much better
honestly<00:06:03.529> it's<00:06:03.740> borderline<00:06:04.099> if<00:06:04.939> you<00:06:05.539> wanted

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
honestly it's borderline if you wanted

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.589 
honestly it's borderline if you wanted
to<00:06:05.930> just<00:06:06.589> fill<00:06:06.860> it<00:06:07.009> in<00:06:07.099> with<00:06:07.129> weld<00:06:07.550> just<00:06:08.449> do<00:06:08.569> a

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
to just fill it in with weld just do a

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.320 
to just fill it in with weld just do a
tack<00:06:09.379> up<00:06:09.589> top<00:06:09.860> tack<00:06:10.250> on<00:06:10.460> bottom<00:06:10.849> and<00:06:11.000> just<00:06:11.150> kind

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
tack up top tack on bottom and just kind

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.409 
tack up top tack on bottom and just kind
of<00:06:12.310> slowly<00:06:13.310> join<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:13.759> two<00:06:13.909> pieces<00:06:14.120> together

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
of slowly join the two pieces together

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.909 
of slowly join the two pieces together
that'll<00:06:14.900> be<00:06:14.990> fine<00:06:15.169> that's<00:06:15.349> what<00:06:15.560> I'm<00:06:15.650> going<00:06:15.830> to
