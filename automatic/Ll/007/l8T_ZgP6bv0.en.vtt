00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.529
 another very valuable product 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.840
 the coconut coconut milk and cookies 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.759
 mail has a few special features like that 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.470
 name already says can be used as a mail for 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.779
 some in the kitchen can be a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 Baking recipe may be 20 percent of 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.529
 Mehls replaced by cookies more that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.720
 he is valuable but can also do it 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.880
 in raw form take us for it when I am 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.200
 equal to a very tasty variation of the 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.620
 to prepare the audience 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.260
 with healthy raw food cocoa and cocos 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.870
 mail as an essential ingredient cocos mail 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.610
 contains 40 percent fiber now good 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.050
 keep many foods 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.450
 Fiber which is very important 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.280
 but crucial for our intestinal flora 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.730
 Point is a ko kossmehl we have next 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.840
 the usual cellulose is the main proportion 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 of fiber normally 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 represents also the fruit 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.320
 oligosaccharides that his special kind 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.600
 of carbohydrates which are the positive ones 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.729
 encourage bacteria in our intestine liu 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.070
 they are food for the and that 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.380
 is partly more important than just 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.270
 cleanse this old idea fiber 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.040
 the bowel or you just need it as 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.820
 mass for digestion 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 that is not wrong but what I am 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.570
 iaa showed is just 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.220
 fiber in the form of cellulose too 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.840
 to take one does not lead to it yet 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 that the intestinal flora improves 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 we need the right one for this 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.350
 nutrient medium for our intestinal bacteria and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.330
 there are oligosaccharides just added 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.799
 especially recommended to have 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.600
 while that is for high fiber 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.580
 food rarely 20 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.880
 percent high-quality protein and coconut 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.490
 more 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.760
 So we can do it at the same time 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.590
 to use something that cleanses our bowels 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.320
 rehabilitate the healthy intestinal flora promote 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.060
 and what we vegetable high quality 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.150
 Protein provides such a combination 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.770
 one has these two special defects 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.850
 extremely rare in nature 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.590
 In this respect disco kossmehl 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 probably even unique among them 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.510
 the food as a very 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.099
 delicious version of the lector of us 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.310
 now can take cocos munitions 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.530
 I recommend to use a cocoa 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.270
 we 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.340
 more water than the other recipes 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 of the audience because now here no 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.360
 fruits use the water supply 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.740
 would 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 then we take cocos mail and the 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.280
 As you can of course amounts here 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 vary arbitrarily if I correct 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.470
 I would like to get full 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.470
 a little more pure 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.680
 then we have a good raw food here 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.930
 cacau a mixture of cocoa marca lupu 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.050
 makarov some other ingredients yet 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.510
 are included a really nice 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.270
 I give creamy consistency 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.780
 always something coconut oil to do it 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.040
 all beautifully creamy creamy and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.170
 Of course, it adds to the good effects 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.460
 the cocoon now mails when I am now 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.860
 a bit of fluid through the 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.010
 temperature now in the summertime can 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.230
 sometimes pour it and then as 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.380
 sweetener namely coconut blossoms 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.840
 sugar very good sweetener one 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.380
 good luck chemical index of about 35 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.130
 what next to the sweet just the same 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.990
 valuable vital substances nectar it 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.240
 contains the nectar of a plant that is 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.460
 yes always very high quality food should 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 the insects attract the plants 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.010
 pollinate and very concentrated 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.080
 secondary to raw material trace elements 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.640
 plant active ingredients that is already enough 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.000
 as ingredients and you could now 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.640
 Cardamom cinnamon different spices 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.320
 Add this art if you like it though 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.730
 In essence, it should be in these 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
 I want to stay here now 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 In this case fruits do not recommend 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.030
 that would be very good 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.740
 high fiber and protein content of the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.300
 Kokons do not do mails that well 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.670
 So here we have just this 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.690
 version of the kag also the essential 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.690
 tastier is 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.310
 we see something here now 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.750
 thick liquid consistency what i like 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.760
 personally likes but of course can 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.050
 one with the water content and the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.910
 proportions of the other ingredients 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.770
 vary as you like it you can 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.570
 make a pudding with it 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 very little water or just one 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.650
 viscous or thin liquid 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.290
 drink and then a very 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.730
 satisfying very satisfying little ones 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.430
 snack due to 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.560
 fiber content and the protein and 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.970
 the low glycemic index is from 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.830
 cocos flowers sugar it is also something 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.020
 what gives us energy but the blood sugar 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.180
 stabilizes so that we have longer 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.950
 time to be well supplied with energy 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.260
 then we rented one and that 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.810
 magnesium is the polyphenols of cocoa 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.000
 a very good synergy represents to the 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.860
 Cinema go effects of coconut oil 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.840
 protein content the flight theologian thing 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.780
 ried content of the cocoon mails so one 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.070
 Very complete style of our body 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.070
 to provide high-quality food
