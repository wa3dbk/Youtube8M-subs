00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.790
 or not 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.790
 welcome one more day to my jingle today 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.080
 we talked about sensor sizes and how 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.080
 affects this to our image 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.150
 I 'm not flat you'll have a day 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 but 5150 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.280
 look that it is not coÃ±a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.070
 but once 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.430
 what do you think 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 but it looks smaller but that was not 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.410
 my fucking plane 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.420
 there is the same place as you 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.290
 I think I was 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.370
 this goal is wrong 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.370
 this here does not work 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.710
 let's start talking about the two 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.770
 most known sensors the psc and the full 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.930
 frame has never been tested by the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 another friend's camera with the same 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.850
 objective that the image looks slightly 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.550
 larger in one camera than with another 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 Although the goal is the same 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 this happens because of the difference in three 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.270
 sensors the sensors to psc are usually 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.700
 the most common since its price is not 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.940
 as high as the full frame the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.740
 Size of the pf is 22 x 15 millimeters 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 while the size of the full frame is 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.780
 of 36 x 24 all the objectives come 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.880
 with a focal range that is proper to the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 optics like for example 50 millimeters 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.800
 18 this goal in a full camera 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.590
 frame is still a 50 millimeter but 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.020
 if we put it in a 550 that has a 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.660
 sensor to the psc would come to be 180 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.789
 millimeters why does this happen the factor 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.239
 of clipping between these two sensors is 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.100
 of 16 since the focus of almost all 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.380
 objectives refers to the full 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 frame so if we use a 35 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.209
 millimeters in our 550 we would have to 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.990
 multiply it by 16 to see what focal 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.690
 would give us 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.590
 with this camera 35 x 1 with 6 equals 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.019
 56 millimeters 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 but do not worry because the 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.080
 goals that do not also have two 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.970
 versions the f and the one that fs the one of f is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.190
 designed for full frame cameras but 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 It can also be used in cameras 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.410
 sensor to psc you can differentiate the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.060
 rest for a little red dot the fs are 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.120
 designed for cameras with a sensor 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.709
 psc and its focal range is the one of this type 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.629
 of cameras so we could not use 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.890
 the objectives with full frame cameras are 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.890
 difference by a white dot 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.910
 because the size of the sensor from 550 to 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.280
 have the smallest sensor what 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.110
 capture is the center of the lens this 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 has its advantages because when using the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.330
 center of optics we have less 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.040
 aberrations and optical distortions 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.470
 while the blue frame uses all 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.420
 the optics a 35 mm is still 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.310
 a 35 millimeter plus these cameras 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.750
 they have the largest pixels what 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.420
 allows to work in better conditions 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.420
 with high floor giving a lower noise 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.450
 and this has been all for today we continue in 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.280
 our facebook of making cut in 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.330
 our twitter or our channel 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.830
 Youtube 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.830
 this is to verify 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.690
 the goal is wrong 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.090
 then when they were made
