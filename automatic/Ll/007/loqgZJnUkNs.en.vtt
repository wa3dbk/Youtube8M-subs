00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
than Calvin Johnson right now so you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.980 
than Calvin Johnson right now so you
know<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.970> my<00:02:36.120> whole<00:02:36.390> movement<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
know this is just my whole movement to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.760 
know this is just my whole movement to
prove<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> liberals<00:02:37.860> don't<00:02:37.950> matter<00:02:38.280> um<00:02:39.770> it's

prove that liberals don't matter um it's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.490 
prove that liberals don't matter um it's
it's<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.340> something<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.050> mechanics

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's it's something that the mechanics

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.710 
it's it's something that the mechanics
of<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.830> game<00:02:44.000> you're<00:02:45.000> gonna<00:02:45.150> drop<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> ball

that's the last thing I have is a warp

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.140 
that's the last thing I have is a warp

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
tackle to rely on and EA won't even give

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.260 
tackle to rely on and EA won't even give
me<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.530> Lap<00:02:55.830> Kok<00:02:56.310> elicit<00:02:57.180> an
