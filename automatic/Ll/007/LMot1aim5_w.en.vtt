freshwater tank here you can see the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.420 
freshwater tank here you can see the
autofill<00:00:23.519> mechanism<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.900> over<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> front

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
autofill mechanism and over on the front

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
autofill mechanism and over on the front
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> machine<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.619> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
of the machine right here this is your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.200 
of the machine right here this is your
Dwyer<00:00:29.550> busy<00:00:30.060> flow<00:00:30.240> meter<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.650> works

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
Dwyer busy flow meter this only works

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
Dwyer busy flow meter this only works
when<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.630> machine<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.020> filling<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
when the machine is filling so you can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.090 
when the machine is filling so you can
only<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.870> you're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.950> be

in here and hook it to the sink
and<00:00:52.649> there's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> connection<00:00:53.250> pose<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and there's a connection pose in the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
and there's a connection pose in the
back<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.719> turn<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> around<00:00:57.469> for<00:00:58.469> your

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
back here and turn it around for your

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
back here and turn it around for your
auto<00:00:59.039> fill<00:00:59.370> hose<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.270> here

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
auto fill hose is going to go in here

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
auto fill hose is going to go in here
and<00:01:00.960> you're<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.559> gonna<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> turn

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and you're actually gonna have to turn

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.939 
and you're actually gonna have to turn
on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> hot<00:01:02.640> water<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.470> that's<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.680> meet

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
on the hot water and that's gonna meet

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.520 
on the hot water and that's gonna meet
her<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> turn<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.390> knob

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530 

counterclockwise<00:01:10.939> you'll<00:01:11.939> actually<00:01:12.119> see

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
counterclockwise you'll actually see

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850 
counterclockwise you'll actually see
there's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:12.869> float<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.560> that'll

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
there's a little float in here that'll

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
there's a little float in here that'll
come<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.970> tells<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.360> how<00:01:15.570> many

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
come up and it tells you how many

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
come up and it tells you how many
gallons<00:01:16.380> per<00:01:16.830> hour<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.520> meters<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
gallons per hour at meters into the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.320 
gallons per hour at meters into the
machine<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.590> filling<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:21.000> entire

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
machine if it was filling for an entire

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
machine if it was filling for an entire
hour<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> meter<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.890> 4<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.850> means

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
hour and the meter was at 4 that means

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
hour and the meter was at 4 that means
it's<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> inject<00:01:24.900> 4<00:01:25.259> gallons<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it's going to inject 4 gallons of this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's going to inject 4 gallons of this
product<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.360> naturally<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.439> not

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
product into here naturally it's not

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.719 
product into here naturally it's not
going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> fill

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
going to do that it's just going to fill

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
going to do that it's just going to fill
it<00:01:29.850> first<00:01:30.000> short<00:01:30.299> while<00:01:31.340> also<00:01:33.380> when<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> get

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it first short while also when you get

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
it first short while also when you get
the<00:01:34.710> unit<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.610> nylon<00:01:36.180> sock<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> be

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the unit the nylon sock is going to be

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
the unit the nylon sock is going to be
on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.860> inside<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> make<00:01:40.259> sure
