that does that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.040 
that does that
nor<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.179> direction<00:00:30.869> it's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
nor is it it's not that direction it's

obviously<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.099> direction<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.640> believe<00:00:33.320> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
obviously this direction I believe it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.130 
obviously this direction I believe it's
pretty<00:00:34.559> nice<00:00:34.710> seed<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.600> just<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.690> grassland

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
pretty nice seed it's just a grassland

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.530 
pretty nice seed it's just a grassland
type<00:00:37.410> area<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.520> ravine<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.940> doesn't

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
type area about ravine that doesn't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.970 
type area about ravine that doesn't
really<00:00:39.660> lead<00:00:39.899> anywhere<00:00:40.200> maybe<00:00:40.500> unless<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
really lead anywhere maybe unless you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
really lead anywhere maybe unless you
dig<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> were<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> drop<00:00:42.719> down

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
dig over like if you were to drop down

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
dig over like if you were to drop down
there<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> dig<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> right

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
there and dig to the left or the right

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.260 
there and dig to the left or the right
or<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.610> further<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.149> might

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
or a little bit further down you might

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.930 
or a little bit further down you might
come<00:00:45.480> across<00:00:45.570> something<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> main

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
come across something but the main

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
come across something but the main
feature<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> small<00:00:49.350> flat<00:00:50.190> area<00:00:50.460> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the people who want though location the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
the people who want though location the
x-coordinate<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.439> 169<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.040> y-coordinate<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
x-coordinate is 169 the y-coordinate is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.010 
x-coordinate is 169 the y-coordinate is
69<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> z-coordinate<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.619> 97<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.630> ravine

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
69 and the z-coordinate is 97 the ravine

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.910 
69 and the z-coordinate is 97 the ravine
it<00:01:31.259> should<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.590> pretty<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.070> right<00:01:33.920> within

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it should be pretty much right within

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.580 
it should be pretty much right within
view<00:01:35.130> distance<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> actual<00:01:36.390> spawn<00:01:37.049> location

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
view distance the actual spawn location

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
view distance the actual spawn location
if<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> sum<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.430> softly<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> backed

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
if I sum it softly it's because I backed

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.210 
if I sum it softly it's because I backed
a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.810> too<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.140> away<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> mic<00:01:40.650> so

be doing more minecraft seeds if
everything<00:01:58.380> works<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.950> should<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.490> just

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
everything works out this should be just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.010 
everything works out this should be just
fine<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.240> recording<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:02.630> basically<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.869> for

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
fine for recording so basically it for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.819 
fine for recording so basically it for
that<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:05.119> came<00:02:06.119> across<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.450> variety<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.990> problems

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that I came across a variety of problems

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.340 
that I came across a variety of problems
over<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> course<00:02:08.759> since<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.179> been

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
over the course since I've been

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.780 
over the course since I've been
doing<00:02:11.350> minecraft<00:02:11.770> seeds<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> first

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
doing minecraft seeds like the first

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.630 
doing minecraft seeds like the first
time<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.060> think<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.770> my<00:02:14.770> power<00:02:14.950> supply<00:02:15.340> unit

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
