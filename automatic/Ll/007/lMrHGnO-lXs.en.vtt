00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
a let's be realistic about it I've

a let's be realistic about it I've
already<00:00:10.980> shown<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.519> level<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.910> garrison

you can find that on my channel and

you can find that on my channel and

Ridge when the Alpha and then

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.420 
Ridge when the Alpha and then
subsequently<00:00:19.170> beta<00:00:19.529> first<00:00:19.830> came<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.279> they

subsequently beta first came up they

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300

were<00:00:20.939> showing<00:00:21.330> us<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.050> level<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.859> hoard

were showing us the level to hoard
garrison<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.660> meant<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.199> was

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
garrison and that meant that it was

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.920 
garrison and that meant that it was
really<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.340> was<00:00:26.400> rather<00:00:26.699> large<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.449> spread

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
really it was rather large and spread

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.950 
really it was rather large and spread
out<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:29.369> sparse<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> lot<00:00:30.539> led<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
out and very sparse and a lot led to a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
out and very sparse and a lot led to a
lot<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> seemingly<00:00:31.830> negative<00:00:32.489> player

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
lot of seemingly negative player

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.040 
lot of seemingly negative player
feedback<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.360> people<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.719> thought<00:00:33.930> oh

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
feedback because people just thought oh

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
feedback because people just thought oh
wow<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:34.710> crappy<00:00:34.980> shitty<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.640> camp

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
wow it's some crappy shitty little camp

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
wow it's some crappy shitty little camp
well<00:00:36.660> honestly<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.320> were<00:00:37.410> looking<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
well honestly you were looking at a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
well honestly you were looking at a
place<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.280> designed<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.059> eight

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
place that was designed for like eight

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
place that was designed for like eight
or<00:00:39.300> nine<00:00:39.450> buildings<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.710> only<00:00:40.920> had<00:00:41.250> about

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
or nine buildings that only had about

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
or nine buildings that only had about
three<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:42.719> probably<00:00:42.989> why<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
three in it so that's probably why it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
three in it so that's probably why it
looked<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.129> disappointing<00:00:44.989> now

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
looked a little bit disappointing now

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.260 
looked a little bit disappointing now
this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> level<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.010> variant<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.059> got

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this is the level one variant it's got

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
this is the level one variant it's got
room<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.690> three<00:00:48.840> plots<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.590> believe<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
room for three plots I believe and I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
room for three plots I believe and I
haven't<00:00:50.879> done<00:00:50.940> any<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> quest<00:00:51.449> yet<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
haven't done any the quest yet this is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.029 
haven't done any the quest yet this is
just<00:00:52.020> me<00:00:52.140> rolling<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> fresh

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
just me rolling in here in a fresh

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
just me rolling in here in a fresh
character<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.910> guys<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> crack<00:00:54.600> when

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
character you guys know the crack when

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
character you guys know the crack when
it<00:00:54.899> comes<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.770> honest<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it comes to this let's be honest and so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
it comes to this let's be honest and so
yeah<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.890> essentially<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> same<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
yeah it's essentially the same in that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
yeah it's essentially the same in that
you<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.270> sort<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.260> border

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you have this sort of you know border

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.210 
you have this sort of you know border
wall<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.120> fine<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.979> just<00:01:04.979> like

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
wall going on that's fine and just like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
wall going on that's fine and just like
the<00:01:05.460> Alliance<00:01:05.820> place<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> border<00:01:06.450> wall<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the Alliance place the border wall is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
the Alliance place the border wall is
just<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> palisade<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.180> like

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
just the palisade you know it's not like

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
just the palisade you know it's not like
a<00:01:09.450> large<00:01:10.380> wall<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.920> could<00:01:11.100> put<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> few

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a large wall that you could put a few

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
a large wall that you could put a few
guys<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.909> top<00:01:12.060> off<00:01:12.299> no<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.799> it's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
guys on top off no it's it's not it's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920 
guys on top off no it's it's not it's
just<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> palisade<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> few<00:01:15.330> guard<00:01:15.540> towers

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just a palisade with a few guard towers

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
just a palisade with a few guard towers
spread<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.920> place<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
spread around the place and for the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
spread around the place and for the
level<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.060> garrison<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> makes

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
level one garrison I think that makes

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.710 
level one garrison I think that makes
absolute<00:01:19.560> sense<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.060> believe<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> policy<00:01:21.540> gets

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
absolute sense I believe the policy gets

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
absolute sense I believe the policy gets
larger<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> level<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.710> garrison<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
larger for the level to garrison and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
larger for the level to garrison and
then<00:01:23.729> probably<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.509> level<00:01:24.750> 31<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
then probably the level 31 would be a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
then probably the level 31 would be a
full-on<00:01:25.770> wall<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.490> watchtowers<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
full-on wall with watchtowers and you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899 
full-on wall with watchtowers and you
know<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.290> ignore<00:01:28.560> deterring<00:01:28.890> style<00:01:29.280> castle

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
know can ignore deterring style castle

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
know can ignore deterring style castle
style<00:01:30.180> stuff<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> definitely<00:01:31.740> smaller

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
style stuff this is definitely smaller

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710 
style stuff this is definitely smaller
though<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> sort<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
though and actually I think it sort of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
though and actually I think it sort of
benefits<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> smaller<00:01:34.860> size<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.460> feels

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
benefits from the smaller size it feels

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
benefits from the smaller size it feels
really<00:01:36.119> cozy<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.680> out

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
really cozy actually you know you're out

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
really cozy actually you know you're out
in<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:37.979> harsh<00:01:38.369> wasteland<00:01:39.210> edge<00:01:39.420> style<00:01:39.780> place

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
in this harsh wasteland edge style place

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.249 
in this harsh wasteland edge style place
and<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.509> into<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.810> sort<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and and then you go into your sort of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
and and then you go into your sort of
compact<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.040> busy<00:01:44.490> bustling<00:01:44.909> am<00:01:45.810> garrison<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
compact but busy bustling am garrison I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.749 
compact but busy bustling am garrison I
just<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.460> rather

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
just think that is really rather

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
just think that is really rather
effective<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.259> course<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> all

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
effective now you can of course see all

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
effective now you can of course see all
the<00:01:50.070> different<00:01:50.159> areas<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.850> expansion<00:01:51.450> when

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the different areas for expansion when

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
the different areas for expansion when
we<00:01:51.750> run<00:01:51.930> around<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:52.799> still

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
we run around here because we're still

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.170 
we run around here because we're still
in<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:54.000> sort<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.140> mini<00:01:55.409> zone<00:01:55.740> here

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
in this sort of little mini zone here

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
in this sort of little mini zone here
you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.420> garrison<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.960> expand<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you know our garrison can expand it to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
you know our garrison can expand it to
all<00:01:58.590> these<00:01:58.770> places<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.729> final<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.180> could

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
all these places so the final one could

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.880 
all these places so the final one could
be<00:02:00.479> three<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:00.780> four<00:02:00.930> times<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> size<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
be three or four times the size of this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
be three or four times the size of this
which<00:02:02.430> i<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> great<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.960> size

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
which i think is great and that size

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
which i think is great and that size
progression<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> help<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
progression really is going to help the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.419 
progression really is going to help the
game<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:06.060> quite<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> lot<00:02:06.979> some<00:02:07.979> reason<00:02:08.220> music

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
game out quite a lot some reason music

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.820 
game out quite a lot some reason music

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
isn't playing hmm well don't have to add

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.070

that back in and post anyway so yeah

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
that back in and post anyway so yeah
it's<00:02:13.319> really

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's really

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's really
essentially<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> TLDR<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.500> has

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
essentially is the the TLDR now this has

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680 
essentially is the the TLDR now this has
space<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.010> your<00:02:17.550> town<00:02:17.760> hall<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.240> then<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
space for your town hall and then I

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.200 
space for your town hall and then I
believe<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.620> medium<00:02:20.130> building<00:02:20.460> no<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> large

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
believe a medium building no a large

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.890 
believe a medium building no a large
building<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.350> small<00:02:23.040> building<00:02:23.720> maybe<00:02:24.720> this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
building and a small building maybe this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.240 
building and a small building maybe this
medium<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.070> put<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
medium but I know that you put a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.410 
medium but I know that you put a
barracks<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.820> these<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.240> they're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
barracks in one of these and they're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
barracks in one of these and they're
like<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> professional<00:02:27.990> building<00:02:28.440> because<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
like a professional building because the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.810 
like a professional building because the
professional<00:02:29.100> buildings<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.610> small

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
professional buildings are the small

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.880 
professional buildings are the small
buildings<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.290> small<00:02:31.530> plots

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
buildings you know for the small plots

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.670 
buildings you know for the small plots
here's<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.670> mine<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.990> actually<00:02:34.200> am

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
here's the mine we have not actually am

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.370 
here's the mine we have not actually am
unlocked<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.460> yet<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:35.910> that's<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.140> thing

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
unlocked that yet so that's the thing

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
unlocked that yet so that's the thing
and<00:02:37.590> here's<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.370> fishing<00:02:38.940> area<00:02:39.210> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and here's this little fishing area that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.090 
and here's this little fishing area that
I<00:02:39.390> showed<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.960> last<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.860> course

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
I showed you the last time of course

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.440 
I showed you the last time of course
there's<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.700> bit<00:02:41.820> less<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.210> here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there's now a little bit less in here

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.180 
there's now a little bit less in here
but<00:02:42.960> still<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> think<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:43.770> really

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
but still I think it's actually really

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.410 
but still I think it's actually really
cool<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.610> know<00:02:44.640> i<00:02:44.730> love<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> fact<00:02:45.300> that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
cool you know i love the fact that
you've<00:02:45.600> got<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.900> hot<00:02:46.080> spring<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.700> honestly

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
you've got this hot spring and honestly

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.840 
you've got this hot spring and honestly
you<00:02:48.380> know<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.500> terms<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.610> having<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850

nice place to chill out in I think the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.960 
nice place to chill out in I think the
Horde<00:02:52.830> garrison<00:02:53.280> might<00:02:53.430> be<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> bit<00:02:53.790> better

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
Horde garrison might be a bit better

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.210 
Horde garrison might be a bit better

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.990 
you see that level to garrison again
that<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.470> previously<00:03:37.650> showed<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.670> will<00:03:38.940> be

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
that I previously showed you it will be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.090 
that I previously showed you it will be
full<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.780> buildings<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:40.470> opposed<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.980> this

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
full of buildings as opposed to this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.760 
full of buildings as opposed to this
which<00:03:41.489> really<00:03:41.820> yeah<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:42.930> supposed<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> know

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
which really yeah or I supposed to know

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.050 
which really yeah or I supposed to know
the<00:03:43.920> previous<00:03:44.250> version<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:44.700> all<00:03:44.790> saw

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the previous version that we all saw

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.750 
the previous version that we all saw
which<00:03:45.570> was<00:03:45.780> rather<00:03:45.959> sparse<00:03:46.470> looking<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.040> I'm

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
which was rather sparse looking and I'm

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430 
which was rather sparse looking and I'm
really<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> main<00:03:48.300> complaint<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.930> saw<00:03:49.200> was

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
really the main complaint that I saw was

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.570 
really the main complaint that I saw was
that<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.709> was<00:03:49.800> sparse<00:03:50.130> on<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> main

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
that it was sparse on the main

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.160 
that it was sparse on the main
compliment<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.300> saw<00:03:51.510> him<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.750> Alliance

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
compliment that I saw him the Alliance

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.650 
compliment that I saw him the Alliance
garrison<00:03:52.650> video<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.910> felt<00:03:54.239> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
garrison video is that it felt and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.770 
garrison video is that it felt and
bustling<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.820> compact<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.239> know<00:03:57.330> busy

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
bustling and compact and you know busy

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.930 
bustling and compact and you know busy
so<00:03:58.380> this<00:03:58.680> should<00:03:58.860> really<00:03:59.040> fix<00:03:59.640> up<00:03:59.910> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
so this should really fix up that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.060 
so this should really fix up that
problem<00:04:00.510> now<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.900> haven't<00:04:01.140> actually<00:04:01.350> got<00:04:01.800> my

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
problem now I haven't actually got my

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.250 
problem now I haven't actually got my
barracks<00:04:02.459> inside<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.030> yet<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:03.300> here's<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
barracks inside this yet so here's the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.810 
barracks inside this yet so here's the
actual<00:04:04.410> location<00:04:05.040> where<00:04:05.190> your<00:04:05.310> barracks<00:04:05.640> will

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
actual location where your barracks will

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.390 
actual location where your barracks will
be<00:04:05.940> built<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.989> believe<00:04:07.350> just<00:04:08.160> wear<00:04:08.340> these

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
be built and I believe just wear these

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220 
be built and I believe just wear these
peons<00:04:08.790> are<00:04:09.030> working<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.630> then<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.050> have

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
peons are working and then you have

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.620 
peons are working and then you have
another<00:04:10.260> slot<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.130> think<00:04:11.550> yeah<00:04:12.000> it's<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.360> one

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
another slot I think yeah it's this one

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.770 
another slot I think yeah it's this one
here<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.890> can<00:04:14.070> put<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.970> say<00:04:15.209> alchemy<00:04:15.660> lab

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
here and you can put a say alchemy lab

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.210 
here and you can put a say alchemy lab
or<00:04:16.019> just<00:04:16.140> any<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.380> those<00:04:16.440> smaller<00:04:16.739> profession
