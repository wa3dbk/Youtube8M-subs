Kryptonian<00:03:09.830> tech<00:03:10.070> we've<00:03:10.310> actually<00:03:10.490> heard

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
Kryptonian tech we've actually heard

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.180 
Kryptonian tech we've actually heard
this<00:03:11.090> before<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.320> think<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.770> this<00:03:12.920> might

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
this before and we think that this might

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.660 
this before and we think that this might
be<00:03:13.220> where<00:03:13.790> maybe<00:03:14.030> doomsday<00:03:14.690> comes<00:03:15.080> from

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
be where maybe doomsday comes from

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.920 
be where maybe doomsday comes from
that's<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:17.060> guess<00:03:17.300> because<00:03:17.510> he's<00:03:17.720> playing

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that's my guess because he's playing

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.690 
that's my guess because he's playing
with<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.170> DNA<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.890> all<00:03:18.980> sorts<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.580> stuff

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
with like DNA and all sorts of stuff

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.650 
with like DNA and all sorts of stuff
like<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.269> already<00:03:23.390> kind

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
like that so I like that we already kind

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.220 
like that so I like that we already kind
