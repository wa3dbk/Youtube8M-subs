really<00:00:26.310> close<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
really close and then they kind of go a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.470 
really close and then they kind of go a
little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.470> downhill<00:00:28.980> from<00:00:29.250> there<00:00:29.550> it's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
little bit downhill from there it's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.030 
little bit downhill from there it's
almost<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.140> trying<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.619> fix

first<00:00:34.200> attempt<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.520> first<00:00:35.730> attempt

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
first attempt but on your first attempt

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.049 
first attempt but on your first attempt
I<00:00:36.239> think<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.780> needed<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> commit

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I think you just needed to just a commit

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
I think you just needed to just a commit
a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.390> harder<00:00:39.960> honestly<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:41.579> check

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
a little harder honestly but let's check

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.130 
a little harder honestly but let's check
out<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.050> slo-mo<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.850> foot<00:00:45.120> flicks<00:00:45.690> off

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
out that slo-mo so your foot flicks off

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.190 
out that slo-mo so your foot flicks off
boom<00:00:47.000> your<00:00:48.000> front<00:00:48.450> foot<00:00:48.629> lands<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.079> there

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
boom your front foot lands in there

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.130 
boom your front foot lands in there
perfectly<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.460> foot<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
perfectly and then your back foot just

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.299 
perfectly and then your back foot just
could<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.170> landed<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> board<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
could have landed on the board but you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360 
could have landed on the board but you
just<00:00:53.579> stepped<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.329> looks<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.989> me<00:00:55.370> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to practice just a little bit like I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
to practice just a little bit like I
said<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.710> down

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
said I think you do have this down

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.460 
said I think you do have this down
pretty<00:01:32.340> well<00:01:32.479> but<00:01:33.479> stand<00:01:33.750> selling<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.259> board

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
pretty well but stand selling your board

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.399 
pretty well but stand selling your board
and<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.770> practice<00:01:35.210> flicking<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.659> heel<00:01:37.110> off

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and just practice flicking your heel off

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
and just practice flicking your heel off
of<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.840> left<00:01:39.840> edge<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.820> think

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of that top left edge there and I think

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
of that top left edge there and I think
just<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> motion<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:43.049> help<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
just that motion will help you out a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.969 
just that motion will help you out a
quite<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> bit<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.600> yeah<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> work

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
quite a bit and then yeah we got to work

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.310 
quite a bit and then yeah we got to work
on<00:01:47.189> getting<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.540> back<00:01:48.840> foot<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
on getting that that back foot on the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.039 
on getting that that back foot on the
board<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> first<00:01:51.329> attempt<00:01:51.960> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
board so on that first attempt I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.920 
board so on that first attempt I
honestly<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.700> needed<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.450> commit

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.410 
honestly think you just needed to commit
because<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.040> close<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.790> you're<00:01:57.090> both

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
because you're so close and you're both

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
because you're so close and you're both
of<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.719> feet<00:01:57.960> were<00:01:58.110> above<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.680> board<00:01:58.950> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of your feet were above the board but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.660 
of your feet were above the board but
then<00:01:59.790> your<00:01:59.939> back<00:02:00.090> foot<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.450> didn't<00:02:00.960> step<00:02:01.229> on

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
then your back foot just didn't step on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.980 
then your back foot just didn't step on
one<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> things<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.270> recommend<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
one of the things I recommend for that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.520 
one of the things I recommend for that
is<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:05.030> practicing<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.380> stepping<00:02:07.380> off

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
is just practicing with stepping off

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
is just practicing with stepping off
with<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.860> back<00:02:08.039> foot<00:02:08.310> over<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.090> over<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
with your back foot over and over and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.059 
with your back foot over and over and
over<00:02:09.509> until<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.709> flip

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
over until you really have that flip

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.090 
over until you really have that flip
down<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.700> then

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
down and then

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.830 
down and then
practice<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.790> was<00:02:13.970> stepping<00:02:14.210> off<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:14.690> your

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
practice it was stepping off with your

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.870 
practice it was stepping off with your
front<00:02:15.110> foot<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:16.130> putting<00:02:16.370> your<00:02:16.580> back

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
front foot and just putting your back

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.240 
front foot and just putting your back
foot<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.510> because<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:18.590> your<00:02:18.710> back<00:02:18.890> foot<00:02:19.130> is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
foot on because if your back foot is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.160 
foot on because if your back foot is
continually<00:02:19.910> kind<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.270> trying<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> step<00:02:20.990> off

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
continually kind of trying to step off

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.050 
continually kind of trying to step off
the<00:02:21.200> board<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.580> remedy<00:02:22.970> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the board you have to remedy that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.560 
the board you have to remedy that
somehow<00:02:23.740> usually<00:02:24.740> if<00:02:25.070> your<00:02:25.670> feet<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.210> your

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
somehow usually if your feet if your

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.360 
somehow usually if your feet if your
feet<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.290> stepping<00:02:27.680> off<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.100> kind

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
feet are kind of stepping off it's kind

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 
feet are kind of stepping off it's kind
of<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.790> more<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.900> mental<00:02:30.320> thing<00:02:30.350> than<00:02:30.830> an

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
of a more of a mental thing than an

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
of a more of a mental thing than an
actual<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.700> physical<00:02:32.600> practice<00:02:33.200> thing

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
actual like physical practice thing

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.340 
actual like physical practice thing
which<00:02:34.220> means<00:02:34.660> mentally<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.020> need<00:02:36.200> to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
which means mentally you just need to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.490 
which means mentally you just need to
fully<00:02:36.860> commit<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.700> prepare<00:02:38.060> yourself<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.780> by

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
when I first learned heel flips I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.040 
when I first learned heel flips I
learned<00:03:00.170> them<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.530> carpet<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.160> my<00:03:01.310> room

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
obviously you've got to be careful like

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.470 
obviously you've got to be careful like

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
don't do that but just find like a good

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.510 
don't do that but just find like a good
spot<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.020> do<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.470> grass<00:03:15.680> also<00:03:16.070> if

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
spot you can do it on the grass also if

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.190 
spot you can do it on the grass also if
you<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.880> find<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.210> nice<00:03:17.360> spot<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.960> grass

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
you can find a nice spot in the grass

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.400 
you can find a nice spot in the grass
where<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.460> grass<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:20.030> pretty<00:03:20.330> soft<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
where the grass is pretty soft but you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.340 
where the grass is pretty soft but you
can<00:03:21.590> kind<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:21.980> have<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.780> hard<00:03:23.780> enough<00:03:24.020> spot

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
can kind of have like a hard enough spot

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.840 
can kind of have like a hard enough spot
to<00:03:24.560> where<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.800> can<00:03:24.980> put<00:03:25.250> your<00:03:25.280> board<00:03:25.610> and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
to where you can put your board and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.430 
to where you can put your board and
it'll<00:03:26.060> actually<00:03:26.270> pop<00:03:26.690> off<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.080> ground<00:03:27.320> a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it'll actually pop off the ground a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.830 
it'll actually pop off the ground a
little<00:03:27.470> bit<00:03:27.710> then<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.640> can<00:03:28.850> do<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.720> I

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
little bit then you can do that and I

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.680 
little bit then you can do that and I
think<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.140> will<00:03:30.710> honestly<00:03:30.860> also<00:03:31.490> help<00:03:31.760> so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
think that will honestly also help so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.080 
think that will honestly also help so
yeah<00:03:32.870> overall<00:03:33.080> your<00:03:33.800> flick<00:03:34.220> looks<00:03:34.610> really

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090
