00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.920
 and so the researchers imagine the activity of genes 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.629
 an ab reader enzyme migrates across the vienna 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.909
 and copy the section 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.320
 This copy is a construction manual for a specific protein 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.070
 unless 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.600
 very specific molecules Hero 2 Afton contact the GmbH 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.060
 that can not be read 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 it is abolished 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 Christoph Claas researches at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.260
 these processes 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 It has long been known that diminished sutile dena cancer 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.560
 can trigger 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.900
 Christoph Plass found out that this also kicked off the field Â» 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 can 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.210
 the sensational if you will 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.680
 was that at the time 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.240
 Percent we have found that it is much more epigenetic 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 Change there as a man had ever accepted 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.980
 and possibly much more epigenetic changes than 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 genetic change 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.510
 Thousands of epigenetic switches are blocked in some cancers 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.660
 on the environment Belgium so it comes from 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.990
 and unlike the naked the Jenaer 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.050
 is not it the same everywhere? 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.400
 it is different in each of the 200 human counters 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.300
 the discovery of the gameshow Alcohol at additional costs of the processes in the nucleus 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 which does not prevent the hair colors hovering around two meters long 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 he is not present 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.810
 the effect given is determined without the environment 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.230
 and that is the new one 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.130
 at the farms 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 the interplay of this kind of struck tours 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.509
 the scientists want interested 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.640
 new ones help them 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 There was good facility that resembles that of the people very much 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.710
 so the same ones could work the PI genetic switches as well 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.829
 In specially bred crayfish, mice suffering from leukemia found the 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.169
 Heidelberg researchers long before the onset of the disease clear 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.599
 had to go from disused 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.709
 if the genotype of human patients developed a similar pattern 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.440
 very early epigenetic test on this form of leukemia feasible 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.449
 indeed 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.469
 The cancer researchers find numerous identical changes 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.889
 the epigenetic early diagnosis 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.949
 moves within reach 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.969
 maybe even a therapy 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.270
 Perform Ebikon 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.169
 the term GP from Pre Fishing this is what it means now samples at the Biennale 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.039
 dbna sequence that go 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.279
 is still fully intact that's just the switch 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.419
 if it is 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.239
 and of course one now thinks about therapies after how can one the switch 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.939
 back to the right position 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.479
 and how do you go about turning a tumor into a presser again 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 so that the cell stops growing 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.049
 for a special one by emirate 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.769
 that is probably already succeeded 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.429
 but with up to 30 000 failures cell threatens 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:26.499
 is still largely unclear where other epigenetic drugs attack St
