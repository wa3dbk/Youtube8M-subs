00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.120 
our team this year I feel like we've got
a<00:01:37.429> good<00:01:37.670> talented<00:01:38.479> group<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.780> guys<00:01:39.130> again

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
a good talented group of guys again

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.370 
a good talented group of guys again
we're<00:01:40.280> hungry<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.729> win<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.659> we<00:01:41.899> understand

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
we're hungry to win and we understand

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.959 
we're hungry to win and we understand
that<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.649> have<00:01:42.679> maybe<00:01:43.070> let<00:01:43.310> down<00:01:43.520> some<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.759> our

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
that we have maybe let down some of our

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.029 
that we have maybe let down some of our
fans<00:01:44.179> in<00:01:44.359> the<00:01:44.450> past<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:45.109> I<00:01:45.229> think<00:01:45.439> they<00:01:45.590> should

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
fans in the past and I think they should

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.800 
fans in the past and I think they should
expect<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.640> new<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:46.969> new<00:01:47.240> look<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.600> think<00:01:47.719> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
expect a new a new look I think the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.649 
expect a new a new look I think the
biggest<00:01:47.990> thing<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.439> we<00:01:48.950> can<00:01:49.100> show<00:01:49.249> that<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.549> are

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
biggest thing is we can show that we are

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.260 
biggest thing is we can show that we are
here<00:01:50.659> we<00:01:50.840> can<00:01:51.079> play<00:01:51.880> it's<00:01:52.880> finally<00:01:53.179> getting

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
here we can play it's finally getting

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.179 
here we can play it's finally getting
our<00:01:53.479> pride<00:01:53.689> back<00:01:53.929> either<00:01:54.439> get<00:01:54.740> better<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.100> get

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
our pride back either get better you get

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.919 
our pride back either get better you get
worse<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:55.670> think<00:01:55.850> stays<00:01:55.999> the<00:01:56.090> same<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.479> our

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
worse and I think stays the same so our

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:57.940 
worse and I think stays the same so our
biggest<00:01:57.229> thing<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.439> always<00:01:57.590> making<00:01:57.920> sure

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
biggest thing is always making sure

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.810 
biggest thing is always making sure
we're<00:01:58.130> getting<00:01:58.310> better

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
