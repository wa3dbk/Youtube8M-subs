on<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.810> role<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.049> inflammation<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.980> dry

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
on the role of inflammation in dry

on the role of inflammation in dry
I doctors<00:02:17.480> are<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:17.810> focusing<00:02:18.410> more<00:02:18.680> on

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
I doctors are now focusing more on

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.100 
I doctors are now focusing more on
getting<00:02:19.310> at<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.610> root<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> problem<00:02:20.540> by
