 12 or e-mail the milk donohue no bill 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 the state without breaking but hey it's 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 again this is where you come from 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.570
 answer to your question 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's because it has consequences 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 important adjoumani goes further he 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 said 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 when there was what sir hold 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 Egyptians who was called I believe they 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.809
 sort said ismaÃ¯l who decided is this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 not to Europeanise Egyptian society 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.440
 what did he do he sent people here 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 to reorganize who brought 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 then in Egypt culture and there was 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 already opera etc 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.299
 he says what to go to the opera throw the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.320
 rich people and inevitably we've been 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.189
 driven by their driver 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 the driver their a stupid example 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.770
 at times there as in comoros 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
 besides all all 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.689
 events of life was organized 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.400
 around the prayer we say barbara 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.290
 matera there is a meeting a mass bar 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 after the province a barbecue while 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.270
 the most left now who at 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.450
 the opera the example he takes he says 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.899
 but the driver he is employed part 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 by someone who until then was in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.450
 this organization 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.049
 but as he came out of this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 organization at the cinema ivan silva that and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.220
 well his driver him what is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 pass he'll have to go with him everywhere 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.210
 will I be able to do the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.860
 prayer to value since his employer 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.040
 do not do it we do not do it to them 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.920
 taste 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.630
 because he's going to have to wait for the sound 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 employer who has returned to the opera 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.400
 he has no right to go back there 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.270
 do not enter 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.479
 outside that's how things are 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.300
 are going to start and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.420
 prayer its importance it was crazy let go 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.520
 in nature otherwise when 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.580
 the organization was still of this 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.230
 way things did not get done like 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.310
 that's ok and to drive the question on 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.900
 could we possibly do some 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.900
 lectures on this story there ford
