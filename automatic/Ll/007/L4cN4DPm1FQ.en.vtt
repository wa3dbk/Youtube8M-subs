Queen rainbow not a very good flop for

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
Queen rainbow not a very good flop for
two<00:00:45.989> eights<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.800> max<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
two eights but I think max has got to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
two eights but I think max has got to
take<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> stab<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> C<00:00:48.600> bet<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> position

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
take a stab with a C bet in position

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
take a stab with a C bet in position
anyway<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:50.460> does<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.910> 1700<00:00:55.550> minière<00:00:56.550> he

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
anyway and he does about 1700 minière he

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
anyway and he does about 1700 minière he
calls<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.510> quick<00:00:57.780> call<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.500> dry

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
calls pretty quick call and it's a dry

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
calls pretty quick call and it's a dry
board<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.399> he's<00:00:59.550> probably<00:00:59.789> not<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> draw

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
