would recommend that you get these on

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.760 
would recommend that you get these on
eBay<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.090> buy<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.930> larger

eBay because you can buy them in larger

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.150 
eBay because you can buy them in larger
quantities<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.910> cheaper<00:00:45.860> like<00:00:46.860> for
