00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.279
 the people now we 're going to make a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.070
 fast homemade hamburger recipe 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.050
 here we have a pound of duckling 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.200
 grinded a teaspoon here and if it is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 the case you can put fine herbs 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.820
 As the daughters did not have what I am 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 using mixed because that serves 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.150
 in the market 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 Mixed parsley is tongue and onion 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:47.690
 here is just enough and a little pin 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.690
 of black pepper to taste 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.690
 Okay, so here we go. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 do we mix all the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.110
 ingredients and move quickly here 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.110
 and not lose consistency 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.860
 work quickly 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.530
 Look, I 'm putting a lot of salt and one 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.659
 teaspoon 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.510
 Let's tie it for mixed it here. 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm going to stick to these hamburger's that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.020
 I'm going to enjoy it then, I've mixed that look. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.670
 It's okay to be free. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 if you prefer you can do this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.939
 here eat chopped or grated onion and a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 a little salt left or even diary in the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.430
 past is also not good yet the 0 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 daughters of this strange mixture that I 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.380
 I did it well, I already mixed it up here. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 transfer to this board and we will 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.689
 moderate the burgers I'm going to make 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.300
 I will give a spread 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.280
 this mass here 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.750
 I'm going to do a little Guinea. It was not much. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.000
 honey, I really like it, let's try to see if 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.000
 We can make six hamburgers. 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.680
 if you scream 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.320
 we respect 1 now that the rest 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.550
 and with corrections it's fine then 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.340
 This is what I'm going to do, I'm going to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:31.350
 heating up the idea they have invested 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:36.590
 a spoon 6 flex or more - and olive oil 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.590
 butter oil your preference 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.850
 this is what we can not put the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:03:03.380
 hamburger in the cold eye is fine weather 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:03.380
 morumbi that will spread the hamburg 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.620
 if you will have difficulty that will affect here 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.570
 the hamburger with him that number you 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.850
 can take the safe is more or less for 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.140
 15 minutes of things to stay 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.980
 with tranquility 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.260
 well this is going to stay more or less here 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.860
 So we're going to leave him there and say that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:33.510
 we will face a clear choice 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:40.579
 again in Rome the movie I'm going to put together 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.579
 I'm going to prepare another woman 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.750
 look here more a bourgeois as I go 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.520
 I'll put it here 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.100
 classic is here 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.070
 if the third burger I think 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:07.470
 flower is already hot 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:09.690
 he made that little noise of 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.370
 one time hamburger 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.760
 so let's wait and respect big 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.470
 15 minutes these packages here I 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.770
 I'll leave it frozen as soon as the bugs 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.810
 they are hard rolled in the film role 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.600
 and leave in the freezer until ready to 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.210
 use when you choose and do not need 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.990
 thaw even though it looks 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.970
 I gave the movie mole and went straight into 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.930
 hot frying pans 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.940
 while here it is more or less five 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.360
 minutes I will not come in once I go 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:55.830
 turn once and look at it 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:05:00.840
 everything looks like we'll see is leaving 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.590
 at least another 15 minutes and you're done 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.620
 You can make known burger in the plate. 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.640
 but you saw only half a scoop 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.570
 Olive oil soup accept it because it does not 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.770
 needs to be oil- soaked if you 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.770
 avoid culture in your diet 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.710
 Look, you have no more freedom and freedom from 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.800
 Brazil on the other side and if you 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.720
 I would not miss less time would 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.350
 spend more time controlling 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.210
 OK 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.070
 We are going to check here and we will 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.640
 your mouth and see how it is 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:50.630
 look from the point I'm going to deflect soft fire 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:52.340
 underneath is that we burger with which the 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.190
 People are going to be like I said. 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.840

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.520
 power a bug can be a powerful 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.990
 heated element 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.210
 You can do a little better in this. 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.870
 a little mustard a few slices of 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.180

 if it is a dish accompanied also by 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.280
