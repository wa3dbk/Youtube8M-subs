case<00:01:18.810> we've<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.350> couple<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.860> bits

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
case we've got a couple of little bits

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
case we've got a couple of little bits
and<00:01:20.460> pieces<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.850> let's<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> look<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:22.290> have

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and pieces so let's have a look we have

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.399 
and pieces so let's have a look we have
got<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.299> microphone<00:01:24.299> mount<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.380> use

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
got a microphone mount so you would use

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
got a microphone mount so you would use
this<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.130> were<00:01:26.340> mounting<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this if you were mounting this on a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
this if you were mounting this on a
microphone<00:01:27.540> stand<00:01:27.780> sort<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.710> off<00:01:28.860> camera

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
microphone stand sort of off camera

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.120 
microphone stand sort of off camera
there's<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.540> thread<00:01:31.020> adapter<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.920> take

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
there's also a thread adapter to take

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
there's also a thread adapter to take
this<00:01:32.369> thread<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> smaller<00:01:33.960> size<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this thread down to a smaller size so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130 
this thread down to a smaller size so
it's<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.920> screw<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> would

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it's all screw that in and then it would

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's all screw that in and then it would
take<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.829> smaller<00:01:38.250> threaded

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
take it down to the smaller threaded

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
take it down to the smaller threaded
size<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.659> you've<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> couple<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> o-rings

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
size and you've got a couple of o-rings

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.359 
size and you've got a couple of o-rings
for<00:01:41.869> when<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:42.990> putting<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> onto<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.950> XLR

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
for when you're putting it onto an XLR

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
for when you're putting it onto an XLR
cable<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.229> sort<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> reduce

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
cable or this would sort of reduce

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
cable or this would sort of reduce
vibrations<00:01:47.970> give<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> nice<00:01:48.420> sort<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> solid

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
vibrations give you a nice sort of solid

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
vibrations give you a nice sort of solid
connection<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.740> exile<00:01:50.130> cable<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.479> you've

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
connection on your exile cable so you've

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.910 
connection on your exile cable so you've
got<00:01:51.659> those<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:51.810> bits<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.740> got<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
got those two bits and then we got the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
got those two bits and then we got the
microphone<00:01:53.310> itself<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> let's<00:01:54.119> show<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
microphone itself so let's show you the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.859 
microphone itself so let's show you the
mic<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> pop<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.630> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
mic so pop that back in there so this is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
mic so pop that back in there so this is
the<00:01:58.469> microphone<00:01:59.159> itself<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.880> let<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the microphone itself and I will let you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.709 
the microphone itself and I will let you
know<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> pricing<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.740> round<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.719> 133

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
know the pricing on this round about 133

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.760 
know the pricing on this round about 133
pounds<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.820> 173<00:02:05.820> dollars<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.600> cheap

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
pounds or 173 dollars so it's not cheap

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.589 
pounds or 173 dollars so it's not cheap
but<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.610> nice<00:02:08.849> looking<00:02:09.179> piece<00:02:09.390> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but it is a really nice looking piece of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.309 
but it is a really nice looking piece of
kit<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.679> let's<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.009> pull<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.340> off

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
kit now let's just pull this off

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.140 
kit now let's just pull this off
come<00:02:12.469> off<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.670> underneath<00:02:14.329> this<00:02:14.650> sort<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.709> foam

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
come off so underneath this sort of foam

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.720 
come off so underneath this sort of foam
cover<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.569> can<00:02:17.749> see<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.319> actual<00:02:18.730> microphones

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
cover you can see the actual microphones

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.199 
cover you can see the actual microphones
or<00:02:20.120> circuitry<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.139> the<00:02:21.849> capsule<00:02:22.849> in<00:02:22.969> there

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
or circuitry and the capsule in there

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.379 
or circuitry and the capsule in there
and<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.079> stay<00:02:24.769> on<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.099> end<00:02:25.310> which<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.209> where

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:26.389 
and then stay on this end which is where

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.539 
and then stay on this end which is where
all<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.659> microphone<00:02:27.079> pickup<00:02:27.439> is<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.069> then

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
all the microphone pickup is and then

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.059 
all the microphone pickup is and then
around<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.120> end<00:02:29.389> we<00:02:29.750> have<00:02:29.959> got<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.349> XLR

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
around this end we have got the XLR

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.920 
around this end we have got the XLR
connection<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.840> let's<00:02:33.019> put<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.489> foam

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
connection so let's put this foam

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.360 
connection so let's put this foam
windshield<00:02:35.930> back<00:02:36.109> on<00:02:36.170> that's<00:02:36.829> back<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.189> there

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
windshield back on that's back on there

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.970 
windshield back on that's back on there
and<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:37.879> is<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> go<00:02:38.419> on<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.079> XF<00:02:39.409> 100

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
and this is going to go on to the XF 100

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.030 
and this is going to go on to the XF 100
now<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.639> XF<00:02:40.939> 100<00:02:41.510> has<00:02:41.629> XLR<00:02:42.260> inputs<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
now the XF 100 has XLR inputs but you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.809 
now the XF 100 has XLR inputs but you
could<00:02:43.280> use<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.599> with<00:02:44.599> sign<00:02:45.169> like<00:02:45.500> an<00:02:46.489> audio

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
could use this with sign like an audio

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.439 
could use this with sign like an audio
interface<00:02:47.239> with<00:02:48.139> a<00:02:48.169> regular<00:02:48.980> DSLR<00:02:49.760> camera<00:02:50.209> to

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:50.449 
interface with a regular DSLR camera to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.140 
interface with a regular DSLR camera to
convert<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.439> XLR<00:02:51.919> or<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.699> could<00:02:52.819> use<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
convert to the XLR or you could use it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300 
convert to the XLR or you could use it
with<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.329> USB<00:02:53.870> audio<00:02:54.139> interface<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:54.980> really

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
with a USB audio interface if you really

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.159 
with a USB audio interface if you really
wanted<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.150> really<00:02:56.329> designed<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.930> be

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
wanted to but it's really designed to be

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.959 
wanted to but it's really designed to be
used<00:02:57.379> with<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> camera<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:58.250> I'm<00:02:58.760> just

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
used with the camera so I'm just

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.030 
used with the camera so I'm just
unscrewing<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.750> mount<00:03:00.109> at<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.530> top<00:03:00.799> here

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
unscrewing this mount at the top here

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.360 
unscrewing this mount at the top here
and<00:03:01.219> we're<00:03:01.819> going<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:01.969> slide<00:03:02.359> this<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:03.189> now<00:03:04.189> got

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
and we're going to slide this in now got

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.729 
and we're going to slide this in now got
extra<00:03:04.760> padding<00:03:05.120> around<00:03:05.419> here<00:03:05.659> because<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.139> the

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
extra padding around here because on the

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.330 
extra padding around here because on the
XF<00:03:07.069> 100<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:08.480> mount<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:09.319> sometimes<00:03:10.159> isn't

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
XF 100 this mount here sometimes isn't

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.830 
XF 100 this mount here sometimes isn't
isn't<00:03:10.909> great<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.389> I've<00:03:11.449> got<00:03:11.569> some<00:03:11.719> extra

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
isn't great so I've got some extra

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.920 
isn't great so I've got some extra
orange<00:03:12.230> soft<00:03:13.120> padding<00:03:14.120> on<00:03:14.239> there<00:03:14.480> let's<00:03:14.780> do

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
orange soft padding on there let's do

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.229 
orange soft padding on there let's do
this<00:03:15.049> up<00:03:15.260> here<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.310> I'm<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.579> going<00:03:16.759> to<00:03:16.819> screw

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
this up here so I'm just going to screw

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.439 
this up here so I'm just going to screw
this<00:03:17.419> down<00:03:17.689> to<00:03:18.500> mount<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.889> microphone<00:03:19.489> so

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
this down to mount the microphone so

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.659 
this down to mount the microphone so
there<00:03:20.629> we<00:03:20.750> go<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:21.079> mounted<00:03:21.650> onto<00:03:21.949> the

there we go that's mounted onto the

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.999 
there we go that's mounted onto the
camcorder<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:23.750> or<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.229> video<00:03:24.500> camera<00:03:24.979> I

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:25.009 
camcorder now or the video camera I

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.069 
camcorder now or the video camera I
should<00:03:25.189> call<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.699> I'm<00:03:26.329> going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.659> connect

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
should call it and I'm going to connect

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.439 
should call it and I'm going to connect
this<00:03:27.199> fire<00:03:27.439> XLR<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.340> going<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.669> go<00:03:28.790> into<00:03:29.299> one

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
this fire XLR it's going to go into one

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.390 
this fire XLR it's going to go into one
of<00:03:29.479> these<00:03:29.599> inputs<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.650> side<00:03:30.949> here<00:03:31.280> and

inbuilt microphones on the XF 100 then

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.649 
inbuilt microphones on the XF 100 then
I'm<00:03:40.189> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> switch<00:03:40.639> over<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.419> Audio

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
I'm going to switch over to the Audio

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.490 
I'm going to switch over to the Audio
Technica<00:03:41.900> mic<00:03:42.470> you'll<00:03:43.250> also<00:03:43.519> see<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.329> change<00:03:45.169> in

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
Technica mic you'll also see a change in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.080 
Technica mic you'll also see a change in
the<00:03:45.709> video<00:03:45.949> quality<00:03:46.220> as<00:03:46.579> well<00:03:46.759> because<00:03:47.000> I'm

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the video quality as well because I'm

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.640 
the video quality as well because I'm
going<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.239> be<00:03:47.329> switching<00:03:47.599> with<00:03:47.959> from<00:03:48.470> the

100 I'm recording this with and
connected<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.620> via<00:04:37.890> an<00:04:38.100> XLR<00:04:38.700> cable<00:04:39.260> also

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
connected to it via an XLR cable also

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.050 
connected to it via an XLR cable also
worth<00:04:40.500> noting<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.100> now<00:04:41.670> I've<00:04:41.790> got<00:04:41.970> this

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
worth noting that now I've got this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.420 
worth noting that now I've got this
microphone<00:04:42.660> connected<00:04:43.200> I've<00:04:43.620> set<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.220> audio

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
microphone connected I've set the audio

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.520 
microphone connected I've set the audio
levels<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.270> manual<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.870> gives<00:04:46.170> me<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.290> lot

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
levels to manual so that gives me a lot

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.650 
levels to manual so that gives me a lot
more<00:04:46.590> control<00:04:46.980> as<00:04:47.460> well<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.330> should<00:04:48.540> be

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
more control as well and you should be

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.420 
more control as well and you should be
hearing<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.050> lot<00:04:49.200> clearer<00:04:49.560> audio<00:04:50.040> or

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
hearing a lot clearer audio or

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.670 
hearing a lot clearer audio or
definition<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.210> my<00:04:51.360> voice<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:52.320> that's<00:04:52.500> what

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
definition in my voice and that's what

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.260 
definition in my voice and that's what
you<00:04:52.770> get<00:04:52.950> when<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.220> spend<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.760> little<00:04:53.880> bit<00:04:54.030> more

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
you get when you spend a little bit more

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.840 
you get when you spend a little bit more
on<00:04:54.450> an<00:04:54.600> external<00:04:55.020> microphone<00:04:55.640> now<00:04:56.640> don't

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
on an external microphone now don't

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.380 
on an external microphone now don't
forget<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.810> audio<00:04:58.320> technique<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.010> 88<00:04:59.490> 75<00:05:00.090> are

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390

forget the audio technique and 88 75 are
also<00:05:00.750> has<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.080> added<00:05:01.470> flexibility<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.460> could

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
also has that added flexibility I could

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.150 
also has that added flexibility I could
use<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.270> longer<00:05:03.600> cable<00:05:03.870> amount<00:05:04.770> it's<00:05:04.950> sort<00:05:05.130> of

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
use a longer cable amount it's sort of

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.190 
use a longer cable amount it's sort of
just<00:05:05.220> in<00:05:05.520> front<00:05:05.730> of<00:05:05.820> me<00:05:05.940> here<00:05:06.210> or<00:05:06.360> if<00:05:06.990> I'm<00:05:07.170> doing

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
just in front of me here or if I'm doing

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.650 
just in front of me here or if I'm doing
on<00:05:07.620> location<00:05:08.250> recordings<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.000> could<00:05:09.480> have<00:05:09.630> a

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
on location recordings I could have a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.080 
on location recordings I could have a
longer<00:05:10.230> cable<00:05:10.410> or<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.860> wireless<00:05:11.190> cable<00:05:11.700> pack

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
longer cable or a wireless cable pack

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.690 
longer cable or a wireless cable pack
and<00:05:12.330> actually<00:05:13.320> use<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.560> for<00:05:13.740> sort<00:05:14.100> interview

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
and actually use it for sort interview

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.940 
and actually use it for sort interview
