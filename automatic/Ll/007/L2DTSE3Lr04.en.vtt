so I think the pup international is cool

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.780 
so I think the pup international is cool
because<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> most

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
I'm seeing that like choreography is

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.729 
I'm seeing that like choreography is
kind<00:02:28.359> of<00:02:28.420> taking<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.810> change<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.200> little<00:02:29.319> bit<00:02:29.439> for

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
kind of taking a change a little bit for

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.440 
kind of taking a change a little bit for
like<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.280> style<00:02:30.549> they're<00:02:30.970> starting<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.299> pick

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
like the style they're starting to pick

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.179 
like the style they're starting to pick
up<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.659> a<00:02:31.689> lot<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.900> different<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:33.099> know

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
up on a lot of different you know

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.149 
up on a lot of different you know
thousand<00:02:33.700> music<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.349> really<00:02:35.349> introducing

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
thousand music and really introducing

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.559 
thousand music and really introducing
like<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> lot<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> lot<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:37.030> new<00:02:37.150> things<00:02:37.180> are

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
like a lot a lot of new things are

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.879 
like a lot a lot of new things are
always<00:02:37.720> coming<00:02:38.019> with<00:02:38.200> something<00:02:38.439> new<00:02:38.530> even<00:02:38.709> in

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
always coming with something new even in

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.679 
always coming with something new even in
a<00:02:38.980> two-minute<00:02:39.400> choreography<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.329> I<00:02:40.359> think<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
a two-minute choreography so I think the

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:41.789 
a two-minute choreography so I think the
level<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.989> pretty<00:02:41.139> high<00:02:41.260> Priya<00:02:41.620> pop

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
level is pretty high Priya pop

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.410 
level is pretty high Priya pop
