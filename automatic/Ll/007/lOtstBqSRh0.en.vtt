00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.019 
is my video telling you how I would fix
it<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.380> although<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> mostly<00:00:20.400> aimed<00:00:20.730> at

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
it now although this is mostly aimed at

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.840 
it now although this is mostly aimed at
the<00:00:21.300> British<00:00:21.869> system<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.890> government<00:00:23.310> it's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the British system of government it's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.349 
the British system of government it's
fairly<00:00:24.560> universal<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.830> us<00:00:26.760> definitely<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
fairly universal to us definitely the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
fairly universal to us definitely the
states<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> Europe<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
states and a lot of Europe so this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
states and a lot of Europe so this
should<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.929> relevant<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.830> other

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
should still be relevant to other

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.220 
should still be relevant to other
countries<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.969> well<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:33.989> main

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
countries as well so the two main

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.870 
countries as well so the two main
problems<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.070> politics<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
moment is I don't feel represented and I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
moment is I don't feel represented and I
don't<00:00:39.000> feel<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.899> control<00:00:40.230> now<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> the

don't feel in control now one of the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
don't feel in control now one of the
reasons<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> feel<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.420> control<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
reasons I feel out of control we're in

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.740 
reasons I feel out of control we're in
our<00:00:43.590> current<00:00:43.920> political<00:00:44.160> system<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
these people in fact it's not even that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
these people in fact it's not even that
because<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> first-past-the-post<00:00:57.510> system

because in a first-past-the-post system

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
because in a first-past-the-post system
I'm<00:00:59.370> only<00:00:59.670> actually<00:01:00.030> voting<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> first

and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> second<00:01:01.770> place<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.789> anything

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and the second place because anything

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.719 
and the second place because anything
else<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> wasted<00:01:04.080> vote<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.549> from

four and a half thousand options and
only<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.030> allowed<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> choose

only actually be allowed to choose

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
only actually be allowed to choose
between<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.530> something<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.920> expect<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
between two is something I expect of a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
between two is something I expect of a
free-to-play<00:01:12.150> game<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.049> something<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
free-to-play game it's not something I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
free-to-play game it's not something I
expect<00:01:13.770> from<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.979> society<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> called<00:01:15.330> itself

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
expect from a society that called itself

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
expect from a society that called itself
free<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> reasons<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> feel<00:01:17.759> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
free one of the reasons I feel so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
free one of the reasons I feel so
underrepresented<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:19.259> government<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
underrepresented in government is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
underrepresented in government is
because<00:01:20.189> politicians<00:01:20.850> themselves<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.780> not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
because politicians themselves do not

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
because politicians themselves do not
know<00:01:22.229> who<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.710> represent<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.090> their

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
know who they represent you see if their

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.330 
know who they represent you see if their
name<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> gets<00:01:25.020> ticked<00:01:25.380> off<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> ballot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
name that gets ticked off on the ballot

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
name that gets ticked off on the ballot
so<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.880> thought<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> vote

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so you don't thought they have to vote

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
so you don't thought they have to vote
their<00:01:28.380> own<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.860> however<00:01:29.549> they're<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
their own way however they're also a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
their own way however they're also a
member<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.079> political<00:01:31.799> party<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
member of political party and that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
member of political party and that
political<00:01:33.299> party<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.710> why<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
political party also is why a lot of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800 
political party also is why a lot of
people<00:01:35.430> vote<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:35.970> them<00:01:36.299> without<00:01:36.450> paying

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
people vote for them without paying

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
people vote for them without paying
attention<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.439> who<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
attention to who it is so if those two

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
attention to who it is so if those two
ever<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:39.930> question<00:01:40.560> which<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.220> do

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
ever come into question which way do

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
ever come into question which way do
they<00:01:41.549> vote<00:01:41.759> well<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> them

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
they vote well that's up to them

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.859 
they vote well that's up to them
fortunately<00:01:44.310> those<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:45.030> things<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.630> come

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
fortunately those two things don't come

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.620 
fortunately those two things don't come
into<00:01:46.020> contrast<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.280> often<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.270> does

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
into contrast all that often what does

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
into contrast all that often what does
come<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.170> contrast<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.700> people

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
come into contrast is when the people

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
come into contrast is when the people
who<00:01:51.270> paid<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> money<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.100> could

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
who paid you the money so that you could

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.969 
who paid you the money so that you could
run<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> view<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> should<00:01:55.619> do

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
run have a view of what you should do

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
run have a view of what you should do
which<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> different<00:01:57.479> from<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
which is different from what you and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
which is different from what you and
your<00:01:58.979> party<00:01:59.460> thinks<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.659> wasn't

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
your party thinks and if that wasn't

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.709 
your party thinks and if that wasn't
complicated<00:02:01.290> enough<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.250> also<00:02:02.759> represent

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
complicated enough you also represent

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.289 
complicated enough you also represent
the<00:02:04.290> people<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> area<00:02:05.610> whether<00:02:06.060> they

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the people of the area whether they

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.710 
the people of the area whether they
voted<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> UK<00:02:09.479> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
voted for you or not and in the UK we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360 
voted for you or not and in the UK we
have<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:10.050> than<00:02:10.200> two<00:02:10.440> parties<00:02:10.709> which<00:02:11.160> means

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
have more than two parties which means

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.290 
have more than two parties which means
the<00:02:12.000> likelihood<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the likelihood is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.110 
the likelihood is
most<00:02:13.720> people<00:02:14.200> did<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.470> vote<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.640> which

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
most people did not vote for you which

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.340 
most people did not vote for you which
means<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.630> were<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.870> accurately

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
means if you were to accurately

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.820 
means if you were to accurately
represent<00:02:17.680> your<00:02:18.190> area<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.420> should<00:02:19.450> act<00:02:20.020> not

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
represent your area you should act not

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.950 
represent your area you should act not
like<00:02:21.220> yourself<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.210> your<00:02:22.570> party<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:24.750> yes<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
like yourself or your party or yes and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.640 
like yourself or your party or yes and
no<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.860> does<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.790> no<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:28.960> really<00:02:29.410> knows

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
no one does that so no one really knows

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.920 
no one does that so no one really knows
who<00:02:30.040> they<00:02:30.280> represent<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.300> how<00:02:31.420> would<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.600> solve

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
who they represent so how would I solve

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.660 
who they represent so how would I solve
this<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.500> first<00:02:32.710> thing<00:02:32.860> I'd<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.460> rid

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
this the first thing I'd do is get rid

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.720 
this the first thing I'd do is get rid
of<00:02:33.730> areas<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.620> hold<00:02:35.980> votes

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
of areas in which you have to hold votes

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.340 
of areas in which you have to hold votes
honestly<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.540> came<00:02:37.750> from<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.990> days<00:02:38.140> of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
honestly this came from the days of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.050 
honestly this came from the days of
games<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.950> Thrones<00:02:39.280> where<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.640> best<00:02:39.850> way<00:02:40.030> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
games of Thrones where the best way to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.420 
games of Thrones where the best way to
contact<00:02:40.600> someone<00:02:40.810> was<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.680> ride<00:02:42.190> on

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
contact someone was to go and ride on

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.340 
contact someone was to go and ride on
horseback<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.450> could<00:02:43.630> tell<00:02:44.080> them

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
horseback so that you could tell them

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.620 
horseback so that you could tell them
your<00:02:44.590> issue<00:02:44.800> or<00:02:45.010> find<00:02:45.670> out<00:02:45.820> what<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> politics

your issue or find out what the politics
of<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.870> matter<00:02:47.080> was<00:02:47.320> whereas<00:02:47.890> these<00:02:48.100> days<00:02:48.370> I

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
of a matter was whereas these days I

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.880 
of a matter was whereas these days I
could<00:02:48.880> tweet<00:02:49.180> someone<00:02:49.540> or<00:02:49.900> email<00:02:50.650> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
could tweet someone or email a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.860 
could tweet someone or email a
politician<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> response<00:02:52.420> back

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
politician and get a response back

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.590 
politician and get a response back
before<00:02:53.620> you've<00:02:54.070> even<00:02:54.190> left<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.850> house<00:02:55.150> it's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
before you've even left the house it's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.020 
before you've even left the house it's
really<00:02:56.050> an<00:02:56.140> outdated<00:02:56.530> system<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> we<00:02:57.730> should

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
really an outdated system and we should

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.950 
really an outdated system and we should
get<00:02:58.240> rid<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.510> it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
get rid of it

get rid of it
the<00:02:59.110> second<00:02:59.440> thing<00:02:59.560> I'd<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.370> get

the second thing I'd like to do is get

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.330 
the second thing I'd like to do is get
rid<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.240> idea<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.540> winning<00:03:02.050> an<00:03:02.470> election<00:03:02.800> I

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.890 
rid of the idea of winning an election I
mean<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.270> is<00:03:04.360> gonna<00:03:04.510> sound<00:03:04.600> weird

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
mean I know this is gonna sound weird

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.920 
mean I know this is gonna sound weird
saying<00:03:05.440> everyone's<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.460> winner<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.630> that's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
saying everyone's a winner but that's

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
saying everyone's a winner but that's
how<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.380> should<00:03:08.410> work

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
how it should work

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.490 
how it should work
if<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.670> vote<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.300> someone<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.780> represent<00:03:10.960> me

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
if I vote for someone to represent me

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.100 
if I vote for someone to represent me
they<00:03:12.220> should<00:03:12.520> represent<00:03:12.850> me<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.780> that's

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
they should represent me and that's

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.010 
they should represent me and that's
really<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.530> core<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.880> idea<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:16.450> those

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
really the core of this idea just those

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.410 
really the core of this idea just those
two<00:03:17.320> simple<00:03:17.709> ideas<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.880> could<00:03:19.150> vote<00:03:19.360> for

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
two simple ideas if I could vote for

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.140 
two simple ideas if I could vote for
someone<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.140> then<00:03:20.470> they<00:03:20.650> represent<00:03:21.310> me<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
someone and then they represent me and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.870 
someone and then they represent me and
they<00:03:22.690> in<00:03:22.810> fact<00:03:22.990> represent<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:24.040> exact<00:03:24.430> number

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
they in fact represent the exact number

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.170 
they in fact represent the exact number
of<00:03:24.910> people<00:03:25.030> who<00:03:25.870> voted<00:03:25.900> for<00:03:26.440> them<00:03:27.030> then<00:03:28.030> I'd

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
of people who voted for them then I'd

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.900 
of people who voted for them then I'd
have<00:03:28.390> someone<00:03:28.720> who<00:03:29.320> answers<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.950> me<00:03:30.340> which<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
have someone who answers to me which is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.640 
have someone who answers to me which is
a<00:03:31.060> stark<00:03:31.360> contrast<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> current<00:03:32.200> system

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
a stark contrast to the current system

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.110 
a stark contrast to the current system
or<00:03:32.950> which<00:03:33.100> if<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.340> didn't<00:03:33.580> vote<00:03:33.610> for<00:03:33.850> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
or which if you didn't vote for the

or which if you didn't vote for the
person<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.690> first<00:03:34.990> place<00:03:35.320> or<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:36.040> they're

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430

those are two of the most unlike things
about<00:04:40.690> politics<00:04:41.320> why<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:41.920> we<00:04:42.220> not<00:04:42.400> doing<00:04:42.790> this

done<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.950> before<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.730> because<00:04:45.940> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
done it before is because the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.870 
done it before is because the
politicians<00:04:47.440> don't<00:04:47.800> have<00:04:47.920> equal<00:04:48.400> value

so I will now quickly address those one

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.550 
so I will now quickly address those one

then become a politician this means we

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.780 
then become a politician this means we
couldn't<00:05:28.630> give<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> full<00:05:29.050> wage<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:30.160> everyone

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
couldn't give a full wage to everyone

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.210 
couldn't give a full wage to everyone
who<00:05:31.030> was<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.570> politician<00:05:31.840> we<00:05:32.650> could<00:05:32.800> only<00:05:32.950> give

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
who was a politician we could only give

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.120 
who was a politician we could only give
it<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.910> set<00:05:34.450> bandwidth<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.380> then<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.830> lower

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
it to a set bandwidth and then a lower

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.860 
it to a set bandwidth and then a lower
bandwidth<00:05:36.730> but<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.060> still<00:05:37.330> think<00:05:37.600> that<00:05:37.660> this

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
bandwidth but I still think that this

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.410 
bandwidth but I still think that this
would<00:05:38.080> be<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.230> much<00:05:38.470> better<00:05:39.010> option<00:05:39.550> than<00:05:40.060> the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
would be a much better option than the

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.600 
would be a much better option than the
previous<00:05:40.990> system<00:05:41.260> of<00:05:41.710> course<00:05:42.100> when<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.400> then

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
previous system of course when we then

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.300 
previous system of course when we then
have<00:05:42.820> bandwidth<00:05:43.480> if<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:44.350> came<00:05:44.590> close<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.280> a

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
have bandwidth if you came close to a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.550 
have bandwidth if you came close to a
bandwidth<00:05:45.850> they<00:05:46.330> would<00:05:46.480> start<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.990> be<00:05:47.170> more<00:05:47.200> of

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
bandwidth they would start to be more of

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.380 
bandwidth they would start to be more of
an<00:05:47.680> advertising<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.610> that<00:05:48.700> would<00:05:48.820> allow<00:05:49.120> some

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
an advertising and that would allow some

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.380 
an advertising and that would allow some
of<00:05:49.420> the<00:05:49.570> corruption<00:05:50.170> and<00:05:51.160> big<00:05:51.670> business<00:05:52.210> to

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
of the corruption and big business to

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.390 
of the corruption and big business to
start<00:05:52.600> controlling<00:05:53.110> things<00:05:53.530> again<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.070> that

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
start controlling things again and that

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.760 
start controlling things again and that
would<00:05:54.670> still<00:05:54.970> have<00:05:55.210> an<00:05:55.390> effect<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:56.350> second

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
would still have an effect the second

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.860 
would still have an effect the second
big<00:05:56.920> problem<00:05:57.130> is<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.670> a<00:05:57.700> 51%<00:05:58.660> of<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
big problem is that a 51% of the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.710 
big problem is that a 51% of the
population<00:05:59.020> voted<00:05:59.830> for<00:06:00.010> one<00:06:00.340> person<00:06:01.090> they

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
population voted for one person they

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.180 
population voted for one person they
would<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:02.050> complete<00:06:02.470> control<00:06:02.620> over<00:06:03.100> the

their way and that is a recipe for
disaster

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
disaster

disaster
of<00:06:08.590> course<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:09.250> solution<00:06:09.670> is<00:06:09.730> very<00:06:09.850> simple

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
of course the solution is very simple

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.450 
of course the solution is very simple
all<00:06:10.600> you<00:06:10.750> need<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.990> do<00:06:11.140> is<00:06:11.380> put<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.560> cap<00:06:11.890> on<00:06:12.130> how

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
all you need to do is put a cap on how

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.940 
all you need to do is put a cap on how
much<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.970> can<00:06:13.090> be<00:06:13.240> voted<00:06:13.450> for<00:06:13.900> then<00:06:14.380> anyone

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
much you can be voted for then anyone

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.520 
much you can be voted for then anyone
who<00:06:15.130> voted<00:06:15.430> for<00:06:15.640> you<00:06:16.060> get<00:06:16.450> some<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.780> them<00:06:16.930> vote

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
who voted for you get some of them vote

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.980 
who voted for you get some of them vote
back<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.130> gets<00:06:18.490> to<00:06:18.610> be<00:06:18.730> recast<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.570> course<00:06:19.780> in

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
back and gets to be recast of course in

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.560 
back and gets to be recast of course in
the<00:06:20.140> interest<00:06:20.620> of<00:06:20.800> time<00:06:21.130> when<00:06:21.790> you<00:06:21.910> vote<00:06:22.240> at<00:06:22.540> a

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
the interest of time when you vote at a

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.690 
the interest of time when you vote at a
polling<00:06:22.930> station<00:06:23.200> you<00:06:23.980> would<00:06:24.070> have<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.490> whole

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
polling station you would have a whole

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.700 
polling station you would have a whole
list<00:06:25.030> and<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:25.420> would<00:06:25.570> number<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:26.530> people

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
list and you would number the people

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.310 
list and you would number the people
that<00:06:27.100> you<00:06:27.220> want<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.880> go<00:06:28.030> on<00:06:28.240> in<00:06:28.510> order<00:06:28.990> that<00:06:29.020> you

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
that you want to go on in order that you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.290 
that you want to go on in order that you
want<00:06:29.500> them<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.800> go<00:06:29.980> and<00:06:30.250> then<00:06:30.760> at<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.030> end<00:06:31.150> of

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
want them to go and then at the end of

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.520 
want them to go and then at the end of
that<00:06:31.390> list<00:06:31.660> once<00:06:31.900> you've<00:06:32.080> run<00:06:32.350> out<00:06:32.380> of

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
that list once you've run out of

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.740 
that list once you've run out of
politicians<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.370> trust<00:06:33.640> which<00:06:33.940> quite

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
politicians you trust which quite

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.440 
politicians you trust which quite
frankly<00:06:34.810> is<00:06:35.320> pretty<00:06:35.830> damn<00:06:36.220> quickly<00:06:36.610> you<00:06:37.300> can

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
frankly is pretty damn quickly you can

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.700 
frankly is pretty damn quickly you can
just<00:06:37.660> put<00:06:37.810> your<00:06:37.840> own<00:06:38.140> name

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
just put your own name

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.650 
just put your own name
and<00:06:38.800> then<00:06:39.010> you<00:06:39.250> have<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:39.760> last<00:06:40.030> portion<00:06:40.420> of

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
and then you have the last portion of

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.350 
and then you have the last portion of
your<00:06:40.900> vote<00:06:41.170> which<00:06:41.710> means<00:06:41.980> for<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.640> most<00:06:42.670> part

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
your vote which means for the most part

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.020 
your vote which means for the most part
that's<00:06:43.780> not<00:06:44.170> included<00:06:44.980> in<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.310> system<00:06:45.520> but<00:06:45.940> if

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
that's not included in the system but if

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.460 
that's not included in the system but if
there's<00:06:46.210> something<00:06:46.390> you<00:06:46.630> really<00:06:47.140> care<00:06:47.410> about

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
there's something you really care about

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.220 
there's something you really care about
you<00:06:48.430> could<00:06:48.640> always<00:06:48.790> turn<00:06:49.510> up<00:06:49.750> to<00:06:49.960> Parliament

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
you could always turn up to Parliament

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.850 
you could always turn up to Parliament
to<00:06:50.950> give<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.700> extra<00:06:51.940> percentage<00:06:52.690> that<00:06:53.560> might

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
to give that extra percentage that might

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.440 
to give that extra percentage that might
be<00:06:54.040> needed<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.670> make<00:06:54.820> something<00:06:55.270> that's

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
be needed to make something that's

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.630 
be needed to make something that's
important<00:06:56.080> to<00:06:56.140> you<00:06:56.380> count<00:06:56.800> and<00:06:57.130> I<00:06:57.400> think

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
important to you count and I think

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.700 
important to you count and I think
that's<00:06:57.790> a<00:06:57.880> wonderful<00:06:58.180> system<00:06:59.140> and<00:06:59.320> wouldn't

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
that's a wonderful system and wouldn't

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.750 
that's a wonderful system and wouldn't
that<00:06:59.740> be<00:06:59.860> wonderful

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
that be wonderful

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760 
that be wonderful
we'd<00:07:00.970> have<00:07:01.090> a<00:07:01.120> parliament<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:01.990> represents

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
we'd have a parliament that represents

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.610 
we'd have a parliament that represents
the<00:07:03.070> people<00:07:03.370> and<00:07:03.790> is<00:07:04.120> answerable<00:07:04.930> to<00:07:05.140> the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
the people and is answerable to the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.010 
the people and is answerable to the
people<00:07:06.280> I<00:07:06.400> mean<00:07:06.790> it<00:07:07.000> would<00:07:07.300> be<00:07:07.330> like<00:07:07.510> we're

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
people I mean it would be like we're

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.970 
people I mean it would be like we're
living<00:07:08.320> in<00:07:08.440> a<00:07:08.530> fair<00:07:09.010> world<00:07:10.410> which<00:07:11.410> is<00:07:11.620> probably

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
living in a fair world which is probably

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.970 
living in a fair world which is probably
why<00:07:12.250> it<00:07:12.280> will<00:07:12.490> never<00:07:12.730> happen
