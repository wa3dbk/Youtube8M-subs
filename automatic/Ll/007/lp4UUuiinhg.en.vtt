walkable

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
walkable

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.750 
walkable
Oh

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.220 

which<00:01:32.000> way<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.600> they're<00:01:32.720> trying<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.050> go

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
which way that they're trying to go

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.990 
which way that they're trying to go
think<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:34.100> you're<00:01:34.430> trying<00:01:34.730> to<00:01:34.880> go

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
think of it like you're trying to go

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.920 
think of it like you're trying to go
underneath<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.480> arm<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:35.900> controlling

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
underneath the arm as controlling

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.300 
underneath the arm as controlling
so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.789 

so<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.909> arm<00:01:41.170> here<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.470> she<00:01:42.560> said<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:42.710> was

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
so the arm here that she said I was

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.590 
so the arm here that she said I was
controlling<00:01:43.189> my<00:01:43.280> neck<00:01:43.490> with<00:01:43.700> his<00:01:43.729> arm<00:01:44.060> only

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
controlling my neck with his arm only

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.920 
controlling my neck with his arm only
blood<00:01:44.780> or<00:01:44.930> anything<00:01:45.850> only<00:01:46.850> water<00:01:47.060> needs<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.509> so

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
blood or anything only water needs it so

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.130 
blood or anything only water needs it so
reg<00:01:48.829> put<00:01:49.460> his<00:01:49.549> head<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> mat<00:01:50.060> checking<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
reg put his head on the mat checking and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.139 
reg put his head on the mat checking and
I<00:01:51.200> was<00:01:51.320> only<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:51.590> underneath<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.369> arm<00:01:52.670> so

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
I was only one underneath this arm so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.450 
I was only one underneath this arm so
know<00:01:53.390> how<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.899> arm<00:01:54.170> creates<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.649> frame<00:01:54.950> so

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
know how this arm creates a frame so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.160 
know how this arm creates a frame so
that<00:01:55.490> i<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.700> get<00:01:55.850> my<00:01:55.939> head<00:01:56.180> out

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.520 

try<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.500> music<00:02:03.830> try<00:02:04.340> that
