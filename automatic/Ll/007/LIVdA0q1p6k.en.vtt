these four units I would say are quite
equally<00:00:45.679> effective<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:46.879> big<00:00:47.209> battles<00:00:47.709> along

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:48.709

really<00:00:52.789> can't<00:00:52.999> wait<00:00:53.209> until<00:00:53.479> the<00:00:53.749> optimization

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
really can't wait until the optimization

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.539 
really can't wait until the optimization
gets<00:00:54.619> to<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.859> point<00:00:55.010> where<00:00:55.129> i<00:00:55.249> can<00:00:55.399> actually

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
gets to the point where i can actually

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.549 
gets to the point where i can actually
start<00:00:55.969> recording<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.749> free<00:00:56.929> gameplay<00:00:57.289> on

I'm<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:12.390> sure<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.680> many<00:03:13.860> situations

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
I'm not sure it now in many situations

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.340 
I'm not sure it now in many situations
is<00:03:14.489> not<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.850> hard<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.120> put<00:03:15.450> them<00:03:15.720> three<00:03:16.200> or

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
is not that hard to put them three or

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.190 
is not that hard to put them three or
four<00:03:16.590> shells<00:03:16.860> into<00:03:17.100> your<00:03:17.760> target<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
four shells into your target but the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
four shells into your target but the
thing<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.380> has<00:03:19.620> threw<00:03:20.010> me<00:03:20.160> off<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> most<00:03:20.550> i

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
thing that has threw me off the most i

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.699 
thing that has threw me off the most i
would<00:03:20.910> say<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.540> actually<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.170> lightning<00:03:22.620> in

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
would say is actually the lightning in

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.470 
would say is actually the lightning in
itself<00:03:23.010> when<00:03:23.610> you're<00:03:23.730> standing<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.360> of

itself when you're standing on a bit of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.290 
itself when you're standing on a bit of
an<00:03:24.570> uneven<00:03:25.080> ground<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.709> you're<00:03:26.190> firing<00:03:26.459> your

back<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.760> forward<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.780> does<00:03:31.290> throw<00:03:31.560> my

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
back and forward and that does throw my

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
damage has been reduced quite a bit it

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.509 
damage has been reduced quite a bit it
was<00:03:48.540> quite<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> while<00:03:48.959> ago<00:03:49.140> actually<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.220> the

was quite a while ago actually but the

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.400 
was quite a while ago actually but the
the<00:03:50.850> heat<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.269> definitely<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.019> better<00:03:52.200> choice

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the heat is definitely a better choice

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.330 
the heat is definitely a better choice
for<00:03:52.590> vs

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.879 
the tank and fighting as long as I can
as<00:04:59.400> an<00:04:59.550> engineer<00:04:59.940> is<00:05:00.180> what<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.020> almost<00:05:01.620> always

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
as an engineer is what I almost always

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.969 
as an engineer is what I almost always
do<00:05:02.280> every<00:05:02.669> time<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.910> lose<00:05:03.210> my<00:05:03.560> ground<00:05:04.560> vehicle

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
do every time I lose my ground vehicle

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.950 
do every time I lose my ground vehicle
but<00:05:05.789> normally<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.150> have<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.389> cut<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.600> recording

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
but normally I have to cut the recording

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.110 
but normally I have to cut the recording
first<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:08.039> even<00:05:08.250> though<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.370> normally<00:05:08.970> play

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
first and even though I normally play

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.330 
first and even though I normally play
with<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.389> Jaguar<00:05:09.870> nowadays<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.530> actually<00:05:10.979> do

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
with the Jaguar nowadays I actually do

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.540 
with the Jaguar nowadays I actually do
think<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.539> track<00:05:12.810> 5<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.440> better<00:05:14.099> for<00:05:14.430> at

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
think that the track 5 is better for at

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.129 
think that the track 5 is better for at
least<00:05:14.700> for<00:05:14.940> me<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.240> track<00:05:15.479> 5<00:05:15.690> is<00:05:15.840> actually

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
least for me the track 5 is actually

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.870 
least for me the track 5 is actually
better<00:05:16.320> as<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.889> like<00:05:17.130> those<00:05:17.310> mid<00:05:17.639> range

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
better as I like those mid range

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.440 
better as I like those mid range
engagements<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.979> track<00:05:20.220> 5<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.820> it

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
engagements and the track 5 is just it

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.820 
engagements and the track 5 is just it
just<00:05:21.599> has<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.900> bit<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.169> an<00:05:22.289> edge<00:05:22.500> over<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
just has a bit of an edge over the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.400 
just has a bit of an edge over the
Jaguar<00:05:23.400> in<00:05:23.550> those<00:05:23.669> situations<00:05:24.240> so<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:24.870> probably

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
Jaguar in those situations so I probably

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.650 
Jaguar in those situations so I probably
am<00:05:26.070> only<00:05:26.310> going<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> use<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:26.910> gel<00:05:27.090> or<00:05:27.270> until<00:05:27.599> I

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
am only going to use the gel or until I

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.320 
am only going to use the gel or until I
get<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.960> RX<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.650> medal<00:05:28.919> for<00:05:29.099> it<00:05:29.160> which<00:05:29.669> is<00:05:29.940> I

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
get the RX a medal for it which is I

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.000 
get the RX a medal for it which is I
don't<00:05:30.690> have<00:05:30.840> all<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.080> many<00:05:31.289> orexin<00:05:31.650> metal
