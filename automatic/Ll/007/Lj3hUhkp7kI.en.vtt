00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 as is the case with the grape and hard thigh 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.330
 in the third there was some slope 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 it is important that you maintain a low vegetation 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.919
 as is the case with grass 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.429
 purpose 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 is to avoid reducing 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 you should also correct the acidity of the soil 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.390
 For this I use limestone 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.920
 and preferably 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.909
 to dolomitic limestone 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.119
 because it contains calcium and magnesium 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 The best range of ph for plants is unavoidable of 7 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.630
 soil analysis 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.010
 provides this information 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.400
 for those who can not make analyzes 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.080
 11 the medical recommendation 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.860
 diplo the tons of limestone 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.710
 Academic afternoon 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.570
 with great affection 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.690
 ten thousand square meters 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 proof it must have the following dimensions 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.010
 50 by 50 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 in minimum depth 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 of 60 centimeters 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630
 during the opening of tenders 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.710
 you must separate the ground removed both feet 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 the up part 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670
 served down 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.230
 on the bottom 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.200
 should stay on top 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.290
 and there she 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 mix organic fertilizers 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 finish real 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.690
 after all mixed 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.260
 did the tests 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 Related searches 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 planting of molt 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.640
 must occur at least 30 days after 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.690
 the fertilization 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 and you should take the following care 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.189
 know how to wash the seedlings was plastic 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.970
 with few changes 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.220
 packaging should not be removed. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.459
 Otherwise 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.689
 It will make it difficult to afp. 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.689
 root development 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.149
 during withdrawal 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.409
 take care for me no 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.959
 causes dismantling 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.849
 in total 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.649
 some changes 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.109
 we can not tolerate 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 the transmontano in all areas 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.599
 another very important point is this part of the plant 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.849
 it is the name of qom 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.289
 started to put the molt in the judgment 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.460
 this practice 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.279
 It can not be too deep. 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.089
 not very up 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.879
 if it's too deep 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.139
 provocation moment of calm 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.289
 but if you are very close 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.400
 can cause 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.359
 pests and diseases 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.359
 mainly paid moss 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 he asked 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.489
 after planting 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.089
 shower well 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.089
 to facilitate payment of the fine 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.779
 remember if 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:53.989
 that most seedlings of fruit should be planted in the season of the 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:54.959
 waters 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.499
 which in the case of the southeast 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.089
 o coren 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.319
 from October 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.120
 you should also predict 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.769
 protection from the sun 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.769
 for the case of those changes respect to entries 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.019
 after about 15 or 20 days 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.019
 this protection can be removed 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.359
 in the beginning the spacing is well in the area 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.610
 and plenty of space 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.659
 who wants 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.159
 can plant something in between 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.680
 but be careful 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.039
 these plants can not cause shading 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.580
 in their seedlings 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 and it must receive its own fertilization 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.559
 throughout the useful life of the south with the sea 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 You'll have to do some things to keep it in order. 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.230
 one of them 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.240
 is cleaning pruning 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.159
 that the withdrawal of chickens 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.110
 the debts 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.449
 which can propagate 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.349
 pests and diseases 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.919
 another procedure 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.220
 elimination 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.610
 proposed to the desired one in the case of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.219
 it must be withdrawn 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.059
 if it does not weaken 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.059
 the development of the plant 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.139
 as a cultural deal ' 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.699
 besides debureaucratizing the door 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.769
 you will also have to make the duba dreams in the plants 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.639
 and eliminate invasive plants 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.639
 through the caatinga website 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.520
 at the time of forming its format 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.080
 It's good for you to meet 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.370
 on each of the species 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.919
 Why did you decide to plant 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:43.810
 we work
