difference you can actually see the darn

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
difference you can actually see the darn
thing<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> unless<00:00:29.130> guy<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.990> white<00:00:31.260> is

this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.430> terrible<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:34.590> basically<00:00:34.829> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
this is just terrible it basically just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.979 
this is just terrible it basically just
vanishes<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:37.160> just<00:00:38.160> checked<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> dihedral<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
vanishes I just checked the dihedral and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.029 
vanishes I just checked the dihedral and
when<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.320> laying<00:00:40.590> flat<00:00:41.629> I've<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:45.379> about<00:00:46.379> two

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
when it's laying flat I've got about two

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.350 
when it's laying flat I've got about two
and<00:00:47.280> three-quarter<00:00:47.940> inches<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:49.110> evil<00:00:50.360> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and three-quarter inches the evil of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.639 
and three-quarter inches the evil of
course<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> flying<00:00:54.110> if<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.500> going

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
course when it's flying if there's going

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.170 
course when it's flying if there's going
to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.010> flecks<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> wing<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to be a little flecks in the wing of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
to be a little flecks in the wing of
course<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.840> poem<00:01:01.109> wearing<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
course the poem wearing right so it's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
course the poem wearing right so it's
going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> flex<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:07.680> sure<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.250> some

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to flex so I'm sure it's got some

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.800 
going to flex so I'm sure it's got some
more<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> difference<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.299> way<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
more but the difference in the way the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.170 
more but the difference in the way the
airplane<00:01:13.560> flies<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.780> incredible<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
airplane flies is incredible but when I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
airplane flies is incredible but when I
first<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.140> uh<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:21.170> was<00:01:22.170> basically

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
first got it it was uh it was basically

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.990 
first got it it was uh it was basically
a<00:01:22.920> flying<00:01:23.360> pig<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:25.229> quite<00:01:25.470> honest<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a flying pig be quite honest with you it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.230 
a flying pig be quite honest with you it
was<00:01:27.110> very<00:01:28.110> ill<00:01:28.439> handling<00:01:30.770> having<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.060> drill<00:01:33.060> in

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
was very ill handling having to drill in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
was very ill handling having to drill in
the<00:01:33.270> wing<00:01:34.070> made<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> huge<00:01:35.610> difference<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the wing made a huge difference the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.000 
the wing made a huge difference the
glide<00:01:36.990> ratio<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.930> better<00:01:40.430> it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.180 

it's<00:01:45.020> semi<00:01:46.020> self-righting<00:01:46.860> fountain<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.180> mild

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
it's semi self-righting fountain a mild

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.900 
it's semi self-righting fountain a mild
corner<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:51.420> turn<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:51.930> let<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.760> know

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
corner to turn it let it go it you know

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.760 
corner to turn it let it go it you know
it'll<00:01:54.120> come<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.780> level<00:01:55.110> again<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.620> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it'll come back to level again where it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.720 
it'll come back to level again where it
wouldn't<00:01:57.110> be<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.440> all<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.010> spiral

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
wouldn't be not at all and just spiral

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:09.290 
wouldn't be not at all and just spiral
in<00:01:59.910> before<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:05.450> glue<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.810> foams<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:08.910> put

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
in before the glue this foams that I put

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.110 
in before the glue this foams that I put
in<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.830> holding<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.520> flying<00:02:11.850> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in here just be holding just flying I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910 
in here just be holding just flying I
know<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.510> agree<00:02:12.750> i<00:02:12.780> haven't<00:02:13.200> repainted<00:02:13.800> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
know what I agree i haven't repainted it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.200 
know what I agree i haven't repainted it
because<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> make<00:02:14.940> sure<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
because I want to make sure that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.360 
because I want to make sure that
everything<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.130> was<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.520> work<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:20.250> know

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
everything is was going to work you know

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.700 
everything is was going to work you know
the<00:02:20.520> plane<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.910> fairly<00:02:21.780> heavy<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> lot<00:02:22.680> of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
the plane is fairly heavy I got a lot of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.340 
the plane is fairly heavy I got a lot of
gear<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:25.640> had<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.780> had<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.140> few

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
gear in it and had it had it in a few

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.530 
gear in it and had it had it in a few
dies<00:02:28.590> where<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.100> got<00:02:29.310> some<00:02:29.550> speed<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.240> put<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
dies where it's got some speed and put a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
dies where it's got some speed and put a
few<00:02:30.780> cheese<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.150> no<00:02:33.150> sign<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.840> anything

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
few cheese on it and no sign of anything

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.820 
few cheese on it and no sign of anything
letting<00:02:35.040> go<00:02:35.220> at<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.560> safe

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
letting go at all so I think the safe

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.290 
letting go at all so I think the safe
way<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.910> repair<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:41.370> made<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
way to to repair it I made it a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.140 
way to to repair it I made it a
one-piece<00:02:42.810> wing<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.340> by<00:02:44.610> choice<00:02:44.910> i

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
one-piece wing that was just by choice i

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.210 
one-piece wing that was just by choice i
don't<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.540> i<00:02:45.780> don't<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.709> had<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.010> be

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
don't think i don't think it had to be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.020 
don't think i don't think it had to be
made<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.790> one-piece<00:02:48.330> wing<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:50.010> i<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.850> thought

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
made a one-piece wing but i just thought

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.930 
made a one-piece wing but i just thought
well<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:52.110> not<00:02:52.290> big<00:02:52.560> big<00:02:52.950> deal<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.580> bodies

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
well it's not big big deal the bodies

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.780 
well it's not big big deal the bodies
that<00:02:54.120> long<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.750> who<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> not<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.010> only

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
that long so who is not that the only

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.650 
that long so who is not that the only
thing<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:00.870> still<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.269> top

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
thing that i still get to do is this top

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
can you can see it turn the corner and

you have to rock your wings back and

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.170 
you have to rock your wings back and
forth<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:47.710> flash<00:04:47.949> as<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.340> yellow<00:04:48.610> just

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
airplane that flies much better do this

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.629 
airplane that flies much better do this
modification<00:05:09.750> it's<00:05:10.750> not<00:05:11.050> hard<00:05:11.319> to<00:05:11.409> do<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:12.460> do

airplane flies it's incredible on the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680 
airplane flies it's incredible on the
next<00:05:33.840> aerobatic<00:05:34.840> machine<00:05:35.199> but<00:05:35.440> it's<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:37.150> flies

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
next aerobatic machine but it's it flies

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.620 
next aerobatic machine but it's it flies
now<00:05:38.199> instead<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.770> dogs<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.819> the<00:05:40.000> air<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
now instead of dogs to the air it

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.430 
now instead of dogs to the air it
actually<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:41.800> turns<00:05:42.250> smooth<00:05:42.819> it<00:05:43.330> doesn't<00:05:43.750> drag

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
actually it turns smooth it doesn't drag

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.040 
actually it turns smooth it doesn't drag
it<00:05:44.650> tail<00:05:47.490> if<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.759> just<00:05:49.000> cannot<00:05:49.240> tell<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:49.990> how

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
it tail if I just cannot tell you how

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.030 
it tail if I just cannot tell you how
much<00:05:50.289> better<00:05:50.590> idea

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
much better idea

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.140 
much better idea
so<00:05:53.400> take<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:55.980> half<00:05:56.980> an<00:05:57.160> hour<00:05:57.310> or<00:05:57.640> whatever<00:05:57.790> it
