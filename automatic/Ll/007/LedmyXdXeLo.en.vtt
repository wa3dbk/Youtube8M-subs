down below there if you want it to be in

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.340 
down below there if you want it to be in
Celsius<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:21.150> need<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.420> change<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.989> fast

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
Celsius you need to change that fast

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.759 
Celsius you need to change that fast
true<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.150> want<00:03:24.360> Fahrenheit<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.500> need<00:03:25.680> to

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
true if you want Fahrenheit you need to

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.430 
true if you want Fahrenheit you need to
type<00:03:25.980> foster<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.239> true<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:28.290> need<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
type foster if it has true you need to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.470 
type foster if it has true you need to
take<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.830> false<00:03:29.130> out<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.640> put<00:03:29.910> true<00:03:30.239> there

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
take the false out and put true there

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.949 
take the false out and put true there
for<00:03:31.290> Celsius<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.220> tells<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.790> which<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.360> it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
for Celsius it tells you which is we it

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.860 
for Celsius it tells you which is we it
says<00:03:34.260> change<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.220> false<00:03:35.519> or<00:03:36.180> Fahrenheit

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
says change this to false or Fahrenheit

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.940 
says change this to false or Fahrenheit
so<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> guess<00:03:37.680> they're<00:03:38.040> using<00:03:38.370> FF<00:03:38.840> ok<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.739> let<00:03:40.920> it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
so I guess they're using FF ok so let it

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.370 
so I guess they're using FF ok so let it
get<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.489> zip<00:03:41.700> code<00:03:41.750> which<00:03:42.750> will<00:03:42.780> change

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
get you your zip code which will change

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.729 
get you your zip code which will change
your<00:03:43.530> weather<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.190> your<00:03:44.880> Fahrenheit<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.870> if

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
your weather and your Fahrenheit and if

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.110 
your weather and your Fahrenheit and if
you<00:03:46.860> want<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.100> go<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.310> down<00:03:47.549> here<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.790> change

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
you want to go on down here and change

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.120 
you want to go on down here and change
the<00:03:48.450> cloth<00:03:49.350> from<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.190> 24-hour<00:03:51.090> clock<00:03:51.440> to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.920 

12-hour<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:56.940> do<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.269> then<00:03:57.510> here<00:03:57.750> as

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
12-hour you can do that then here as

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.670 
12-hour you can do that then here as
well<00:03:58.200> right<00:03:58.560> here<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.980> need<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.220> change<00:03:59.430> far

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
well right here you need to change far

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430 
well right here you need to change far
12-hour<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:02.010> true<00:04:02.390> 24-hour<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.780> false<00:04:04.140> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
12-hour is true 24-hour is false so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.650 
12-hour is true 24-hour is false so
whichever<00:04:04.890> way<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.160> want<00:04:05.489> say<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.510> can
