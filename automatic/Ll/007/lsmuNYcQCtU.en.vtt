could take this board out there it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.989 
could take this board out there it
actually<00:01:36.380> has<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> thinned<00:01:37.039> out<00:01:37.219> tail<00:01:37.670> and

thinned out nose and that gives it a

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.559 
thinned out nose and that gives it a
little<00:01:40.130> more<00:01:40.399> maneuverability<00:01:40.999> so<00:01:41.389> if<00:01:41.479> you

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.239 
kind of been intimidating they're very
cumbersome<00:01:53.479> hard<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.899> get<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.259> beach<00:01:54.469> but

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
cumbersome hard to get to the beach but

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.769 
cumbersome hard to get to the beach but
this<00:01:55.429> one's<00:01:55.609> pretty<00:01:55.789> light<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.419> also<00:01:56.599> has

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
this one's pretty light and it also has

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.649 
this one's pretty light and it also has
this<00:01:57.289> handle<00:01:58.189> right<00:01:58.399> here<00:01:58.429> which<00:01:59.209> is<00:01:59.389> built

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
this handle right here which is built

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.659 
this handle right here which is built
into<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.049> board<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:00.499> it<00:02:00.560> makes<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.189> easier<00:02:01.639> to

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:01.669 
into the board so it makes it easier to

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:03.550 
into the board so it makes it easier to
carry<00:02:02.149> down<00:02:02.419> to<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.749> beach<00:02:02.899> from<00:02:03.169> your<00:02:03.229> car

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
carry down to the beach from your car

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.529 
carry down to the beach from your car
nice<00:02:03.979> okay<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.459> in<00:02:04.700> addition<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.450> my

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
nice okay so in addition to my

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.419 
nice okay so in addition to my
paddleboard<00:02:05.990> obviously<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.770> need<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.069> paddle

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
paddleboard obviously I need a paddle

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.089 
paddleboard obviously I need a paddle
you<00:02:07.849> are<00:02:07.999> going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.270> want<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.539> paddle<00:02:08.899> yes<00:02:09.319> you

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
you are going to want a paddle yes you

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.040 
you are going to want a paddle yes you
also<00:02:10.280> want<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.670> leash<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.660> first<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
also want to leash and but first the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.740 
also want to leash and but first the
paddle<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.000> paddle<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.510> has

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
paddle so you want a paddle that has

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.990 
paddle so you want a paddle that has
kind<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.349> small<00:02:15.709> blade<00:02:16.130> which<00:02:16.489> seems<00:02:16.819> almost

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
kind of a small blade which seems almost

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.620 
kind of a small blade which seems almost
counterintuitive<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.190> c4<00:02:19.849> Waterman

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
counterintuitive but this c4 Waterman

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.540 
counterintuitive but this c4 Waterman
bamboo<00:02:21.080> paddle<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.620> has<00:02:21.800> an<00:02:21.920> eight-inch<00:02:22.400> blade

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
bamboo paddle it has an eight-inch blade

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.980 
bamboo paddle it has an eight-inch blade
which<00:02:23.120> makes<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.990> lot<00:02:24.170> easier<00:02:24.350> to

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
which makes it a lot easier to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.230 
which makes it a lot easier to
control<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.680> steer<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.970> also<00:02:27.090> a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
control and steer it's also a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.660 
control and steer it's also a
combination<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.990> carbon<00:02:28.710> fiber<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> shaft

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
combination of carbon fiber in the shaft

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
combination of carbon fiber in the shaft
there<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.270> fiberglass<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> gives

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
there and then fiberglass here it gives

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.250 
there and then fiberglass here it gives
it<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> very<00:02:31.740> strong<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.640> flexible<00:02:32.910> feel<00:02:33.540> so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it a very strong but flexible feel so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.440 
it a very strong but flexible feel so
it's<00:02:34.380> great<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:35.040> having<00:02:35.430> control<00:02:35.820> paddling

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it's great for having control paddling

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.330 
it's great for having control paddling
out<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> water<00:02:36.990> it's<00:02:37.740> very<00:02:38.040> lightweight

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
out in the water it's very lightweight

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.680 
out in the water it's very lightweight
too<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.240> going<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.420> weigh<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.570> down

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
too so it's not going to weigh you down

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.440 
too so it's not going to weigh you down
so<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> buying<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.130> paddle<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.940> should<00:02:42.270> be
