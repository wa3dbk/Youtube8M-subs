00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
shield which in there you know they're

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.300 
shield which in there you know they're
located<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.379> moon<00:01:05.590> for<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.860> most<00:01:06.100> part

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
located on the moon for the most part

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.770 
located on the moon for the most part
that<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.760> their<00:01:06.910> origin<00:01:07.090> because<00:01:07.510> they're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
that is their origin because they're

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.990 
that is their origin because they're
part<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.050> hive<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.880> know

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
part of the hive and that is a you know

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940 
part of the hive and that is a you know
the<00:01:10.210> main<00:01:10.450> type<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.140> race<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.740> you're<00:01:11.860> going

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
the main type of race that you're going

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.319 
the main type of race that you're going
to<00:01:12.010> be<00:01:12.070> fighting<00:01:12.369> against<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.909> dark<00:01:13.119> below

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
to be fighting against in the dark below

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.630 
to be fighting against in the dark below
so<00:01:14.079> that<00:01:14.110> links<00:01:14.530> directly<00:01:14.680> with<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> fact

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
so that links directly with the fact

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.280 
so that links directly with the fact
that<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.000> vex<00:01:16.180> mythic<00:01:16.509> class<00:01:16.659> might<00:01:16.900> be<00:01:17.020> good

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
that the vex mythic class might be good

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.530 
that the vex mythic class might be good
for<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> raid<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.030> tells<00:01:19.240> us<00:01:19.390> is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
for the raid and what that tells us is

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.210 
for the raid and what that tells us is
that<00:01:19.990> for<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.500> raid<00:01:20.740> you're<00:01:20.950> going<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> want

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
striker subclass it's more you know

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.759 
striker subclass it's more you know
offense<00:02:42.760> oriented<00:02:43.299> more<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> PvP<00:02:44.500> type

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
defender you can pop up that bubble

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.550 
defender you can pop up that bubble
shield<00:02:47.980> as<00:02:48.250> well<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:48.879> having<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.439> weapons<00:02:50.439> of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
light upgrade which if you don't know

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.339 
light upgrade which if you don't know
what<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.120> weapons<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.540> light<00:02:52.720> upgrade<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.140> it

what the weapons of light upgrade is it

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.619 
what the weapons of light upgrade is it
basically<00:02:53.799> increases<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:55.060> overall<00:02:55.090> attack

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.210 
basically increases the overall attack
of<00:02:55.870> your<00:02:56.019> weapons<00:02:56.379> when<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.680> walk<00:02:56.859> through<00:02:56.889> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
of your weapons when you walk through it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.349 
of your weapons when you walk through it
your<00:02:57.340> teammates<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.790> walk<00:02:58.000> through<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.239> too

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
your teammates can walk through it too

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.759 
your teammates can walk through it too
so<00:02:58.690> when<00:02:58.840> you're<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.049> big<00:02:59.260> boss<00:02:59.440> battle

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769

increases or boosts your defense but

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.869 
increases or boosts your defense but
overall<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:09.159> would<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.730> best

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
overall you know that would be the best

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.940

the Warlock subclass you're going to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.149 
the Warlock subclass you're going to
have<00:03:13.689> the<00:03:13.840> Sun<00:03:14.079> singer<00:03:14.409> subclass<00:03:14.859> build

have the Sun singer subclass build

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.339 
have the Sun singer subclass build
simply<00:03:15.879> because<00:03:16.030> sulfur<00:03:16.389> vibe<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.139> most

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
simply because sulfur vibe is the most

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.140 
simply because sulfur vibe is the most
valuable<00:03:17.769> thing<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.159> could<00:03:18.310> ever<00:03:18.340> get<00:03:18.760> from

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
can solve for vibe which is very

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.000 
can solve for vibe which is very
valuable<00:03:25.690> because<00:03:26.079> if<00:03:26.260> anyone<00:03:26.560> goes<00:03:26.739> down

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
valuable because if anyone goes down

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.890

throughout the hard rate especially the
final<00:03:29.230> boss<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.530> really<00:03:29.919> screws<00:03:30.129> things<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.669> so

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
final boss it really screws things up so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.580 
final boss it really screws things up so
that<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.269> definitely<00:03:31.599> very<00:03:31.690> valuable<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.379> have

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
solar weapons in solar grenades you're

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.420 
solar weapons in solar grenades you're
probably<00:03:43.959> not<00:03:44.169> going<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.349> have<00:03:44.470> success<00:03:44.980> but

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
probably not going to have success but

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.129 
probably not going to have success but
moving<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.000> hunter<00:03:46.389> subclass<00:03:46.810> it's

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
moving on to the hunter subclass it's

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.629 
moving on to the hunter subclass it's
going<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> gun<00:03:47.980> singer<00:03:48.280> subclass

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
going to be the gun singer subclass

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.580 
going to be the gun singer subclass
simply<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.780> grenades<00:03:50.169> would<00:03:50.349> be<00:03:50.470> the

simply because the grenades would be the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.140 
simply because the grenades would be the
best<00:03:50.769> suited<00:03:51.129> for<00:03:51.159> because<00:03:51.579> they<00:03:51.729> are<00:03:51.849> solar

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
