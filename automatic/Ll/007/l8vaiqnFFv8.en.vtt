that<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:13.459> could<00:04:13.610> have<00:04:13.730> all<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.030> chops

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
that is it you could have all the chops

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.580 
that is it you could have all the chops
in<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.480> world<00:04:14.660> but<00:04:14.900> if<00:04:14.990> you<00:04:15.020> can't<00:04:15.080> if<00:04:15.500> you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
in the world but if you can't if you

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.680 
in the world but if you can't if you
can't<00:04:15.800> make<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.070> dance<00:04:16.280> then<00:04:16.640> at<00:04:17.150> least<00:04:17.299> for<00:04:17.570> me

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
can't make it dance then at least for me

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.569 
can't make it dance then at least for me
personally<00:04:17.720> speaking<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:18.890> isn't<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:19.519> me

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
personally speaking it just isn't for me

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.759 
personally speaking it just isn't for me
I<00:04:20.000> think<00:04:20.510> chops<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.019> all<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.230> stuff<00:04:21.350> has<00:04:21.590> its

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
I think chops and all that stuff has its

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.310 
I think chops and all that stuff has its
place<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.220> super<00:04:22.610> cool<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.450> don't<00:04:24.140> know<00:04:24.200> if

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
place and super cool but I don't know if

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.930 
place and super cool but I don't know if
you<00:04:24.410> ain't<00:04:24.590> dancing<00:04:25.040> what's<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.730> point

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you ain't dancing what's the point

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.180 
you ain't dancing what's the point
indeed<00:04:26.690> that's<00:04:27.169> my<00:04:27.410> approach<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.919> kind<00:04:28.130> of

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
indeed that's my approach and kind of

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.159 
indeed that's my approach and kind of
similar<00:04:28.430> approach<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.940> life<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.900> all<00:04:30.050> about

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
similar approach to life it's all about

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.620 
similar approach to life it's all about
making<00:04:30.380> everybody<00:04:30.830> move<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.450> means

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
making everybody move if that means

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.390 
making everybody move if that means
