not not huge but goofy from the bottom
he<00:01:03.999> can't<00:01:04.239> really<00:01:04.390> see<00:01:04.659> much<00:01:04.809> other<00:01:05.019> than<00:01:05.230> his

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
he can't really see much other than his

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.710 
he can't really see much other than his
thighs<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.600> he<00:01:07.600> gets<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.960> job<00:01:07.990> done

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
thighs and he gets the job done

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.820 
thighs and he gets the job done
transformation<00:01:10.720> on<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.200> really<00:01:11.620> nicely

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
transformation on this is really nicely

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.760 
transformation on this is really nicely
done<00:01:12.130> in<00:01:12.280> my<00:01:12.400> opinion<00:01:13.410> you<00:01:14.410> can<00:01:14.440> do<00:01:14.620> this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
done in my opinion you can do this

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.040 
done in my opinion you can do this
actually<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> number<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.460> ways<00:01:15.840> we'll<00:01:16.840> start

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
actually in a number of ways we'll start

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.660 
actually in a number of ways we'll start
off<00:01:17.140> by<00:01:17.170> doing<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> legs<00:01:17.830> first<00:01:18.160> you<00:01:18.370> can<00:01:18.490> save

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
off by doing the legs first you can save

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.580 
off by doing the legs first you can save
these<00:01:18.820> for<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.150> end<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.930> fold<00:01:20.320> them<00:01:20.470> out

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
these for the end to is fold them out

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.150 
these for the end to is fold them out
and<00:01:20.890> then<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> simple<00:01:23.380> cut<00:01:23.650> swivel

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
and then this is a simple cut swivel

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.770 
and then this is a simple cut swivel
joint<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.790> been<00:01:24.910> angled<00:01:25.300> perfectly

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
joint that's just been angled perfectly

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.120 
joint that's just been angled perfectly
to<00:01:25.990> do<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.960> now<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.620> wheels<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:30.010> his

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
to do this and now the wheels on his

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.530 
to do this and now the wheels on his
heel<00:01:31.380> works<00:01:32.380> very<00:01:32.560> nicely<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.970> now<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.240> have

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
heel works very nicely and now you have

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.000 
heel works very nicely and now you have
a<00:01:34.870> goofy<00:01:35.470> looking<00:01:35.620> walking<00:01:36.280> truck<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.890> you

this back piece down now these parts you

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.740 
this back piece down now these parts you
can<00:01:54.400> just<00:01:54.640> lift<00:01:54.850> up<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.270> they'll<00:01:55.390> do<00:01:55.570> their

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
thing but I found out they're connected

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.490 
thing but I found out they're connected
via<00:01:57.970> two<00:01:58.270> black<00:01:58.510> joints<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.050> can<00:01:59.140> actually

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
via two black joints you can actually

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.770 
via two black joints you can actually
lower<00:01:59.710> by<00:02:00.010> folding<00:02:00.910> these<00:02:01.120> parts<00:02:01.480> on<00:02:01.630> there

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
lower by folding these parts on there

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.710 
lower by folding these parts on there
extremely<00:02:02.500> tight<00:02:02.800> angled<00:02:03.340> hinge<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.600> you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
extremely tight angled hinge and you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.450 
extremely tight angled hinge and you
seal<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.170> move<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.530> little<00:02:05.650> bit<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.190> then

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
seal it to move a little bit and then

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.009 
seal it to move a little bit and then
this<00:02:06.610> black<00:02:06.850> part<00:02:07.210> moves<00:02:07.450> down<00:02:07.780> which

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
this black part moves down which

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.869 
this black part moves down which
releases<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.619> arm<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:09.039> flipped<00:02:09.340> around<00:02:09.489> to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
releases the arm that flipped around to

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.460 
releases the arm that flipped around to
over<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.050> which<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:11.800> clips<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.030> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
over here which just clips in like that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.240 
over here which just clips in like that
alternatively<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.770> just<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.130> like

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
alternatively you can just do it like

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.480 
alternatively you can just do it like
this

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.670 
this
I<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.750> bit<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:18.050> autumn<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.440> if<00:02:18.530> it's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
I like that bit of autumn or if it's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.540 
I like that bit of autumn or if it's
Pleasant<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.050> see<00:02:21.110> down<00:02:21.440> here

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
Pleasant and as you can see down here

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.730 
Pleasant and as you can see down here
these<00:02:22.550> fold<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.630> angle<00:02:24.170> joint<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.680> is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
these fold on a an angle joint that is

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.670 
these fold on a an angle joint that is
viciously<00:02:25.640> tight<00:02:26.000> often<00:02:26.960> these<00:02:27.140> parts<00:02:27.530> will

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
viciously tight often these parts will

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.050 
viciously tight often these parts will
actually<00:02:27.920> pop<00:02:28.130> off<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:28.760> stick

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
actually pop off and you can just stick

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.020 
actually pop off and you can just stick
them<00:02:29.180> back<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:31.460> now<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.820> something

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
them back on so now you have something

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.460 
them back on so now you have something
that's<00:02:32.150> looking<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.420> bit<00:02:32.570> more<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.050> robot

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
that's looking a bit more like a robot

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.800 
that's looking a bit more like a robot
actually<00:02:33.800> someone<00:02:34.550> did<00:02:34.580> an<00:02:34.760> amusing<00:02:35.060> fan<00:02:35.510> mode

have OCAD you can open his fingers a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.220 
have OCAD you can open his fingers a
little<00:03:08.720> bit<00:03:08.840> there<00:03:09.020> too<00:03:09.230> now<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.660> big<00:03:11.660> crux<00:03:12.050> of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
little bit there too now the big crux of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.680 
little bit there too now the big crux of
this<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.650> can<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.250> tell<00:03:13.640> something<00:03:14.270> is<00:03:14.390> wrong

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
this is can you tell something is wrong

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.140 
this is can you tell something is wrong
with<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.050> picture<00:03:15.550> let<00:03:16.550> me<00:03:16.670> give<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> hint

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
with this picture let me give you a hint

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.720 
with this picture let me give you a hint
this<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.140> unpainted<00:03:18.650> arm<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.490> see

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
this is the unpainted arm as you can see

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.940 
this is the unpainted arm as you can see
compared<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.540> arm<00:03:20.780> notice<00:03:21.740> how<00:03:21.890> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
compared to this arm notice how the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.820 
compared to this arm notice how the
shoulder<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.670> lower<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.540> disc<00:03:23.780> inside<00:03:24.350> here

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
shoulder is lower the disc inside here

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.430 
shoulder is lower the disc inside here
is<00:03:24.950> not<00:03:25.430> simply<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.970> peg<00:03:26.330> stuck<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> disc<00:03:27.170> it's

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
is not simply a peg stuck on a disc it's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.400 
is not simply a peg stuck on a disc it's
actually<00:03:27.890> an<00:03:28.070> angled<00:03:28.970> peg<00:03:29.300> stuck<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> disc

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
actually an angled peg stuck on a disc

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.310 
actually an angled peg stuck on a disc
so<00:03:31.000> what<00:03:32.000> Hiro<00:03:32.300> did<00:03:32.540> when<00:03:32.660> he<00:03:32.690> assembled<00:03:33.200> this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
so what Hiro did when he assembled this

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.680 
so what Hiro did when he assembled this
he<00:03:33.560> gave<00:03:33.710> me<00:03:33.950> two<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.880> inner<00:03:35.420> shoulder

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
he gave me two of this inner shoulder

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.340 
he gave me two of this inner shoulder
disc<00:03:36.050> which<00:03:36.230> means<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.620> one<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:37.070> misaligned

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
disc which means this one is misaligned

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.320 
disc which means this one is misaligned
that's<00:03:39.350> really<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.280> only<00:03:40.310> effect<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.300> that

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
that's really the only effect is that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.790 
that's really the only effect is that
this<00:03:41.600> shoulders<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.170> bit<00:03:42.320> lower<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.710> the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
this shoulders a bit lower and in the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.300 
this shoulders a bit lower and in the
vehicle<00:03:43.160> mode<00:03:43.250> there's<00:03:43.460> a<00:03:43.520> gap<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.120> it's

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
vehicle mode there's a gap but it's

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.010 
vehicle mode there's a gap but it's
surprising<00:03:46.310> how<00:03:46.460> one<00:03:47.000> piece<00:03:47.270> can<00:03:47.570> cause<00:03:47.750> such

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
surprising how one piece can cause such

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.600 
surprising how one piece can cause such
an<00:03:48.200> amount<00:03:48.740> of<00:03:48.830> difference<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.370> then<00:03:49.520> again

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
an amount of difference but then again

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.450 
an amount of difference but then again
not<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.940> really<00:03:50.390> huge<00:03:50.690> amount<00:03:50.960> of<00:03:51.050> difference

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
not a really huge amount of difference

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.950 
not a really huge amount of difference
also<00:03:52.460> on<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:52.970> one<00:03:53.210> I'm<00:03:53.450> not<00:03:53.600> sure<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.840> can

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
also on this one I'm not sure if you can

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.030 
also on this one I'm not sure if you can
see<00:03:54.170> his<00:03:54.500> his<00:03:55.310> left<00:03:55.910> eye<00:03:56.210> is<00:03:56.510> not<00:03:57.440> as<00:03:57.620> painted

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
see his his left eye is not as painted

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.220 
see his his left eye is not as painted
as<00:03:58.190> his<00:03:58.370> right<00:03:58.610> eye

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
as his right eye

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.940 
as his right eye
overall<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:00.350> just<00:04:00.470> giving<00:04:00.650> me<00:04:00.800> more

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
overall it's just giving me more

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.290 
overall it's just giving me more
incentive<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.430> buy<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:01.640> one<00:04:01.970> when<00:04:02.270> it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
incentive to buy this one when it

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.300 
incentive to buy this one when it
actually<00:04:02.570> comes<00:04:02.960> out<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:04.070> I'm<00:04:04.160> gonna

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
actually comes out and then I'm gonna

this<00:04:52.640> side<00:04:52.850> no<00:04:53.090> Springs<00:04:53.450> involved<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:53.930> is

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
this side no Springs involved this is

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.530 
this side no Springs involved this is
all<00:04:54.200> pressure<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.460> production<00:04:55.970> one<00:04:56.120> one

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
all pressure on the production one one

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.600 
all pressure on the production one one
other<00:04:56.660> thing<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.200> figure<00:04:57.470> has<00:04:57.800> no<00:04:58.040> screws

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
other thing is this figure has no screws

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.820 
other thing is this figure has no screws
here<00:04:59.240> because<00:04:59.690> here<00:04:59.900> Oh<00:04:59.930> forgot<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.590> get<00:05:00.710> any

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
here because here Oh forgot to get any

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.800 
here because here Oh forgot to get any
paint<00:05:01.070> or<00:05:01.250> screws<00:05:01.610> on<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:01.910> part<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> actually

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
paint or screws on this part I actually

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.420 
paint or screws on this part I actually
cannibalized<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.560> screw<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.950> put<00:05:04.100> in<00:05:04.220> there

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
cannibalized a screw to put in there

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.580 
cannibalized a screw to put in there
from<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:05.600> arm<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:06.260> this<00:05:06.410> thing

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
from this arm just so this thing

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.990 
from this arm just so this thing
wouldn't<00:05:06.830> flop<00:05:07.070> all<00:05:07.250> over<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.550> place<00:05:07.730> cuz

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
wouldn't flop all over the place cuz

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 
wouldn't flop all over the place cuz
it's<00:05:08.150> all<00:05:08.270> friction<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.960> inside<00:05:09.260> but<00:05:09.440> this

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
it's all friction on the inside but this

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.440 
it's all friction on the inside but this
will<00:05:10.130> probably<00:05:10.250> be<00:05:10.430> tighter<00:05:10.820> on<00:05:11.120> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
will probably be tighter on the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.750 
will probably be tighter on the
production<00:05:11.990> piece<00:05:12.290> this<00:05:13.070> lever<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.550> just

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
production piece this lever you just

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.020 
production piece this lever you just
kind<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:13.970> fold<00:05:14.750> out<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:16.490> fire<00:05:16.760> his

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
kind of fold out and you fire his

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.570 
kind of fold out and you fire his
wrecking<00:05:17.900> ball<00:05:18.170> which<00:05:18.920> is<00:05:18.950> attached<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.490> a

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
wrecking ball which is attached to a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.450 
wrecking ball which is attached to a
built<00:05:19.850> in<00:05:20.030> string<00:05:20.420> it's<00:05:20.740> I'm<00:05:21.740> gonna<00:05:21.950> say<00:05:22.250> it's

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
built in string it's I'm gonna say it's

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.740 
built in string it's I'm gonna say it's
not<00:05:22.550> hard<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:23.000> reload<00:05:23.330> but<00:05:23.510> then<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.660> can

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
not hard to reload but then you can

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.060 
not hard to reload but then you can
watch<00:05:23.900> me<00:05:24.110> struggle<00:05:24.290> with<00:05:24.560> this<00:05:24.680> but<00:05:24.920> I<00:05:24.950> do

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
watch me struggle with this but I do

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.400 
watch me struggle with this but I do
think<00:05:25.730> it's<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.210> easier<00:05:26.570> to<00:05:26.810> reload<00:05:27.170> this

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
think it's it's easier to reload this

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.380 
think it's it's easier to reload this
string<00:05:27.740> than<00:05:27.950> other<00:05:28.580> string<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.360> have

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
string than other string I have

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.760 
string than other string I have
encountered<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.140> figures<00:05:30.560> such<00:05:30.740> as

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
encountered on figures such as

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.770 
encountered on figures such as
tarantulas<00:05:31.430> because<00:05:31.730> see<00:05:32.390> how<00:05:32.480> there's<00:05:32.660> these

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
tarantulas because see how there's these

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.390 
tarantulas because see how there's these
nubs<00:05:33.170> on<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.560> bottom<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:33.980> wrecking<00:05:34.280> ball

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
nubs on the bottom of the wrecking ball

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.890 
nubs on the bottom of the wrecking ball
they<00:05:34.520> kind<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:34.760> just<00:05:34.880> push<00:05:35.270> everything<00:05:35.600> in

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
they kind of just push everything in

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.550 
they kind of just push everything in
there<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:37.420> yeah<00:05:38.420> he's<00:05:38.570> he's<00:05:38.720> quite<00:05:38.990> poseable

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
there and yeah he's he's quite poseable

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.090 
there and yeah he's he's quite poseable
on<00:05:39.740> his<00:05:40.070> legs<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.520> such<00:05:40.790> although<00:05:42.040> you're<00:05:43.040> not

on his legs and such although you're not
really<00:05:43.310> gonna<00:05:43.460> need<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.820> use<00:05:44.060> them<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.420> much

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
really gonna need to use them that much

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
you can also make him do a handstand

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.630 
you can also make him do a handstand
because<00:05:47.270> his<00:05:47.480> his<00:05:48.440> his<00:05:48.770> arms<00:05:49.220> are<00:05:49.430> like

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
but he's a very nice toy now the only

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.740 
but he's a very nice toy now the only
problem<00:06:05.120> is<00:06:05.510> he's<00:06:06.320> very<00:06:06.890> bulky<00:06:07.750> unfortunately

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
problem is he's very bulky unfortunately

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.400 
problem is he's very bulky unfortunately
he's<00:06:09.350> not<00:06:09.560> very<00:06:09.770> tall<00:06:10.690> he's<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.780> little<00:06:11.990> dwarfed

by<00:06:12.710> most<00:06:13.400> Deluxe's<00:06:14.120> in<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.480> line<00:06:14.690> he's<00:06:14.960> much

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
by most Deluxe's in this line he's much

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.560

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
but I believe lugnut suffers from this

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.780 
but I believe lugnut suffers from this
as<00:06:20.300> well<00:06:20.510> which<00:06:21.050> does<00:06:21.350> put<00:06:21.650> bulkhead<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.580> lug

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790
