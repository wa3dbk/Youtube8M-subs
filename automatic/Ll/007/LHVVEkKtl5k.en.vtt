00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 the eighth in the world the game was a video, right? 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.460
 photographing only a video with my 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.219
 camera in the usual you are already 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 accustomed to a camera called lumix 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.340
 f75 and the collection used no deputy is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 the one I used to take mine 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 videos in the channel start over 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.090
 complete company only that my 13 said 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 will not take today not because it is in the top 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 not aggravating but I believe that the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 problem is the memory card because 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 the memory card has not recorded either 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.469
 on this camera then 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.120
 so it's complicated then 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 The memory card prompts you to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 wheel and this camera is not the same as 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 in my thesis because 300 years ago 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.270
 a speed 10 e and if it does not return to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 there you are buying something called 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.079
 improve my god 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
 besides then if one hurts too much 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.230
 Of course very dark I do not know why I do not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 I can see why you do not have a neighbor. 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 but calm people who will soon pack the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 draw more of it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.830
 Another thing I want to talk about is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 so you use it as long as you just know if 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.030
 play now at the beginning of the video you do not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 need to make known 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 I know you forget to give it to me 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.409
 You did not watch the video until the end. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.930
 Last 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.290
 so if you come to play now do not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
 need more prove partners 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.070
 quietly and once again will ask 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.310
 Sorry for the video quality and the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 I audition for everything and that's what I'll get 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 we show my favorites I want 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.880
 This video is very good. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.759
 my palette of which two is is not the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.220
 palette that I am my word to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.579
 the palette that my favorite is a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 shadow of her daughter who calls herself an actress who 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.899
 it's a shadow of a lot of use in my 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 eyebrow and I adore exactly tona 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.490
 In this Brasilia I think it's super mom. 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 another favorite is a shadow also not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.250

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 ney what also is the colors 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.439
 I'm dancing now, you're a shadow. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 illuminating and I like me now that I 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.689
 had were from my eye i think about her 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.480
 you are who are getting 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.230
 see proteam on top of your can 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.780
 the favorite is these cotton destinations 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.580
 a very decision year whenever I 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 I showed you some favorite because 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 I love you very much and they come in these aquino and 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 God is here in the most prey so is 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.870
 Very good, I love to take off the makeup. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.060
 It's wonderful to have a nail so it was 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.180
 favorite of himself and of several months 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.950
 pass the favorite is this 20 cream 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.720
 depilatory for the face 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950
 it is obvious that some in some periods 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.129
 who does not like the face 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.680
 I do not advise eyebrows but you 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.410
 You have skill like you can go but 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.750
 was the favorite of this month of August the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.959
 favorite this month was the reason for the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.420
 caprice colors of the apothecary and objective 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.239
 well clear well fall into a well corrective 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.989
 weak and left here for you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.930
 they will read 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.140
 he is well such thing he is very weak 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.780
 He comes to light and not to leave 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.690
 that tired skin look but he 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.480
 It's not very strong, he's not there. 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.480
 to fulfill the role of illuminating and not 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.310
 leave that pink cape like this but not 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.959
 asking much and is legal for use on a 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.569
 day so I used a lot in this best 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.940
 costly agents were two good lipsticks 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.079
 called flash it it's the milani 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.660
 I do not know the color 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.859
 in the cornea flashes 02 I believe 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.319
 Be this and a lipstick people in a kadett 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.569
 and a pen pencil like that and that's it 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.209
 almost super black and purple running pretty 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.160
 and I used a lot this month and another button 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.319
 That I used a lot was the wine on the can 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.549
 berenice that this thing too 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.609
 Wonderful 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.349
 it is known that they kill the they are well 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.690
 similar to lyon and zÃ© 2000 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.930
 milani it looks just like one more 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.510
 cream and another more favorite was 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.970
 this shorty here and turn chico already 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.069
 in the first months for you is what 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.019
 save because they will be the two are the same 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.699
 then this little girl was certainly the 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.250
 future of ascendancy 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.400
 Oh how I love how I use it as I love it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.769
 then you are almost not aware and two others 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.350
 favorites will finish the work of this 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.570
 December was the wizard of oz 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.080
 This issue is on the radio, people are not. 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.370
 very cute and I made a video of the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.290
 books and dos do be hall - a gol logo 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 attack in office do not check right 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.060
 What I said about this book but I 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.790
 I loved Mexico and today I'm going to show a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.830
 film called mechanical orange 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.850
 Yes I already read the book I already told about the book. 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.140
 here for you 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.480
 Only I had never seen the movie 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.300
 believes in this and went to college 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.130
 I chose to speak to him to talk about 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.850
 about the mechanical orange my friend 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.100
 Vanessa 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.950
 I see that I know we will resist 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.110
 but he is interested in listening, I love it 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.710
 to contest the movie is not a movie 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.020
 very good is helping to unravel this 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.410
 prepared for stronger things to see 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.690
 this movie in the end that the context of the movie 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.150
 I really liked the river and only our 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.950
 Favorites same Elias hope you 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.710
 liked and did not want to 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.270
 too much damage for the camera and everything else 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.580
 I hope you have really enjoyed this 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.580
 take care and until the next
