along the years I'm not sure why but you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.609 
along the years I'm not sure why but you
can<00:00:23.640> find<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> circuit<00:00:24.330> both<00:00:24.539> under<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.199> name

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
can find the circuit both under the name

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.029 
can find the circuit both under the name
of<00:00:25.800> LC<00:00:26.340> Rojo<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.840> other<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> Caliente

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
orchid is pretty compact as you can see
it's<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.470> big<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's not really big and also the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's not really big and also the
pseudobulbs<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.580> go<00:01:11.580> pretty<00:01:11.939> plump<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pseudobulbs kind of go pretty plump but

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.420 
pseudobulbs kind of go pretty plump but
they're<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.290> huge<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> massive

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they're not huge it's not a massive

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.300 
they're not huge it's not a massive
orchid<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.350> flowers<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:16.950> pretty

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
orchid and also the flowers are pretty

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.880

tiny<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> SOI<00:01:19.470> kid<00:01:19.710> can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
tiny as you can see but the SOI kid can

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
tiny as you can see but the SOI kid can
produce<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.310> cluster<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> many<00:01:21.689> many<00:01:21.930> flowers

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
produce a cluster of many many flowers

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
produce a cluster of many many flowers
and<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.770> grown<00:01:23.130> correctly<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.810> good

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and if grown correctly and in good

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190 
and if grown correctly and in good
conditions<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.040> produce<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> 18<00:01:27.869> low

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
conditions it can produce up to 18 low

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.550 
conditions it can produce up to 18 low
flowers<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.970> imagine<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.560> now

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
flowers like these so imagine that now

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.530 
flowers like these so imagine that now
my<00:01:31.740> particular<00:01:32.159> orchid<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.820> purchased<00:01:33.240> last

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
my particular orchid was purchased last

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.679 
my particular orchid was purchased last
year<00:01:34.020> didn't<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> brilliant<00:01:35.820> root<00:01:36.240> system

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
year didn't have a brilliant root system

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
year didn't have a brilliant root system
I<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> forced<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> cut<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> lot<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.070> roots

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I was forced to cut a lot of the roots

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
I was forced to cut a lot of the roots
but<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> made<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> full<00:01:39.509> recovery<00:01:39.540> she's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> very

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
but it made a full recovery she's a very

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.789 
but it made a full recovery she's a very
Hardy<00:01:41.130> orchid<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.810> yeah<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.960> didn't<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.590> what

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this was until it bloomed as the person

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
this was until it bloomed as the person
who<00:01:47.310> sold<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> me<00:01:48.180> only<00:01:48.299> said<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.840> an

now<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.740> SOI<00:02:27.010> kid<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.490> used<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.150> many<00:02:28.950> crosses

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
now the SOI kid was used in many crosses

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.250 
now the SOI kid was used in many crosses
Kalia<00:02:30.340> crosses<00:02:30.820> because<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.570> red<00:02:31.870> color

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
Kalia crosses because of this red color

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.650 
Kalia crosses because of this red color
and<00:02:32.620> also<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.190> have<00:02:33.460> read<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.030> previous

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and also I have read that previous

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.040 
and also I have read that previous
hybrids<00:02:35.190> used<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.460> be<00:02:36.880> taller<00:02:37.240> they<00:02:37.690> used<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
hybrids used to be taller they used to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.350 
hybrids used to be taller they used to
send<00:02:38.290> out<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.500> taller<00:02:39.010> flower<00:02:39.430> spike<00:02:39.850> than<00:02:40.150> this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
send out a taller flower spike than this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.600 
send out a taller flower spike than this
but<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> newer<00:02:41.320> hybrids<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.010> actually<00:02:42.400> more

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
but the newer hybrids are actually more

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.150 
but the newer hybrids are actually more
compact<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.420> probably<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.350> new<00:02:44.860> hybrid

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
compact so probably I have a new hybrid

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.030 
compact so probably I have a new hybrid
also<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.120> older<00:02:46.390> hybrids<00:02:46.840> tended<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.680> have<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
also the older hybrids tended to have a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.230 
also the older hybrids tended to have a
darker<00:02:48.610> red<00:02:48.790> shade<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.510> them<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:51.150> regards<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
darker red shade to them in regards to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.210 
darker red shade to them in regards to
the<00:02:52.480> new<00:02:52.660> hybrids<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.530> an<00:02:53.710> orangish

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220
