00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
travels around that radius okay now I

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.950 
travels around that radius okay now I
have<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.260> bottom<00:00:43.059> nice<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.090> fair<00:00:44.510> nice<00:00:44.750> and

smooth I'm gonna draw the top compass
everything<00:00:48.440> comes<00:00:48.680> off<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:49.010> bottom<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:49.610> I'm

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030

going to draw the top line I have my top

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.579 
going to draw the top line I have my top
line<00:00:51.650> mark<00:00:51.890> here<00:00:52.220> I<00:00:52.370> mark<00:00:53.059> that<00:00:53.089> earlier<00:00:53.629> and

I have my top line marked out on my

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.830 
I have my top line marked out on my
straight<00:01:06.500> stub<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.550> now<00:01:07.700> I'm<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:08.030> gonna<00:01:08.150> go

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
straight stub and now I'm just gonna go

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.899 
straight stub and now I'm just gonna go
as<00:01:09.080> far<00:01:09.350> as<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.800> go<00:01:10.070> until<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.550> run<00:01:10.760> out<00:01:10.820> of

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
as far as I can go until I run out of

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.580 
as far as I can go until I run out of
wood<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.750> know<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> top<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:13.190> here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
wood and I know that the top is in here

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.810 
wood and I know that the top is in here
it<00:01:15.590> doesn't<00:01:15.619> matter<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.490> wood<00:01:16.700> is

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
it doesn't matter that this wood is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.990 
it doesn't matter that this wood is
missing<00:01:17.180> here<00:01:17.479> because<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:19.190> profile<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.820> my

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
missing here because the profile of my

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.350 
missing here because the profile of my
rail<00:01:20.800> disappears<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:22.250> here<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.060> know<00:01:23.150> as

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
rail disappears in here so I know as

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.760 
rail disappears in here so I know as
long<00:01:23.509> as<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.659> have<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:23.990> much<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.470> top<00:01:24.650> of

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
long as I have this much of the top of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.149 
long as I have this much of the top of
the<00:01:24.860> rail<00:01:25.040> in<00:01:25.220> here<00:01:25.430> I'm<00:01:25.790> all<00:01:26.030> set

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
the rail in here I'm all set

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.999 
the rail in here I'm all set
next<00:01:28.159> step<00:01:28.369> take<00:01:28.720> my<00:01:29.720> grinder<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.320> grind<00:01:30.770> this

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
next step take my grinder and grind this

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:47.410 
next step take my grinder and grind this
down<00:01:31.280> all<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.450> way<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.840> level<00:01:33.080> here

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.880 

it<00:01:48.420> carves<00:01:48.750> us<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> go

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it carves us down a little bit and go

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:18.020 
it carves us down a little bit and go
from<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> plane<00:01:50.550> down<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.420> plane

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.310 

look<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> from<00:02:19.450> different<00:02:19.510> directions<00:02:20.200> and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
look at it from different directions and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.630 
look at it from different directions and
make<00:02:20.470> sure<00:02:20.620> everything's<00:02:21.010> slowly<00:02:21.340> nice

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
make sure everything's slowly nice

00:02:21.640 --> 00:04:16.210 
make sure everything's slowly nice
smooth<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.890> graceful

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.430

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
okay a lot of guys will take their bit

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.370 
okay a lot of guys will take their bit
the<00:04:20.220> carving<00:04:20.609> bit<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.180> carve<00:04:21.690> around<00:04:21.900> in

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the carving bit and just carve around in

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.830 
the carving bit and just carve around in
here<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.600> you're
