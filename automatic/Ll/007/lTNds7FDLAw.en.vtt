00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
use that string it's not going to waste
and<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> sort<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and what you're going to do is sort of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300 
and what you're going to do is sort of
weave<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.060> through<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.840> loops<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.100> back

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
weave it through the loops on the back

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.639 
weave it through the loops on the back
side<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.909> turkey<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:07.259> little

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
side of the turkey so there's little

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
side of the turkey so there's little
loops<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.099> we've<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.399> made<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> you'll

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
loops that we've just made and you'll

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.450 
loops that we've just made and you'll
see<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.300> under<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> around<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:11.599> then<00:02:12.599> under

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
see I go under and around and then under

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.550 
see I go under and around and then under
and<00:02:15.040> around<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.690> then<00:02:17.690> I'll<00:02:17.780> pull<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.020> right

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and around and then I'll pull it right

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.200 
and around and then I'll pull it right
around<00:02:18.800> oh<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> last<00:02:22.100> loop<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.880> under

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
around oh this is the last loop so under

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.630 
around oh this is the last loop so under
and<00:02:23.360> around<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.960> then<00:02:24.470> right<00:02:24.770> around<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.220> end

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and around and then right around the end

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
and around and then right around the end
and<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.720> will<00:02:26.780> tie<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:28.240> squarely<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.690> my

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and I will tie it squarely to my

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.860 
and I will tie it squarely to my
original<00:02:30.980> source<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> original<00:02:32.630> knot

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
original source to the original knot

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.070 
original source to the original knot
that<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.410> made<00:02:33.880> when<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.000> first<00:02:35.300> started<00:02:35.810> let's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
that I made when we first started let's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960 
that I made when we first started let's
high<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.320> very<00:02:36.530> tightly<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.340> there<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:37.940> have

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
high it very tightly and there you have

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.420 
high it very tightly and there you have
it<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.450> hang<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.200> smoker<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.890> can

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it I can hang this in the smoker I can

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
it I can hang this in the smoker I can
cut<00:02:40.670> off<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> excess<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:42.110> roast<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
cut off the excess and I can roast the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.090 
cut off the excess and I can roast the
piece

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
piece

here's turkey breast I've taken two
turkey<00:02:45.320> breasts<00:02:45.709> push<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.610> together<00:02:46.790> and

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
turkey breasts push them together and

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.760 
turkey breasts push them together and
tied<00:02:47.480> them<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.810> same<00:02:48.050> way<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.260> could<00:02:48.620> put

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
tied them the same way you could put

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.290 
tied them the same way you could put
herbs<00:02:49.070> all<00:02:49.340> through<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.670> center<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.180> you

herbs all through the center of it you

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.820 
herbs all through the center of it you
could<00:02:50.420> season<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:50.870> various<00:02:51.230> things<00:02:51.470> this
