00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.170
 for maÃ±ama central 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.690
 with the screen starts as simple as three clicks or the person 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 here I get the flames that others have done to me 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.389
 text messages 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.669
 and for a touch with a single click cost of the text message 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 it was as simple as this by writing a text that we have and keyboard 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.630
 QWERTY 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
 hundreds of years 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.950
 which is in Spanish in its for example but with activity 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.260
 it's not a guy 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.090
 However, I do not know, I suppose it's a matter of habit 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.560
 ee min with a few ratios and eat him having little thing that operating then in 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.250
 a space place of the m 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.790
 and I was again 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.750
 ees knew that it is a matter of custom yes no then one 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.610
 use and typical 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 he's like the two of them and that's two of the guitars 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.350
 percent 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.540
 I'm so sorry that pacemaker that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.500
 This is a matter of taste 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 we have another method buried 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800
 nick westcott and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.820
 complete ponce the qwerty 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 laugh screen russia 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.940
 but with the problem is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.400
 could not know when and how to do so 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.150
 it is not honest this chair obligatorily touch with a help 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 and the third entry method is the traditional one 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.110
 that this segment after the traditional that is the jaguar keyboard keyboard 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 I was running doctor who would be a little 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 and the one of all life 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 this what I like about this is that it has 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.800
 percent and lic 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.750
 in principle thing that I do not know is if I had not found a juncture 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 - you want that there was never with this dry tone 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 as they see so as to suggest a word 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.559
 sacyr what messi you are fantastic 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.119
 I have felt 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.119
 these three 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.599
 and the fourth entrance myth 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.909
 What is it 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.419
 of this earthquake 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.419
 handwriting 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 the hand that is not clear why is it 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.649

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.429

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.289
 gnomeo well 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.509
 they can not point to the network as a myth writes 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.509
 ipys I think it's more tembleque 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.209
 to delve into this because the truth 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.009
 the truth I have problems with the inhuman recognizes me you touch teach 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.409
 then I think we won more highlighted application 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.119
 and down the ians agency 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.389
 they do not go well 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.389
 nick shopping for the remains that was here 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.019
 what I wanted to show you in apopa sitges 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.110
 with the beckham screen not just the psychic face of the person who 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.939
 I want to call 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.939

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:50.389
