 great the Colombian cycling will walk

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.910
 this time that in signal as it is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.789
 How nice it is that this great 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 runner that is being tested for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 back to spain where is in this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.119
 moment don Carlos at this time of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 eastern team over here coming to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.350
 keep but with a friend and a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.780
 companion 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 good as health goes as it feels 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 to face the Spanish round 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.600
 go a little better already starting little to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600
 shortly after 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.030
 It has affected me a lot but I think that 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.100
 we are going little by little to arrive in the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.160
 last condition to return to Spain not 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.089
 very good but good as I said 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.450
 get a little better of the year stop but 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.580
 wait on purpose of that don carlos 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.190
 betancourt arrive in optimal conditions 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.780
 at least for what it lacks 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.130
 preparation take it in that first 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.690
 Week returned Spain 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.350
 nothing and now that they go a little bit the same 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.030
 a return to spain 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.680
 I believe that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.290
 much more level than in the tour of 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.750
 France I do not think it's a career 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 difficult but I think we're going to get 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.800
 well and I'll leave it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 of the last week to try to do 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.549
 some layer through the mountains to trace 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 an important thing 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.939
 We are pleased with the sincerity of Carlos 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 bananito betancor says he is not in the 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.630
 best condition at this time that is going to 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.600
 retake some form and on the return 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.880
 Spain and that is fighting a stage not 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.040
 let your name go to the floor 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.380
 because he is a man who has palmarés 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.869
 important has very dear history in 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.750
 the world's cycling and it's good that he 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.030
 with sincerity it is manifesting it and already 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 carlitos for your condition what is your 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.150
 health problem what was it 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.150
 it was during the last months 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.040
 it infects the field a bit then 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.770
 obviously that kept me in fever 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.810
 constant and very weak and that's why the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.630
 recovery was from three months to a year 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.370
 more or less and very prepared me that you 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.980
 bártoli al also gave him when he was 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.440
 broker and euro recovery more or 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.060
 minus five months I did it in three 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.760
 meters because it gives of himself riding in 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.640
 bicycle and good but there are many 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.980
 want to be good again to return to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.099
 to be 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.599
 at a competitive level on how to 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.980
 find the mood carlo 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.440
 after all these difficulties 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.060
 after all the inconveniences of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.190
 some drawbacks also by 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.730
 understanding with your ag2r team 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.069
 how are you in the mood to face 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.069
 this round spain I think that 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.280
 you have to be a very person 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.380
 transparent 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 the team has had 2,000 agents 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.330
 with me because to escarrer doing what 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.709
 they wanted it to be fine not what 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.790
 he was and had to be fine and 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.709
 obviously for me, my health is first 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.709
 and well I think that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.030
 you enjoyed a lot but good for 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.900
 environment in Europe does not end here or in 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.950
 the ag2r I think the story continues 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.120
 and I think with the help of so much what 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.110
 come right now 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.549
 bayern to leave a good legacy as 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.930
 Colombian according to his words carlos da 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.120
 to understand that you will not continue 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.520
 next season in this team 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.020
 French 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.570
 I will not have it yet I can not 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.620
 from a place to put it that way but good 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.620
 I think it is 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.110
 with my team where we were well 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.240
 when the nice paris comes 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.239
 they were happy when they won or they were 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.250
 happy afterwards they made me run 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.860
 the classics obliged qualified 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.509
 I had to do the island 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.660
 they wanted me to do the tour of france 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:33.510
 also bound and I told them first 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.440
 I also spoke with my manager I have another 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.980
 why 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.870
 doctors that he was in good condition 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.650
 that every two or three days that I 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.650
 presented then well I think that hand 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.330
 is a team that does not understand the runner 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.949
 when he won they were happy and in the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.460
 moment that was the support of his fans 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.370
 they also made a problem of a 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.759
 vision and I'm also right but 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:09.090
 good more but not more controversial because the 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:11.669
 I really did not have the public I connect 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.219
 with me but well I think that the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.960
 history in europe continues with him the 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.990
 people recognized here it is clear that yes 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.849
 of course yes and carlos of course 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.979
 every day is matured every day you learn 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.590
 more will be things that remain in the 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.300
 inventory in experience and by 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.090
 course you are very young you have 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 a lot of cycling ahead that's what 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.620
 we want in colombia in colombia what 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.569
 we clothed in colombia we admired what 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.460
 we appreciate and we want it and have 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.259
 our support I speak on behalf of the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.229
 Colombians what grief took the spokesman 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.419
 but be assured that 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.490
 Cycling fans all 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.949
 Colombians will always be protecting what 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.350
 and of course will be supporting him in 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.600
 here on that 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.180
 When you make a mistake, you recognize it very 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.570
 well it 's a matter of moving forward and 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.330
 has all our support or carlitos 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.710
 first time you get that many of the 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.710
 people who criticize me people 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.570
 the fine to mount it and it has clearly 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.730
 little time but really it's very 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.410
 inclusive to people who do not criticize me 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.320
 but the people we know of cycling 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.700
 and the people who know that they help us in the 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.700
 half team they know 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.000
 and well I have a lot to thank 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.860
 as I say it 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.980
 in history in europe continues with a 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.780
 help of the blessed rite give 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.910
 many many joys to this effort 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.390
 Colombian that we really are 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.490
 giving many are enjoying it a lot 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.490
 for me to have been in the south 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.890
 It has also been a serious thing because I 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.490
 I think it's where a runner graduates 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.800
 and living there 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.970
 the runners are there forward that 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.970
 they are runners that are in the 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.280
 races disputing with me is 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.680
 disputing careers with them then 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.900
 it's hard for me to see it 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.120
 television you be of the season 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.530
 low has the illusion of product of 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.520
 participate which point apparatus 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.240
 dump the threads are few 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.639
 and it does not help Carlos Mario Jaramillo has 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.620
 said that I am less than one 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.949
 preselection 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:32.819
 well then be happy about that 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:34.770
 because I know that with the help of after 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:38.599
 of the return to Spain 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.599
 I will get well to the culture
