00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 to be a model is a job that makes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.259
 dream but frankly apart from doing the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.059
 beautiful and strutting around the creators 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 will be celebrating is nothing 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.960
 to find out more I asked for a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 casting girl their opinion if they are 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.510
 there they must know well not 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.590
 fairly represented 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.590
 maps and have hurt 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.610
 yes but still it's hard anyway 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.680
 would not say like that but 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.029
 it's not easy but after that it's 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.510
 pleasure also his jewels and a passion 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.090
 so that's almost it's a 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.370
 responsibility because it's a lot 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.050
 aesthetic that is to say that is 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.890
 our physique that ultimately counts it 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.570
 must also have a 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.970
 personality strong enough because that's 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.080
 a medium that is quite complicated and the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.720
 job often it's very ephemeral 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.110
 exactly in fact being a model that's 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.160
 to have an irreproachable lifestyle 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.350
 it's like a top athlete 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 that is to say, you have to be at the top of your 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.650
 form at the top of his health maintain his 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 body one has to be 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.270
 you have to be very punctual 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 you have to be very motivated you have to be 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 to be good workers admit 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 I want to try my luck yeah good 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.620
 with their endless legs and their 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.660
 boils all mimi is not won for 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.940
 me but let's admit what are the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.270
 qualities that I must have of course then 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.130
 2072 it will take a slender silhouette 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.800
 harmonious you have to be motivated 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.540
 it is necessary 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.130
 you have to be very photogenic necessarily 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.800
 it feels to care primordial beauty 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.020
 natural photogeny of course the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.170
 silhouette the harmony the harmony of the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 body but also the maturity and the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.970
 mental and motivation and will have to have a 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.860
 subtle something more that goes 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.810
 make all the difference okay and 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 to be a little more precise how 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.990
 are chosen the finalists of the casting 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.890
 elite for example we'll see how 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.730
 she behaves 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.230
 how are they going to be facing us 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.310
 they will appear before the jury 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.980
 how are they going to work 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.540
 for males will pose in photo and that's 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.400
 these little sides of their passes the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.450
 feature for example because 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.860
 that they will be comfortable 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.420
 they're going to be a little bit funny is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.969
 what it will be reserved for the kidneys 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.379
 closed well let's do as if I had everything 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.550
 what you need personally 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.269
 do not stop telling you that I am 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.370
 photogenic 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.099
 does that mean what's really good or 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 not then photogeny is the way 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.910
 whose face game will reflect the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.880
 light ie and better server 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.220
 some facial features cheekbones 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 the jaws the nose the eyes that go 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 stand out in a certain way in the face of the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.620
 light and facing the lens 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.750
 so this is for example the girl 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.459
 is very very beautiful in real life and in photo 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.349
 mh not to be photogenic 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.209
 or else on the contrary a girl is going 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.430
 go unnoticed maybe in real and in 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.140
 photo there is going to be a system of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 little magic effect that will come out 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.250
 and that's the photogeny 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.020
 it does not work it's really 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 a quality that we have or not to be 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.750
 mannequin not easy all that but I 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.370
 say one thing 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.560
 even the most polluted dummies do 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 are not perfect so you make 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.940
 how do you girls with your faults 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.890
 I do not hide it management but 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.800
 Yves yves fires is naturally and then 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.730
 if it works, I 'll try it so much better 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.620
 also put them forward 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.410
 if it can be a benefit here play to 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.100
 I assume them 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.980
 without lifting 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.750
