00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.350
 well no city 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.349

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.519
 this fourth-year student of industrial design bachelor 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.409
 i 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.340
 I am 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.779
 I want to work on composting 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 percent that is the use of waste 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.140
 Hi Nicolas 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.100
 that enter the sanitary facility as to make fertilizers and fertilizers to the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.350
 basically precept land would be located in the reserve if possible 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.410
 i the case should be reduced the neighbors who enter the same 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.910
 increasing the reserve capacity and obviously its useful life between sectors 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.109
 can go hand in hand with the program creating awareness 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.850
 I know that those are percent and encouraging the collection of waste 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.750
 in a separated way 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 and this may favor the initial work of 300 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.810
 where the important thing is that the receipt is as clean as possible 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.200
 to the scene so that the initial separation task is for 100 more 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.020
 lightweight 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.820
 composting as such 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 percent be destined 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 alex nurseries was the final without function the volume percent and be generated between 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.290
 this sector to work with the inti or with different organisms 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.390
 queer adam programs like for example but it was late and so on
