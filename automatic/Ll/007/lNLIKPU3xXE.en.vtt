00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.750
 mitsubishi electric modern solution 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.549
 in energy production 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.500
 how harmless to the environment 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.539
 environment and energy saving can be 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.799
 modern heating systems visually 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.480
 demonstrates new technology 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.250
 mitsubishi electric zubadan 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.529
 used in heat pumps 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.750
 using air as a source 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.490
 heat this unique system extracts 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.829
 thermal energy from atmospheric air 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.829
 and allows you to use it to heat 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.599
 water and space heating system 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.919
 heat pump is so efficient 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.230
 what works even in the coldest 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.410
 winter days when temperatures reach 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.180
 marks minus 25 degrees celsius important 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.310
 role in maintaining consistently high 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.200
 heat pump efficiency plays 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.910
 defrost mode because strong 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.740
 heat exchanger icing 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.390
 may lead to lower production 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.700
 heat energy is needed as much as possible 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.720
 more quickly eliminate ice for this system 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.060
 goes on mode 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.890
 defrost due to which provides 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.630
 maximum efficiency and continuous 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.760
 heat supply system zubadan 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.110
 produced by mitsubishi electric passed 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.940
 the most serious test 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 frost indicators 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.850
 defrosts were thorough 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.439
 fixed and studied in 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.109
 cutting-edge test 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.670
 mitsubishi electric labs like 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.829
 you can see the temperature dropped to minus 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 five degrees celsius and heat pump 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.979
 began to show signs 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.960
 operation in defrost mode, and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 now clearly shows how ice is on 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.539
 tight heat exchanger in minutes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.189
 such speed does not guarantee full 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.289
 heat and maximum 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.749
 efficiency besides zubadan 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.340
 this is a smart heat pump defrost mode 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.130
 characterized by flexibility and ability 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.990
 self-learning thawing happens 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.939
 automatically and does not stop until those 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.340
 until the ice on the heat exchanger is 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.020
 melts completely heat pump zubadan 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.539
 defrosts twice as fast as 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.189
 conventional heat pumps name reliable and 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.119
 efficient and environmentally friendly 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.549

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.229
 zubadan heat pumps rate 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.270
 Benefits Latest Heating Systems 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.459
