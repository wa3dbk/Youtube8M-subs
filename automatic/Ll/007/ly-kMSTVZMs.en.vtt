SmartWatch to be released with a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.320 
SmartWatch to be released with a
sapphire<00:00:23.100> display<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.150> head<00:00:24.300> over

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
sapphire display if we just head over

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.759 
sapphire display if we just head over
here<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.869> actually<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.410> some

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
here we can actually see some

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
here we can actually see some
engineering<00:00:26.220> samples<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> different

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
engineering samples of all the different

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.089 
engineering samples of all the different
types<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> displays<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
types of displays that they use the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.339 
types of displays that they use the
reason<00:00:29.369> why<00:00:29.490> sapphire<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.390> crystal<00:00:30.900> display<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
reason why sapphire a crystal display is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
reason why sapphire a crystal display is
really<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> most<00:00:32.640> coveted

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
really is really one of the most coveted

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
really is really one of the most coveted
displays<00:00:33.540> before<00:00:34.140> smartwatches<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.800> because

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
displays before smartwatches it because

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
displays before smartwatches it because
you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.219> only<00:00:35.340> scratch<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.000> by<00:00:36.570> diamonds

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you can only scratch it by diamonds

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
you can only scratch it by diamonds
right<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> nice<00:00:38.670> leather<00:00:38.879> band

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
right so we have a nice leather band

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
right so we have a nice leather band
over<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
over here they can see that it is it is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
over here they can see that it is it is
fairly<00:00:41.489> thick<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.300> too<00:00:42.510> bad<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
fairly thick it's not too bad but if you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
fairly thick it's not too bad but if you
look<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.770> side<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
look at the back side this is where the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
look at the back side this is where the
connecting<00:00:45.780> sensor<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> where<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
connecting sensor is this is where the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
connecting sensor is this is where the
sensors<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.270> heart

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
sensors are that will take your heart

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
sensors are that will take your heart
rate<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.649> measure<00:00:49.920> your

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
rate and kind of like measure your

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
rate and kind of like measure your
general<00:00:50.610> health<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> look<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
general health let's take a look at the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.770 
general health let's take a look at the
watch<00:00:52.140> itself<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.660> we

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
watch itself it's back in there so if we

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
watch itself it's back in there so if we
remove<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> hair<00:00:56.039> let's<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
remove that hair let's see here so we

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
remove that hair let's see here so we
have<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.480> buttons<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.020> side<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.949> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
have two buttons on this side so this

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
have two buttons on this side so this
button<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.120> bring<00:01:03.690> us

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
button here will actually bring us

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
button here will actually bring us
through<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.580> features<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
through the different features of the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.460 
through the different features of the
phone<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
phone so this is actually all the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
phone so this is actually all the
different<00:01:07.770> watch<00:01:07.890> faces<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.520> could<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
different watch faces that we could have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.219 
different watch faces that we could have
all<00:01:09.320> right<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.920> press<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:12.140> let's<00:01:13.140> go

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
all right if we press down here let's go

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.580 
all right if we press down here let's go
back<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.310> there's<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:14.909> activity

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
back and if we go there's our activity

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.539 
back and if we go there's our activity
alright<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.189> activities

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
alright so we can see our activities

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.880 
alright so we can see our activities
today<00:01:18.170> right<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
today right and then we can see the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
today right and then we can see the
peaks<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> what's<00:01:21.119> cool<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
peaks on it and what's cool about this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
peaks on it and what's cool about this
is<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.439> trying<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.860> stimulate

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
is because it's trying to like stimulate

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
is because it's trying to like stimulate
our<00:01:23.580> our<00:01:24.150> health<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.560> too

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
our our health if we're I go for too

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
our our health if we're I go for too
long<00:01:25.920> it'll<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> gently<00:01:27.030> vibrate<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
long it'll kind of gently vibrate to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
long it'll kind of gently vibrate to
remind<00:01:28.110> us<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> hey<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.460> maybe

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
remind us that hey you know what maybe

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
remind us that hey you know what maybe
you<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.600> butt<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> bit

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you could get get off your butt a bit

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
you could get get off your butt a bit
move<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.220> head<00:01:32.340> over<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> takes

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
move so if we head over here it takes

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480 
move so if we head over here it takes
heart<00:01:33.299> rate<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.780> over<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.159> also<00:01:35.280> do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
heart rate right over you and we also do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
heart rate right over you and we also do
steps<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> stopwatch

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
steps and then here we have a stopwatch

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
steps and then here we have a stopwatch
so<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.729> hit<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> stopwatch<00:01:39.360> button<00:01:39.689> which

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so if we hit the stopwatch button which

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
so if we hit the stopwatch button which
is<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.170> button<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.070> stop<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
is the top button and we stop it
