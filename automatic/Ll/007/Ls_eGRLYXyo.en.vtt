alright our next step is going to be a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.260 
alright our next step is going to be a
tough<00:00:03.990> turn<00:00:04.259> basic<00:00:04.859> come<00:00:05.040> turn<00:00:05.279> or<00:00:05.759> what's

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
tough turn basic come turn or what's

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.990 
tough turn basic come turn or what's
called<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.690> sugar<00:00:06.990> Tong<00:00:07.610> so<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> step<00:00:08.940> is

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
called a sugar Tong so this step is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.509 
called a sugar Tong so this step is
similar<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.990> our<00:00:10.110> sugar<00:00:10.410> push<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
similar to our sugar push in that the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.570 
similar to our sugar push in that the
father<00:00:11.759> goes<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:12.330> pointing<00:00:13.070> back<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.370> point

the<00:00:31.529> fall<00:00:31.769> over<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> same<00:00:33.360> time

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the fall over it but at the same time

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
the fall over it but at the same time
we're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.170> bringing<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.559> arm<00:00:34.800> up

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we're going to be bringing that arm up

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.000 
we're going to be bringing that arm up
so<00:00:35.340> we're<00:00:35.460> staying<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> lock<00:00:37.010> lifting

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so we're staying in this lock lifting

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.869 
so we're staying in this lock lifting
the<00:00:38.280> arm<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.850> three<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.730> creates<00:00:41.730> what

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the arm for three and that creates what

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
the arm for three and that creates what
we<00:00:41.910> call<00:00:42.030> compression<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.070> found

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
we call compression which can be found

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
we call compression which can be found
right<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> top<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.379> release

right here at the top and then I release

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520 
right here at the top and then I release

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that to let her turn on cut for show

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.410

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.770 
doesn't come all the way around it's
just<00:02:19.459> about<00:02:19.790> somewhere<00:02:20.150> between<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.480> quarter

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
just about somewhere between a quarter

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.120 
just about somewhere between a quarter
and<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.989> half<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:24.880> five<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.360> six<00:02:27.319> good<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.950> couple

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and a half to five and six good a couple

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.559 
and a half to five and six good a couple
of<00:02:28.280> those<00:02:28.400> for<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.670> leaders<00:02:28.970> as<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.300> do<00:02:29.450> this

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
of those for the leaders as we do this

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.350 
of those for the leaders as we do this
will<00:02:29.750> also<00:02:29.930> absorb<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.800> follow<00:02:31.040> through<00:02:31.850> 3n

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
will also absorb it to follow through 3n

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.120 
will also absorb it to follow through 3n
we're<00:02:32.690> absorbing<00:02:33.080> through<00:02:33.500> using<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.890> body

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
we're absorbing through using the body

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.050 
we're absorbing through using the body
the<00:02:34.610> 3n<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.269> here<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.780> release<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.830> four<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.790> I'm

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
the 3n is here I release on four and I'm

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.729 
the 3n is here I release on four and I'm
not<00:02:38.209> trying<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> push<00:02:38.810> her<00:02:38.959> I'm<00:02:39.290> just<00:02:39.350> trying

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
not trying to push her I'm just trying

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.990 
not trying to push her I'm just trying
to<00:02:39.799> get<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.069> hand<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:40.430> over<00:02:40.610> her

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
to get that hand right over her

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.350 
to get that hand right over her
Harriette<00:02:41.769> five<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.130> six<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.090> comes

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
Harriette five and six and that comes

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.449 
Harriette five and six and that comes
down<00:02:44.480> slowly<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.769> think<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.280> as

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
down slowly so I think of this as

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.000 
down slowly so I think of this as
escalator<00:02:47.090> bottom<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:48.590> think<00:02:48.769> if<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:48.950> is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
escalator bottom and I think if this is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.250 
escalator bottom and I think if this is
spiral<00:02:49.580> staircase<00:02:50.090> down<00:02:50.360> you'll<00:02:50.989> see<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.200> on

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
spiral staircase down you'll see it on

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.470 
spiral staircase down you'll see it on
both<00:02:51.440> sides<00:02:53.110> location<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.290> escalator<00:02:55.220> up

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
both sides location have escalator up

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.810 
both sides location have escalator up
three<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.750> four<00:02:57.290> spiral<00:02:57.920> staircase<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.670> now

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
three and four spiral staircase you now

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.120 
three and four spiral staircase you now
have<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> sugar<00:03:02.390> top<00:03:02.690> or<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.079> basic<00:03:03.739> tuck<00:03:03.950> turn

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
have a sugar top or a basic tuck turn

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.940 
have a sugar top or a basic tuck turn
good<00:03:04.760> luck
