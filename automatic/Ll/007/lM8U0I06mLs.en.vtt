don't have a ton of really anything hey

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.930 
don't have a ton of really anything hey
there<00:05:10.810> it's<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.560> mess<00:05:11.830> they<00:05:12.010> have<00:05:12.220> some<00:05:12.490> talent

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
there it's a mess they have some talent

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.340 
there it's a mess they have some talent
but<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.270> mess<00:05:13.600> as<00:05:13.810> far<00:05:14.020> as<00:05:14.169> how<00:05:14.290> the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
but it's a mess as far as how the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.570 
but it's a mess as far as how the
minutes<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.830> points<00:05:15.190> are<00:05:15.280> going<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.460> be

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
minutes and points are going to be

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.430 
minutes and points are going to be
distributed<00:05:16.090> price<00:05:16.690> could<00:05:17.080> be<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.260> decent

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
distributed price could be a decent

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.230 
distributed price could be a decent
short-term<00:05:17.950> solution<00:05:18.400> while<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.580> wall<00:05:18.850> is<00:05:19.060> out
