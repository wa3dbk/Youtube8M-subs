00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.990
 I am like you I do not have much 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:09.099
 of time on the other hand I sÃ©g organized 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.119
 before you start your session 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.009
 weekly scrub 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.869
 so I advise you to do like 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.449
 me is to put first to rent 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.540
 heat you will see that will serve us 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.790
 just now but for now 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.870
 direction the bathroom to snap up 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.020
 under any circumstances 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.430
 the scrub has a double interest in 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.890
 eliminating the dead skin that 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.360
 tarnish the face on the one hand and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.300
 increasing product penetration 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.989
 moisturizers on the other hand a beauty gesture 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.329
 2 somehow 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 if your skin is sensitive or dry a 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.699
 weekly gentle scrub is enough 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.269
 but if it is thanks two sessions by 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.729
 week will be needed applied 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.219
 evenly the scrub product on 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.889
 your face your neck and your 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.739
 cleavage then worked on it 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:02.589
 scrupulously respecting his instructions 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 to increase its efficiency and especially 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.290
 to not brutalize your skin 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.500
 hold the skin of your face with 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 a hand posed by pulling slightly towards 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.010
 the top 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.990
 on the other side eliminate the scrub by 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.750
 gentle and circular movements on 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.020
 the entire face of the neck and the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 neckline 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.230
 finally reims and the remains of products to 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.720
 the clear water 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.790
 or even better by sprinkling your 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.690
 face with a water mist 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.300
 mineral now the water we have 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 bet on the fire too hot 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.050
 put on a turban to protect your 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 hair and if you wear lenses 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.280
 contact remove them for 5 drops 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.610
 essential oil 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 not one more in hot water I 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 well said hot not boiling 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.810
 as for the choice of oils, it is you who 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.280
 decide each one to his benefit and there 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.900
 necessarily have one that suits you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.909
 but beware the essential oils 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.090
 have a very powerful action 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.870
 so do not force nor the time nil dose 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.980
 bath remember 5 drops and five 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.090
 minutes for sensitive refrain 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.740
 lean over hot water 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.840
 as for an inhalation 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.360
 no but did not dive 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.060
 your face in the water alone effect of the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.000
 vapor the pores of the skin expands this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.440
 which increases the effectiveness of the mask or 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.830
 the moisturizer you are going 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 applied 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.599
 the masks sold in the trade are 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 very powerful and you have 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.530
 definitely already find the one that you 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.580
 however, I advise you to 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.370
 change regularly 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.599
 story to vary the benefits you 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.489
 would not like to eat always the same 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.280
 thing no and well your skin it's 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.290
 the same if you are more like 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.360
 homemade only ready-made dishes 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.840
 I propose to test these three 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.970
 mask and scrub recipes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.420
 be careful before using always 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.560
 a test on the inside of the forearm 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.530
 you can get the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.190
 ingredients at your herbalist or 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.359
 mix 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.190

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.590
 drops of essential oil that you 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.819
 choose according to your skin type is 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.530
 mix keeps very well at 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.790
 condition to place it in a bottle 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.790
 close for next use 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.260
 mix 2 tablespoons of clay 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.630
 with hot water until you get this 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.150
 consistency style let cool 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.010
 before adding a tablespoon of 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.709
 yogurt to make the texture more 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.360
 homogeneous finally pour a few drops 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.160
 of your favorite essential oil 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.330
 carefully avoid the eye area 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.190
 when you put down your mask 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.250
 a teaspoon of marigold petals 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.620
 fresh or dried in a mortar and batteries 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.690
 and delicately by adding a 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.120
 teaspoon of wheat germ oil 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.060
 then pour a teaspoon of 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.950
 honey yogurt and a teaspoon of 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.540

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.610
 mix and let rest a few 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.850
 minutes 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.280

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.889
 sos care for own is dehydrated 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.260
 apply a moisturizing serum before 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.229
 put the mask to increase its action 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.630
 and do not use water to remove the 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.630
 mask but a moisturizing tonic 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:29.929
 to eliminate cern bags under the eyes 

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:32.299
 or swollen eyelids making tea or 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:35.709
 an infusion the crushed mango juice 

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:38.179

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:40.669
 let cool in the fridge for 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:42.499

 tea it's just to show you but 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.919

 infusions are also 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.550
