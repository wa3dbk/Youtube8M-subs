they're impulse is to swing out so
you're<00:03:59.359> going<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.829> force<00:04:00.829> that<00:04:01.099> fold

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you're going to have to force that fold

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.229 
you're going to have to force that fold
until<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.819> becomes<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:03.130> regular<00:04:04.130> kind<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.819> full

for<00:04:40.600> hot<00:04:40.720> toys<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.110> make<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.800> could<00:04:42.250> argue

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
for hot toys to make you could argue

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.439 
for hot toys to make you could argue
that<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:42.729> should<00:04:42.760> be<00:04:43.000> focusing<00:04:43.389> their

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
that they should be focusing their

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.840 
that they should be focusing their
efforts<00:04:43.630> on<00:04:43.990> more<00:04:44.139> fam<00:04:44.410> demanded<00:04:44.830> figures<00:04:45.160> but

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
efforts on more fam demanded figures but

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.850 
efforts on more fam demanded figures but
I<00:04:46.150> think<00:04:46.810> it's<00:04:46.900> kind<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.139> cool<00:04:47.320> they<00:04:47.470> focus<00:04:47.800> on

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
I think it's kind of cool they focus on

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.439 
I think it's kind of cool they focus on
such<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.160> unique<00:04:48.520> moment<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:49.000> think<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.389> a

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
such a unique moment I think it's a

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.510 
such a unique moment I think it's a
great<00:04:49.660> service<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.199> Batman<00:04:50.620> fans<00:04:50.949> who

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
great service to Batman fans who

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.770 
great service to Batman fans who
probably<00:04:51.760> never<00:04:52.120> would<00:04:52.330> have<00:04:52.360> thought<00:04:52.449> that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
probably never would have thought that

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.510 
probably never would have thought that
they'd<00:04:52.870> ever<00:04:52.900> see<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.440> hot<00:04:53.710> toys<00:04:54.010> figure<00:04:54.400> of

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520
