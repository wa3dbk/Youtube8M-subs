bring them just to be a faster I got
lucky<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.820> found<00:00:43.879> a<00:00:44.090> scar<00:00:44.390> see<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:44.899> see<00:00:45.109> this

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
lucky and found a scar see you see this

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.600 
lucky and found a scar see you see this
run<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.800> that's<00:00:46.219> always<00:00:46.460> nice

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.479 

as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.450> see<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.989> run<00:00:55.440> around<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> same

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
as you can see I run around on the same

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
as you can see I run around on the same
barricades<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> avoid<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:58.170> zombies<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
barricades just to avoid the zombies and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
barricades just to avoid the zombies and
then<00:00:59.610> on<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.120> crates<00:01:00.630> is<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:01.770> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
then on these crates is where some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.090 
then on these crates is where some
weapons<00:01:02.340> spawn<00:01:02.700> so<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> always<00:01:03.450> check<00:01:03.780> those

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.410 

you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.940> kill<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you can take the time to kill all the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.930 
you can take the time to kill all the
zombies<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.650> prefer<00:01:11.190> just<00:01:11.369> sprinting

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
zombies but I prefer just sprinting

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.740 
zombies but I prefer just sprinting
around<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.790> zombies<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.210> unable<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
around and the zombies are unable to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.520 
around and the zombies are unable to
climb<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.619> top<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.840> blocks<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.410> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
climb up on top of these blocks so this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
climb up on top of these blocks so this
is<00:01:19.650> where<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> login<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> logout<00:01:20.840> when<00:01:21.840> I'm

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is where I login and logout when I'm

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.219 
is where I login and logout when I'm
serve<00:01:22.140> jumping<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.630> where<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.720> looking<00:01:24.930> at

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
serve jumping and where I'm looking at

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
serve jumping and where I'm looking at
is<00:01:25.440> where<00:01:25.649> weapons<00:01:25.830> spawn<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.360> there's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is where weapons spawn and then there's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
is where weapons spawn and then there's
three<00:01:27.990> times<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> back<00:01:28.649> that<00:01:28.710> I'll<00:01:29.009> look

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
three times in the back that I'll look

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.730 
three times in the back that I'll look
at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.700> two<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.330> far<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> then

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
at the two on the far right and then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
at the two on the far right and then
there's<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> far<00:01:32.820> left<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
there's one on the far left that I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
there's one on the far left that I
search<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.140> didn't<00:01:35.039> look<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.729> run

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
search I didn't look at them this run

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
search I didn't look at them this run
because<00:01:36.360> there's<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.840> more<00:01:37.050> zombies<00:01:37.649> there

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
because there's a lot more zombies there

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.190 
because there's a lot more zombies there
but<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.910> weapons<00:01:39.270> also<00:01:39.570> spawn<00:01:39.960> there

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
but some good weapons also spawn there

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800 
but some good weapons also spawn there
then<00:01:41.100> here's<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.550> view<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.880> mini-map<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
then here's the view of the mini-map of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.240 
then here's the view of the mini-map of
exactly<00:01:43.289> where<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.830> second

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
exactly where I'm at and then the second

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
exactly where I'm at and then the second
place<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.820> there's<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> hidden<00:01:51.750> 10<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.229> Pleasant

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
place is there's a hidden 10 in Pleasant

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.669 
place is there's a hidden 10 in Pleasant
Valley<00:01:53.000> where<00:01:54.000> they'll<00:01:54.539> responds<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.350> couple

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
Valley where they'll responds a couple

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.130 
Valley where they'll responds a couple
weapons<00:01:56.039> each<00:01:56.190> time<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.179> was<00:01:57.390> unlucky<00:01:57.929> on

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
weapons each time but I was unlucky on

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.690 
weapons each time but I was unlucky on
this<00:01:58.979> run<00:01:59.190> and<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.800> inside<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.369> around

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this run and it's just inside and around

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.960 
this run and it's just inside and around
the<00:02:03.030> time<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.450> where<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> item<00:02:04.080> spawn<00:02:07.970> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the time is where the item spawn and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.660 
the time is where the item spawn and
then<00:02:09.090> here's<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> mini-map<00:02:10.670> exactly

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
then here's on the mini-map exactly
