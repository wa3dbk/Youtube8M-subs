00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 shut up and save carola conrads has 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.010
 also done while washing and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.750
 Drying saves energy and thus 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.759
 money which is easier than you initially 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.650
 thought so she renounces 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.020
 For example, consistently on the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.199
 Pre-wash for quite some time I have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.150
 my habits changed a lot and 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.769
 addressing thereby also energy by me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 For example, not more than 90 degrees of laundry 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.510
 wash or 60 degrees laundry but 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.269
 mainly in 40 degree wash 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.550
 program or 30 degrees my laundry yet 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.809
 very clean and that is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 actually a great result and 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 after the end of the promised the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.840
 machine of course, immediately from the cook 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.059
 It was thanks to the latest technology and technology 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 modern detergent long obsolete 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 washing machines are the largest part 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 energy for heating the water 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.070
 used experts calculate in front of world 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 For example, his lingerie at 40 instead 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 At 60 degrees, the sport is about the same 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 half to electricity 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 I also have the washing machine earlier 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.520
 ever used with three distribute 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.590
 in there because I just needed a blouse 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.600
 I do not do that today today 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 totally the washing machine very good and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 then check that in a hand's breadth 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.850
 fits in between then it is great and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 The same applies to the dryer 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 because even when drying the laundry leaves 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 save a lot of energy without effort 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.189
 already the cleaning of the lint filter 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 shortens the drying time and how 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.340
 wash is also true when drying the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.080
 equipment not only for a few parts 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.990
 but always do it 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.810
 fully loaded and closet is dry than 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 program absolutely sufficient carola 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 Conrads is currently thinking about buying 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.939
 new equipment after drying and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 Washing machines have come in the years 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.119
 and offer the greatest savings potential 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.920
 modern energy-efficient devices 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 information can be found on carola conrads 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 Not only informed on the internet 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.560
 the energieagentur.nrw about it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.390
 you should pay attention 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.829
 Since the beginning of the year there is a new one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 Label for washing machines 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.049
 one distinguishes now when buying in the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.399
 Categorization between devices 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.100
 final double plus and triple plus 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.810
 We recommend the purchase of an apple plus 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.299
 device so that the highest 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.040
 Efficiency class but that's worth it 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.560
 the look exactly on the label because 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.430
 within a categorization there is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 still different 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.750
 Electricity consumption and the label gives you 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.630
 exact information about the power consumption 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.580
 per year the water consumption the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.800
 sling performance and the washing effect 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.930
 also when buying a new dryer 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 can carola conrads advise you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.410
 becomes clear the purchase price 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 alone does not say anything about it 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.730
 cheap is power consumption and the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.920
 incurred energy costs should be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730
 new purchase necessarily drawn into the calculus 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.710
 become 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.210
 at the energy efficient drying 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.190
 should you be in the device of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.570
 Energy efficiency class a purchase that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.459
 are usually dryer with 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.709
 heat pump which are one 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.720
 purchase more expensive about 400 euros 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.190
 but consume significantly less power 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.080
 and if that's on the whole 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.410
 life of about twelve years 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 extrapolated are the 1000 good 1000 euro 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.690
 they have less electricity costs there 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.489
 in the most environmentally friendly but it is after 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 as before the laundry in the fresh air 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.660
 to let dry it is a drying rack 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.489
 to have for little money and sun and 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.489
 Wind is always free
