00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
little bit buts the same thing pretty

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.250 
little bit buts the same thing pretty
much<00:05:41.700> won't<00:05:42.700> break<00:05:42.940> over<00:05:43.150> here<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:44.110> rear

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
much won't break over here the rear

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.170 
much won't break over here the rear
brake<00:05:44.470> over<00:05:44.740> here<00:05:44.950> hey<00:05:45.160> there<00:05:45.400> are<00:05:45.550> some<00:05:45.880> minor

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
brake over here hey there are some minor

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.610 
brake over here hey there are some minor
things<00:05:46.710> differences<00:05:47.710> between<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.760> two<00:05:48.910> quads

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
things differences between the two quads

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.600 
things differences between the two quads
for<00:05:50.620> one<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.710> thumb<00:05:53.920> throttle<00:05:54.220> is

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
for one the the thumb throttle is

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.820 
for one the the thumb throttle is
different<00:05:55.030> on<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.420> Suzuki<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:56.230> little<00:05:56.650> bit

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
different on the Suzuki a little bit

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.430 
different on the Suzuki a little bit
it's<00:05:57.010> actually<00:05:57.280> a<00:05:57.310> little<00:05:57.490> bit<00:05:57.690> thicker<00:05:58.690> over

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
it's actually a little bit thicker over

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.260 
it's actually a little bit thicker over
here<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:01.060> compared<00:06:01.660> to<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.870> Honda<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:04.150> can

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
here and compared to the Honda you can

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.510 
here and compared to the Honda you can
see<00:06:04.540> it's<00:06:05.140> it's<00:06:06.100> a<00:06:06.250> little<00:06:06.490> thinner<00:06:08.400> when<00:06:09.400> we

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
see it's it's a little thinner when we

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.360 
see it's it's a little thinner when we
first<00:06:09.730> got<00:06:09.850> these<00:06:10.060> quads<00:06:10.390> I<00:06:10.870> actually<00:06:11.370> hated

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
first got these quads I actually hated

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.050 
first got these quads I actually hated
the<00:06:12.669> Honda's<00:06:13.860> throttle<00:06:14.860> because<00:06:15.040> when<00:06:15.970> you

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
the Honda's throttle because when you

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.510 
the Honda's throttle because when you
get<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.330> stock<00:06:16.600> there<00:06:17.230> are<00:06:17.410> turndown<00:06:17.980> actually

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
get it stock there are turndown actually

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.370 
get it stock there are turndown actually
even<00:06:18.880> more<00:06:19.090> so<00:06:19.480> then<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.960> throttles<00:06:20.290> like

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
even more so then the throttles like

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.650 
even more so then the throttles like
down<00:06:20.560> here<00:06:21.010> and<00:06:21.160> it's<00:06:22.060> really<00:06:22.300> uncomfortable

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
down here and it's really uncomfortable

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.180 
down here and it's really uncomfortable
so<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.169> have<00:06:23.320> to<00:06:23.440> if<00:06:23.770> you're<00:06:23.890> going<00:06:23.979> to<00:06:24.070> get

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
so you have to if you're going to get

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.300 
so you have to if you're going to get
this<00:06:24.310> quad<00:06:24.550> move<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.180> throttle<00:06:25.360> up<00:06:25.660> and<00:06:26.310> make

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
this quad move the throttle up and make

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.340 
this quad move the throttle up and make
you<00:06:27.430> so<00:06:27.610> it's<00:06:27.760> comfortable<00:06:28.180> for<00:06:28.450> wherever<00:06:29.050> you

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
you so it's comfortable for wherever you

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.490 
you so it's comfortable for wherever you
want<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.740> also<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:31.240> there's<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.960> difference<00:06:32.320> in

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
want it also the there's a difference in

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.050 
want it also the there's a difference in
the<00:06:32.950> kill<00:06:33.280> switch<00:06:33.550> on<00:06:35.490> if<00:06:36.490> you<00:06:36.580> can<00:06:36.700> see<00:06:36.880> that

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
the kill switch on if you can see that

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.510 
the kill switch on if you can see that
but<00:06:37.360> on<00:06:37.540> the<00:06:38.020> Suzuki<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.770> kill<00:06:39.100> switch<00:06:39.370> is

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
but on the Suzuki the kill switch is

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280 
but on the Suzuki the kill switch is
right<00:06:39.550> here<00:06:40.000> turn<00:06:40.630> it<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:40.960> left

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
right here turn it to the left

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.020 
right here turn it to the left
it<00:06:41.560> kills<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:41.890> engine<00:06:42.340> turn<00:06:42.700> to<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:42.910> right

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
it kills the engine turn to the right

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.020 
it kills the engine turn to the right
you<00:06:43.270> can<00:06:43.300> start<00:06:43.660> it<00:06:43.750> up<00:06:43.870> on<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:45.310> Honda<00:06:47.820> you<00:06:48.820> can

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
you can start it up on the Honda you can

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.400 
you can start it up on the Honda you can
hit<00:06:49.479> it<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:51.040> right<00:06:51.479> or<00:06:52.479> to<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.840> left<00:06:52.900> and

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
hit it to the right or to the left and

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.670 
hit it to the right or to the left and
needs<00:06:54.100> to<00:06:54.220> be<00:06:54.400> in<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:54.760> middle<00:06:55.090> to<00:06:55.750> start<00:06:56.530> the

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
needs to be in the middle to start the

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.060 
needs to be in the middle to start the
quad<00:06:56.890> another<00:06:57.400> thing<00:06:57.729> is<00:06:58.060> that<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:59.070> shifter

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
quad another thing is that the shifter

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.790 
quad another thing is that the shifter
on<00:07:00.100> the<00:07:00.250> Suzuki<00:07:00.840> is<00:07:01.840> a<00:07:02.229> little<00:07:02.560> bit<00:07:02.650> more

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
on the Suzuki is a little bit more

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.430 
on the Suzuki is a little bit more
complicated<00:07:03.520> you<00:07:04.300> can<00:07:04.450> see<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:05.020> it<00:07:05.110> attaches

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
complicated you can see that it attaches

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.670 
complicated you can see that it attaches
here<00:07:06.600> there's<00:07:07.600> a<00:07:07.690> bunch<00:07:07.870> of<00:07:07.900> different<00:07:07.990> points

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.470 

that<00:07:11.070> makes<00:07:11.250> it<00:07:11.370> a<00:07:11.430> little<00:07:11.850> complicated<00:07:12.270> but

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
that makes it a little complicated but

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.840 
that makes it a little complicated but
also<00:07:12.810> makes<00:07:13.050> it<00:07:13.140> stronger<00:07:13.590> so<00:07:14.280> if<00:07:14.430> you<00:07:14.550> are

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
also makes it stronger so if you are

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.200 
also makes it stronger so if you are
really<00:07:15.270> hitting<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.260> shifter<00:07:16.590> really<00:07:16.800> hard

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
really hitting the shifter really hard

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.890 
really hitting the shifter really hard
you<00:07:18.210> don't<00:07:18.330> really<00:07:18.420> have<00:07:18.540> to<00:07:18.630> worry<00:07:18.810> about

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
you don't really have to worry about

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.310 
you don't really have to worry about
this<00:07:19.080> thing<00:07:19.140> bending<00:07:19.880> on<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:21.030> Honda<00:07:21.480> I<00:07:21.780> have

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
this thing bending on the Honda I have

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.240 
this thing bending on the Honda I have
seen<00:07:22.770> the<00:07:23.490> shifters<00:07:24.000> Bend<00:07:24.330> a<00:07:24.450> lot<00:07:24.950> if<00:07:25.950> you<00:07:26.070> hit

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
seen the shifters Bend a lot if you hit

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.040 
seen the shifters Bend a lot if you hit
it<00:07:26.340> really<00:07:26.520> hard

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
it really hard

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.270 
it really hard
because<00:07:28.050> you<00:07:28.140> can<00:07:28.260> see<00:07:28.440> that<00:07:28.710> just<00:07:29.010> it

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
because you can see that just it

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.020 
because you can see that just it
directly<00:07:29.670> mounts<00:07:30.090> right<00:07:30.270> here<00:07:31.610> so<00:07:32.610> it's<00:07:32.790> real

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
directly mounts right here so it's real

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:44.519 
directly mounts right here so it's real
simple<00:07:33.330> but<00:07:34.850> it's<00:07:35.850> not<00:07:36.000> as<00:07:36.210> strong

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:44.529 

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.589 

you
