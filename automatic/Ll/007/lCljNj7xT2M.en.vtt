00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.400
 Oh Louis remember that a gay fight family that sailed to the sea literally to 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.170
 Escape 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.090
 What Homosexuality Seizes Society 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.840
 Then they ended up like good and I do not know but they were in supplies 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.429
 They were caught in a storm 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 Some Venezuelan crude was like a cargo ship to help them 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550
 It was a complete disaster they were planning to leave 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.740
 Again there was talk about using Tron with ALLS required 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 Andrich interviewed Shawn Gastonia who is believed to be my father and he said it was 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.260
 His wife and children have left again 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.320
 And they might do it on a boat again listening to this and this time the problem 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.770
 he is 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.670
 % Ah is the kind of Christian Christian persecution I think being 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.610
 Now persecution in this country 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.809
 Listening to this from the radio does not get the impression 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.640
 It has shown that persecution against Christians is some term 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.329
 You'll be right here right here in your area 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.660
 In art states I already have jobs but 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.590
 Through all the hoops you have to jump through the dispersed food banks researcher 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 You are so far me haaa 38 do to help your neighbor 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.720
 Listen To Stop There are hoops you have to jump through in order to start the food 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 Bank 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280
 Indicating bias against Christians is fine to have it well interesting pay 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 Above pointing to prejudice against Christians let us listen to a little more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.080
 You know it's it's already happened 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.619
 You are making plans 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.470
 To become another attempt to leave the country 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.500
 Oh yeah I'm getting a business statement 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.869
 Which is currently offered yes so you plan on sailing again 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.610
 You may so we are going to play this thing there are no Asians who is 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.140
 Now Peter Parker said the story has seen work 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.180
 Their nominal years share with food so it does not matter what 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.079
 What happens was a good bonded you know what Louis 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.850
 Maybe it's smarter to avoid a boat this time so it does not end up being stranded 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.759
 Somewhere in the get picked by the Venezuelans or something like that there 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.649
 Anti-gay 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.040
 On racism and xenophobia and that they believe there is anti-Christianism 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.880
 Methodological error - bias - bias 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.390
 I would recommend maybe just take a plane somewhere where the problem of course is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.069
 Maybe you'll end up somewhere 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.890
 Where you do not like people because you fight gay and xenophobia 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
 It's a worrying situation not what they see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.540
 I am a Christian persecution may just be 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.989
 Someone idiot yet but I and you know what killed their children 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.379
 Contract 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 Now, now they're going to try to kill their children again someone please 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.500
 Take the children away 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.800
 Burmese more Louis they get a bigger boat this time 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.410
 Also what I did not like I have a giant 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.069
 No I do not I do not think they are going to do too hot on 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.030
 Its just amazing to II I do not even know what to say anyway 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.910
 Then the gay fight lost in the sea family is now 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.629
 To sail away again we will continue to track progress and 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.280
 Where they end up
