00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 Hello everyone, Artem, and today I 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 present you my mods build 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 patch 0 8 6 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 let's go so the first thing that throws in 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 eyes this is xvm xvm which previously did not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.660
 It was now in my assembly I 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 I think you will find it very useful because 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470
 me actually in a fight he is very 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.269
 helps 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 the mod goes further away darkness 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.269
 sniper mode 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.519
 very nice thing that clean here 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.720
 this dark veil in sniper mode 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.720
 which increases the review 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.010
 our minimap has changed a bit and 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.170
 click caps lock and our me card is already 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 no less card it turns out full 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 the screen here we see that the icons of the tanks 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.350
 zoomed also they have a signature with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 names of tanks 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.019
 and there is a radius of view on the map also 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.550
 tags remain where was the last time 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.550
 illuminated enemy tank 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.180
 can not do without such a fashion as 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.430
 commander's camera commander's camera 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 allows you to move the camera away from the tank on 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.970
 maximum distance 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.399
 what allows you to look behind the corners 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.860
 see where the enemy's direction is directed 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.549
 and whether to go on it or better 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.549
 stand a little 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 my favorite damage panel shows 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.149
 damage that was dealt to you by the center 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.189
 the screen it is shown in red numbers below 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.740
 duplicated near the damage panel 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.110
 the tank is a little higher is warm 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.659
 this panel show the damage which but 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.659
 if you are part of her rick 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 capture band they are shown how many tank 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.119
 is in a circle and what is the time 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.599
 It will still continue to grip it too 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.709
 Included in the xvm scope has not undergone 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.680
 no changes 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.319
 deal all as well timer recharge right 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.010
 percentage of strength on art-sau all 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 is logical 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.900
 the only thing in the art mode on the right 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.209
 shows the time of the flight of the projectile separately 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.209
 for succulent faded again and armor piercing 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.260
 there is also a bell in the assembly 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260
 crit 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:46.569
 and now let's consider the installation 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.799
 mods and what awaits us later in the hangar 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.049
 everything up to a single file 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.829
 You can download this file by the link. 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.319
 which is in the description of this video 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.150
 here is the file you download 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:06.040
 lower it and the installation begins 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.269
 here we click further agree 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 here is a description of the mods that 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.419
 there are assemblies here click further 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.930
 here we point the way the way to our 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.719
 the game 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.849
 where is root of tanks specified 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.209
 our game folder 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.049
 just click next to create a shortcut to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.769
 desktop 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.739
 further and install the installation will not take 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.530
 a lot of time literally a minute even 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.139
 maybe less 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.699
 unpacking is very fast 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.299
 When the installation is complete, a window will appear. 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.220
 which just restart the computer 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.780
 click done and restart 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.359
 computer on your desktop you 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.049
 another file will appear such as xvm 0 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.340
 8 6 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.129
 it is we who launch it 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.299
 window where it says that the process starts 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.979
 world of tanks. 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.979
 and where actually all 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 without even going into the hangar, we have apparently this 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.070
 mod on pink 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.170
 all seven are written in the upper left 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.690
 Vostrov hand and drink on these servers 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.250
 you can immediately choose the most suitable 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.090
 for a comfortable game server and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.820

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.480
 people 5 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.440
 so we fall into the hangar the first thing we 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.450
 see it 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.260
 call tank icons are located in two 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.480
 Row very convenient if you very very 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.080
 many tanks I have, in principle, they are not so 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.310
 too much 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.560
 they are almost all here on the screen further mod 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.130
 on the crew as we know you can immediately 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.020
 disembarking the whole crew before and here to plant 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.070
 reverse type we have one 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.100
 man and it is very uncomfortable therefore 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.850
 now we drop the whole crew and click 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.650
 right button 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.910

 latest native crew with one touch 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.680

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.750

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.840
 xvm shows total extended 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.150
 statistics also have sorting there 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.790
 filter example you have a lot of tanks 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.270
 it is necessary to find statistics about some 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.920
 a specific tank for example batt 25t 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.290
 c-dial type the first three letters and 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 please give us two results 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.630
 This is the percentage of batchat and batchat and flock so 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.640
 does each tank have a total 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.670
 statistics 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.400
 full extended all you need very much 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.950
 nice mod and if you want there 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.570
 to watch someoneâ€™s tanks or 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.130
 hangar 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.080

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.400
