knife<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.990> SE<00:00:31.320> four<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.310> you<00:00:32.460> might

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
knife the SE four for as you might

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
knife the SE four for as you might
imagine<00:00:32.790> stands<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.540> four<00:00:33.720> inches<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
imagine stands for four inches on the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.490 
imagine stands for four inches on the
blade<00:00:34.560> length<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.580> a<00:00:35.610> 1095<00:00:36.480> carbon<00:00:36.510> steel

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
blade length it is a 1095 carbon steel

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.430 
blade length it is a 1095 carbon steel
now<00:00:38.130> when<00:00:38.310> I<00:00:38.340> first<00:00:38.700> got<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.180> blade<00:00:39.480> that's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
now when I first got this blade that's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
now when I first got this blade that's
all<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.860> offered<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.850> carbon<00:00:42.390> steel

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
all they offered it in was carbon steel

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.680 
all they offered it in was carbon steel
now<00:00:43.050> they're<00:00:43.320> available<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.950> stainless<00:00:44.370> steel

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
now they're available in stainless steel

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
now they're available in stainless steel
so<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:45.989> something<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.470> want<00:00:46.500> that's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so if that's something you want that's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
so if that's something you want that's
something<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> think<00:00:48.629> part<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
something you can get I think part of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
something you can get I think part of
that<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:50.120> they<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.629> bit

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that reason is they are a little bit

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
that reason is they are a little bit
easier<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> take<00:00:52.350> care<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.220> carbon

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
easier to take care of as the carbon

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.170 
easier to take care of as the carbon
steel<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.090> rust<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.720> you<00:00:55.290> can<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.589> a<00:00:55.620> nice

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
steel will rust and you can get a nice

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
steel will rust and you can get a nice
throne<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.420> sparks<00:00:57.930> coming<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.949> fella

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
throne of sparks coming off your fella

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.640 
throne of sparks coming off your fella
rod<00:00:59.550> from<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> spine<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.690> blade<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
rod from the spine of the blade with a

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.950 
rod from the spine of the blade with a
carbon<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.239> carbon<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:03.809> it's

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
carbon because it's carbon and it's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160 
carbon because it's carbon and it's
prone<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> rust<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.339> coat<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.060> blade<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
prone to rust they do coat the blade so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
prone to rust they do coat the blade so
it<00:01:07.290> helps<00:01:07.560> protect<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.460> result<00:01:09.000> you're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it helps protect it as a result you're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
it helps protect it as a result you're
not<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.659> able<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
not going to be able to use the back of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.040 
not going to be able to use the back of
the<00:01:10.979> blade<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> spine<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> blade<00:01:12.120> to

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
the blade or the spine of the blade to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.960 
the blade or the spine of the blade to
throw<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.620> sparks<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.640> Ferro<00:01:14.880> rod

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
throw your sparks from your Ferro rod

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.390 
throw your sparks from your Ferro rod
now<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.140> does<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> sharpen

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
now this one does have the sharpen

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
now this one does have the sharpen
swedge<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.720> spine<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> blade<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
swedge on the spine of the blade I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
swedge on the spine of the blade I
believe<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> black<00:01:21.600> versions<00:01:22.290> only<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
believe the black versions only the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
believe the black versions only the
black<00:01:22.950> coated<00:01:23.400> blades<00:01:23.870> only<00:01:24.870> will<00:01:25.409> come<00:01:25.590> with

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
black coated blades only will come with

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.850 
black coated blades only will come with
that<00:01:25.979> feature<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.440> fighting

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that feature now for me and a fighting

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
that feature now for me and a fighting
knife<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.370> really<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.570> feature<00:01:30.840> because

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
knife I really like that feature because

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
knife I really like that feature because
it<00:01:31.500> offers<00:01:31.830> some<00:01:32.130> versatility<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.420> using<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it offers some versatility with using it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.370 
it offers some versatility with using it
on<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> back<00:01:34.230> cut<00:01:34.550> with<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.580> woods<00:01:36.090> blade<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.780> hate

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
on a back cut with a woods blade I hate

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.150 
on a back cut with a woods blade I hate
it<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:38.730> I<00:01:38.940> actually<00:01:39.450> filed<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.440> so

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
it so this one I actually filed down so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.770 
it so this one I actually filed down so
it<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.580> more<00:01:41.880> blunt<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.480> I<00:01:42.540> could

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it was a little more blunt so I could

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.750 
it was a little more blunt so I could
use<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.050> more<00:01:43.080> effectively<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
use it more effectively out here you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.210 
use it more effectively out here you
know<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.330> reason<00:01:45.570> why<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.740> don't<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
know this is one reason why I don't like

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
know this is one reason why I don't like
the<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:48.080> portion<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.320> sweat<00:01:49.680> sharpened

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the back portion of the sweat sharpened

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
the back portion of the sweat sharpened
on<00:01:50.910> outdoors<00:01:51.360> knives<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> times<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.800> want

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on outdoors knives a lot of times I want

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.650 
on outdoors knives a lot of times I want
to<00:01:53.010> process<00:01:53.280> wood<00:01:54.140> down<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.620> finer

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
to process wood down a little bit finer

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.090 
to process wood down a little bit finer
and<00:01:58.340> these<00:01:59.340> smaller<00:02:00.090> pieces<00:02:00.620> much<00:02:01.620> easier<00:02:01.980> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and these smaller pieces much easier to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.980

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
blade you do have some jimping right

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.360 
blade you do have some jimping right
here<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:39.480> not<00:03:39.900> aggressive<00:03:40.320> jumping<00:03:41.040> but

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
here and it's not aggressive jumping but

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.430 
here and it's not aggressive jumping but
it's<00:03:41.520> also<00:03:41.730> not<00:03:42.090> jumping<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.840> for<00:03:43.020> looks

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it's also not jumping just for looks

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.410 
it's also not jumping just for looks
it<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:43.920> very<00:03:44.070> functional<00:03:44.700> jimping<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.390> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it is very functional jimping that I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.900 
it is very functional jimping that I
think<00:03:45.690> most<00:03:46.080> people<00:03:46.590> are<00:03:46.830> going<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.670> like

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
think most people are going to like

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.300 
think most people are going to like
because<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.630> its<00:03:48.870> its<00:03:49.260> balance<00:03:49.770> between<00:03:49.950> being

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
because of its its balance between being

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.130 
because of its its balance between being
effective<00:03:50.880> but<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.270> being<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.750> much<00:03:51.930> that

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
effective but not being so much that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.750

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
notice just by looking at this blade is

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.950 
notice just by looking at this blade is
it's<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.770> very<00:04:26.040> simple<00:04:26.520> design<00:04:27.180> there's<00:04:27.690> not<00:04:27.930> a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
it's a very simple design there's not a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's a very simple design there's not a
lot<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:29.000> extra<00:04:30.000> things<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.110> blade<00:04:31.380> that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
lot of extra things on this blade that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.810 
lot of extra things on this blade that
we<00:04:31.680> don't<00:04:31.980> need<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.940> simple<00:04:33.480> but<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:34.020> very

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
we don't need it's simple but it's very

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.090 
we don't need it's simple but it's very
very<00:04:35.820> effective<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.320> think<00:04:37.350> that's<00:04:37.740> one

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
very effective and I think that's one

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.970 
very effective and I think that's one
reason<00:04:38.370> why<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.730> thing<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:39.800> popular<00:04:40.800> and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
reason why this thing is so popular and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.550 
reason why this thing is so popular and
so<00:04:41.070> well<00:04:41.760> liked<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.450> knife<00:04:42.600> community<00:04:43.110> one

so well liked in the knife community one
of<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.710> aspects<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.340> makes<00:04:44.550> makes<00:04:44.970> this

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
of the aspects that makes makes this

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.180 
of the aspects that makes makes this
such<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.510> high<00:04:45.750> value<00:04:45.960> knife<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.890> sheath

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
such a high value knife is the sheath

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.790 
such a high value knife is the sheath
that<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.580> comes<00:04:47.880> with<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.870> doesn't<00:04:49.229> require<00:04:49.470> in

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
that it comes with it doesn't require in

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.559 
that it comes with it doesn't require in
my<00:04:49.979> opinion

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
my opinion

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.540 
my opinion
and<00:04:50.659> aftermarket<00:04:51.169> sheathe<00:04:51.619> now<00:04:52.249> you<00:04:52.309> can

and aftermarket sheathe now you can

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.859 
and aftermarket sheathe now you can
certainly<00:04:52.699> do<00:04:53.029> that<00:04:53.089> so<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.449> can<00:04:53.569> add<00:04:53.659> some

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:53.869 
certainly do that so you can add some

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:55.600 
certainly do that so you can add some
personalization<00:04:54.439> but<00:04:54.889> for<00:04:55.069> me<00:04:55.189> the<00:04:55.369> sheet

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
personalization but for me the sheet

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.429 
personalization but for me the sheet
that<00:04:55.759> it<00:04:55.849> comes<00:04:56.119> with<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.689> perfectly<00:04:57.379> fine<00:04:59.439> you
