and<00:00:48.650> going<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:50.710> this

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.620 

after<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.719> cut<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.289> can<00:01:23.320> either<00:01:24.630> choose

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
after you cut it you can either choose

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.219 
after you cut it you can either choose
to<00:01:26.399> sew<00:01:27.399> these<00:01:27.729> sites<00:01:28.180> together<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.170> you

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
to sew these sites together so you

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.620 
to sew these sites together so you
doesn't<00:01:29.860> get<00:01:29.979> inside<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.700> or<00:01:30.969> you<00:01:31.479> just

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
doesn't get inside of it or you just

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.539 
doesn't get inside of it or you just
leave<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.929> hanging<00:01:32.140> like<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.619> my<00:01:33.219> ferrets

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
leave it hanging like that my ferrets

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
leave it hanging like that my ferrets
kind<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.270> going<00:01:34.450> there<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:34.750> not<00:01:34.899> really

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
kind of going there but not really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.260 
kind of going there but not really
because<00:01:36.130> they're<00:01:36.340> not<00:01:36.429> smart<00:01:36.640> enough<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:37.149> go

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
because they're not smart enough to go

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.580 
because they're not smart enough to go
in<00:01:37.390> there<00:01:37.539> and<00:01:37.720> they<00:01:37.840> haven't<00:01:38.079> figured<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.470> out

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
in there and they haven't figured it out

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.690 
in there and they haven't figured it out
and<00:01:39.630> after<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.840> cut<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.350> I'm<00:01:42.009> hoping<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.520> want

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
and after you cut it I'm hoping you want

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.109 
and after you cut it I'm hoping you want
it<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.090> fold<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.780> everything<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:45.119> bend

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
it and fold it and everything you bend

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.880 
it and fold it and everything you bend
the<00:01:46.329> corners<00:01:46.780> like<00:01:47.140> this<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:48.159> then<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:49.560> cut<00:01:50.560> a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the corners like this and then you cut a

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.149 
the corners like this and then you cut a
slit<00:01:51.819> in<00:01:53.189> there

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
slit in there

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.109 
slit in there
and<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.939> big<00:01:57.329> enough<00:01:57.509> -<00:01:57.750> Spig<00:01:58.259> bam<00:01:58.820> hook<00:01:59.820> feel

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and then big enough - Spig bam hook feel

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.219 
and then big enough - Spig bam hook feel
and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.289> do<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.829> all<00:02:02.009> four<00:02:02.039> corners

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
and then you do that to all four corners

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.529 
and then you do that to all four corners
and<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.700> you've<00:02:05.820> used<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> put<00:02:06.420> in

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
and then what you've used to put in

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.930 
and then what you've used to put in
there<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> clip<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.890> could<00:02:08.099> use<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
there as a clip you could use one of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.770 
there as a clip you could use one of
these<00:02:09.149> things<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.550> they<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.760> open<00:02:12.630> like

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
these things and they just open like

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.040 
these things and they just open like
this<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.720> clip<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
this and then you can clip it to the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.030 
this and then you can clip it to the
cage<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:18.769> yeah<00:02:19.769> that's<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
