barefoot technology it allows your feet

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
barefoot technology it allows your feet
to<00:00:32.279> spread<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.239> move<00:00:33.870> naturally<00:00:34.530> like

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to spread out and move naturally like

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.410 
to spread out and move naturally like
they're<00:00:34.890> inherently<00:00:35.190> meant<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> this

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
they're inherently meant to and this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.810 
they're inherently meant to and this
only<00:00:36.750> results<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.469> better<00:00:37.530> stability<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
only results in better stability and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
only results in better stability and
more<00:00:39.059> natural<00:00:39.239> motion<00:00:39.750> which<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
more natural motion which you need to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
more natural motion which you need to
your<00:00:40.680> golf<00:00:40.890> swing<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.520> golf<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> an<00:00:42.090> active

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
your golf swing the golf is an active

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
your golf swing the golf is an active
game<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.800> Footwear<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
game and you need to have Footwear that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
game and you need to have Footwear that
really<00:00:44.610> allows<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.239> swing<00:00:45.629> there's<00:00:46.260> most

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
really allows you to swing there's most

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.270 
really allows you to swing there's most
so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.820> also<00:00:48.120> notice<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> outsole<00:00:49.289> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so you also notice on the outsole you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
so you also notice on the outsole you
got<00:00:50.430> spike<00:00:50.870> extraction<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.140> allows<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
got spike extraction and this allows you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.340 
got spike extraction and this allows you
to<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:53.000> increased<00:00:54.000> ground<00:00:54.449> contact<00:00:54.780> for

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to have increased ground contact for

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
to have increased ground contact for
better<00:00:55.530> traction<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> stability<00:00:56.309> throughout

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
better traction and stability throughout

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.380 
better traction and stability throughout
your<00:00:57.090> swing<00:00:57.440> also<00:00:58.460> what<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.730> here<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
reduced heel lift for better posture and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
reduced heel lift for better posture and
