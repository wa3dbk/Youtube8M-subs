 it's called burn-in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.359
 what does it mean to threat 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.250

 determine a flaw already having under the

 warrington points 105 years while kevlar 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.560
 and terrestrial deflections of 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.440
 Phenomenal suspensions account years of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.119
 two tanks 450 liters this year 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.950
 again it's the car to beat because 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.410
 that wherever she goes she potted 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.550
 then there is only one solution left 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.220
 back to his opponents 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.330
 wait a few more months 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.800
 since the end of the year is 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.200
 extraordinary technology monster 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.090
 are going to be sentenced to a pension 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 forced since a foolish settlement and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.130
 demagogic the ban in 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 competitions 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.259
 we do harry determine you have 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.250
 found the global definition and green is 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.630
 so once she's gone between 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.350
 the hands of ari vatanen do not the greens 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.810
 have started lessons from the father when he 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.630
 is imperative this is of course of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.399
 put enough 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.810
 pressure I will say when I say 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.180
 pressure these pressures of cins against 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.180
 quotes on the piloting so as to 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.030
 see anyway an essay that is year 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.860
 its workforce but of course it is 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 forbidden to get off the road breaks a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 car has already happened to us but we 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.860
 prefer to avoid so you forbid them 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.630
 all excess quite otherwise it's a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.190
 winding braces otherwise it's the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 sanction 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.890
 what is the penalty it is between 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.660
 we who would make that grain watch 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.670
 first debugging session on 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.440
 bitumen at montlhéry followed here by test in 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.000
 any terrain in which the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.709
 teammates of Pierre Lartigue and Ari 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 vatanen to know michel perrin and 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.220
 the Irish brothers gallagher all one 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 important apparatus which is very 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.280
 developed and this is the last time 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.799
 we will see if this apparatus 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 operate on the night not 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.010
 this is the most appropriate place for 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.780
 detect possible faults or 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.890
 small malfunctions compared to 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 what we are used to having or even 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.560
 proof of comfort of their car 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.200
 was perfect did not do as good 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 nothing really to do not just to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.040
 watch harry lead 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.250
 with its four world titles 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.720
 Rally any pocket because land 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.880
 the article will rush him on this 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 2000 with the firm intention of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.530
 bring back to Tunisia an eighth victory 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.470
 he will also start with a pinch at 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.930
 heart of the citroen soon she will go in 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.970
 museums but I often go to 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.050
 regret because for me it's the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.760
 rolls of 4 4 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.170
 and then I did so many races 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.610
 had so many kilometers and then I 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.770
 brought back so much of victory to citroën 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.050
 for me it will be a period of my life 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.910
 that I will always remember it not 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.780
 do not underestimate the small state and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.320
 maybe there is something that the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.370
 mechanisms have not seen it and then he 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.040
 must be done 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.320
 but in any case it allows me to climb 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.180
 in Paris 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.560
 dinner viana lunch well once because 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.690
 that it does not speak very often 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.800
 ah to be suspicious if that day 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.670
 arrive offers you a little tour in 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.670
 car after lunch
