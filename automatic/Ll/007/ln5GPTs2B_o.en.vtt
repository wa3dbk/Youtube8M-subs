00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the whole periodic table in one drop 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.700
 Ekaterinburg News Continues 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 special project the whole truth about water 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.290
 every week we tell you about 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.090
 what is actually contained in the fluid 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.460
 which we drink clean she seems 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.139
 only at first glance 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 today, experts have studied whether 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 purify industrial tap water 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800
 elite filters and device not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.430
 the usual type of verdict of experts in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.430
 special report 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.630
 nitrites chloroform iron and manganese 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.940
 exceeding these indicators even 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.040
 small can significantly affect 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.960
 human health a whole bunch of harmful 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 substances experts kim laboratories 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 found in the Ural water 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.020
 clean it up and bring it to state 5 you 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.000
 can not even filter the last series we 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.510
 checked the most popular low-cost 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.060
 models 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.770
 experts came to the conclusion that the filter 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060
 and tap water people just 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.830
 cheating themselves 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.920
 There is such a concept in medicine as 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.840
 placebo is when a patient is given a pacifier 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.470
 there is no medicinal treatment 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.060
 substances 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.450
 it becomes easier it is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.310
 self-hypnosis here is also significant 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.010
 measure the effect of such self-suggestion 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.680
 set the filter to thaw yes better yes 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.660
 no better look here on the eve of the analysis 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 past results have shown that when 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.440
 frequent use of such water to me 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.990
 people can develop the most dangerous 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.540
 disease from osteoporosis and problems with 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.690
 liver before the formation of malignant 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 tumors 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.040
 Meanwhile, experts note in the oil in 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.930
 fire can add and pollute 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.030
 replaceable cartridges besides many 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.929
 residents may not know when it is better 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.759
 change the cassette if the filter and long 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.570
 choose cartridges but they can there 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.210
 bloom 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.220
 here can get some here 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 whale bacteria get there too then 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.630
 watch the madonna filter itself came to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.770
 to us from Europe where according to experts 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.110
 the water is much cleaner 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 Well, our fluids can not say this 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.069
 for the Ural water is of great importance 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 has seasonality at different times and years 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.179
 different liquid flows for example during 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.160
 spring flood is great degree 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.810
 get hepatitis a in summer 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 the bacteria content of the group increases 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 E. coli which can lead to 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.700
 Din Teren but especially high risk 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.700
 early fall 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.900
 in this series we decided to check the most 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 unusual expensive filters for the first 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.870
 Samples are sent to the new building in 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.420
 lately in Ekaterinburg 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.220
 there was a fashion for collective filters 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 This devices in 2 meters high 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 which are usually installed in basements 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.880
 houses one of these we found in only 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.280
 that high-rises are built on its tenants 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.140
 not having time to settle use water 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.180
 straight from the tap in the hope that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.720
 huge machine clean it from harmful 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.790
 impurities 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.790
 in our house I know that we are like us 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.530
 somewhat related to the design of this 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.770
 at home I knew there were some filters 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.250
 Well, they said that in principle they are water 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.570
 cleaned of mechanical impurities 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.460
 bottle of water we send 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.200
 laboratory test results are not 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.180
 pleases this liquid not even 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.160
 meets the requirements of plumbing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.710
 water exceeded the amount of organic 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.060
 carbon on the other indicators it does not 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.190
 fails to 5 volts 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.530
 oxidation color of us remained the same 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.330
 besides, nitrites are increased a hundred times 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.910
 will appoint there is a serious risk of development 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.440
 malignant tumors beyond that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.240
 there are concerns that to these indicators 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.190
 other dangerous ones may be added 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.260
 substances this filter and hardly anyone 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.510
 will often change because at home 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.950
 consumption will fall great we are very dirty 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.260
 pipes you know it and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.900
 we have this one iron first 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.220
 goes dissolved and then when she 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.960
 it takes some time to start 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.880
 fall out that's why we decided 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.830
 check the collective filter which 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.690
 two years standing on another house 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.850
 filtered water recruited 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.250
 special packaging and send for analysis 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.290
 chemists were right the picture is the same as 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.390
 in the new building only this time in the water 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.580
 the second is increased the amount of chloroform 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.560
 experts state using regularly 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.490
 this liquid can get a whole bunch 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.780
 diseases 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.850
 to avoid such consequences 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.040
 most of the Urals are willing to spend 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.870
 a lot of money so the next one 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.299
 the list to check the most expensive among 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.160
 fixed positioning filter for filter 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.830
 it turns out we purchased when moved 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.230
 their apartments a year ago and to taste it 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.900
 different kiddies let you sing said that 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.390
 can such a filter can do without 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.580
 68 thousand citizens plus a removable cassette 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
 order 2000 high cost 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.530
 the manufacturer will be acquitted 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.669
 filtration rate of 50 liters per hour 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.260
 efficiency of the apparatus it can clear 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.139
 water from chlorine pesticides and 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.210
 petroleum products 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.580
 we collect liquid bottles we send 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.590
 laboratory even appin plumbing 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.870
 water and it corresponds to but to the ideal 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.669
 her away in the first half 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.249
 oxidation values 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.990
 habitually chromatic chloroform in addition 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.120
 7 times compared to higher water 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:07.400
 category exceeded the amount of nitrite 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:09.889
 recently become popular 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.319
 also portable or portable filters 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.509
 especially among athletes this apparatus 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.580
 quite simple plastic bottle + 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.990
 plug- in mug by words 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.360
 manufacturer such a unit is capable 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.939
 destroy 99 percent of all bacteria 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.919
 heavy metals and improve the taste not 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.689
 Hurry up to believe in a word I recruit 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.520
 water for analysis for such a filter 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.339
 better use approved 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.319
 water canal water well that is from the tap 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.900
 we take a sample to the lab we 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.919
 the result does not have to wait long 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.240
 despite the fact that the requirements 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.219
 tap water is liquid 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.110
 corresponds to sanpin and higher water 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.330
 quality it turns out to be color 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.310
 besides 2 usual indicator 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.990
 chloroform is truly quality 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.620
 drinking water we allowed it very 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.960
 little one microgram in a liter here goes 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.599
 excess than fingering forum he has 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.259
 their remote consequences in the form of 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.029
 carcinogenic effect pathogenic well 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.370
 some others still extra 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.919
 adverse effects 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.319
 the result no filter even dear could 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.240
 bring water to drinking state but 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.310
 Despite this, most of the Urals 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.199
 believes in such a unit remaining 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.149
 prefers to buy bottled water 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.339
 is it possible to drink it without fear for 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:21.169
 your own health will find out in the next 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.479
 series on the study get four 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.099
