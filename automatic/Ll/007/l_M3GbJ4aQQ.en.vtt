00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
happening I'm going to take the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
happening I'm going to take the
jalapenos<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:24.090> basically<00:02:24.270> just

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
jalapenos here and you basically just

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.810 
jalapenos here and you basically just
want<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.959> cut<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.650> end<00:02:25.860> off<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.580> pull

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
want to cut the end off and then pull

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.340 
want to cut the end off and then pull
the<00:02:26.970> seeds<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.450> run<00:02:27.810> some<00:02:28.020> water<00:02:28.050> through

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the seeds out run some water through

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.740 
the seeds out run some water through
there<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.520> basically<00:02:30.150> end<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.540> with

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there so you basically end up with

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
there so you basically end up with
something<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.830> then<00:02:32.430> you're

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
something like this and then you're

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.759 
something like this and then you're
going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.880> slicing<00:02:33.360> these<00:02:33.780> into<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.530> an

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
going to be slicing these into about an

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.160 
going to be slicing these into about an
eighth<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.750> an<00:02:37.140> inch<00:02:37.290> thick<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.959> let<00:02:39.959> me<00:02:40.050> go

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
eighth of an inch thick so let me go

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
eighth of an inch thick so let me go
ahead<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.380> get<00:02:40.470> started<00:02:40.739> on<00:02:40.980> those<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.640> then

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
ahead and get started on those and then

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.830 
ahead and get started on those and then
we'll<00:02:42.000> pick<00:02:42.300> back<00:02:42.330> up<00:02:42.620> once<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.760> syrup<00:02:45.690> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
we'll pick back up once the the syrup is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.540 
we'll pick back up once the the syrup is
right

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
right

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.820 
right
okay<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:47.700> been<00:02:47.880> about<00:02:47.940> eight<00:02:48.840> minutes<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
okay it's been about eight minutes and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.350 
okay it's been about eight minutes and
the<00:02:52.459> syrup<00:02:53.459> here<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.500> already<00:02:55.940> got<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.090> nice

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the syrup here is already got this nice

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.009 
the syrup here is already got this nice

and heated up and got the jalapenos all
sliced<00:03:01.560> up<00:03:01.860> again<00:03:02.280> about<00:03:02.519> quarter<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.480> an<00:03:03.690> inch

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870

a little bit and what we're going to do
now<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.190> let<00:03:17.850> these<00:03:18.180> simmer<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:19.049> about<00:03:19.170> ten

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
now is let these simmer for about ten

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.330 
now is let these simmer for about ten
minutes<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.670> we're<00:03:21.000> looking<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.660> to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
minutes all we're looking for is just to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
minutes all we're looking for is just to
let<00:03:23.340> these<00:03:23.519> jalapeno<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.540> soften<00:03:25.049> up<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
let these jalapeno just soften up just a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.900 
let these jalapeno just soften up just a
little<00:03:25.650> bit<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.250> then<00:03:26.370> we'll<00:03:26.489> pick<00:03:26.700> back<00:03:26.850> up

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
little bit and then we'll pick back up

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.509 
little bit and then we'll pick back up
when<00:03:27.269> they're<00:03:27.450> ready<00:03:28.190> alright<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:29.459> been

when they're ready alright it's been
about<00:03:29.850> ten<00:03:30.209> minutes<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> we'll<00:03:33.180> go<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.540> take

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
about ten minutes and we'll go and take

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.180 
about ten minutes and we'll go and take
a<00:03:33.720> look<00:03:33.989> at<00:03:34.079> these<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.680> see<00:03:34.920> that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
a look at these and you can see that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.060 
a look at these and you can see that
they're<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.500> getting<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:38.040> little

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
they're just now getting just a little

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.699 
they're just now getting just a little
bit<00:03:38.459> soft<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.380> what<00:03:40.560> we're

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
bit soft and so this is what we're

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.229 
bit soft and so this is what we're
looking<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.220> don't<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:41.820> want<00:03:42.150> them

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
looking for you don't really want them

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.729 
looking for you don't really want them
any<00:03:42.360> softer<00:03:42.840> than<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.019> because<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.500> still

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
any softer than this because we still

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.170 
any softer than this because we still
want<00:03:43.799> them<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.579> bit<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.910> crunch

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
want them to have a little bit of crunch

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.720 
want them to have a little bit of crunch
to<00:03:45.360> them<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.620> idea<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.459> take<00:03:47.700> a

to them the idea here is just take a
take<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.420> mason<00:03:48.870> jar<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.609> you<00:03:50.609> want<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.650> put

take a mason jar and you want to put

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.180 
take a mason jar and you want to put
these<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.980> mason<00:03:53.220> jar<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.560> leave<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:56.130> of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
these in a mason jar and leave all of

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.590 
these in a mason jar and leave all of
the<00:03:57.200> syrup<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.760> pan<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.329> I'll<00:04:00.420> go<00:04:00.540> ahead

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
the syrup and the pan so I'll go ahead

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.119 
the syrup and the pan so I'll go ahead
and<00:04:00.810> scoop<00:04:01.050> all<00:04:01.230> these<00:04:01.440> out<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.040> I'll

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
pick right back up okay we've got all of

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.710 
pick right back up okay we've got all of
our<00:04:06.209> haul<00:04:06.420> up

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
our haul up

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.470 
our haul up
is<00:04:07.020> out<00:04:07.290> into<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.830> mason<00:04:08.250> jar<00:04:08.460> we're<00:04:09.300> going<00:04:09.420> to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
is out into the mason jar we're going to

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.800 
is out into the mason jar we're going to
do<00:04:09.600> now<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:10.370> since<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.700> syrup<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.540> still

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
do now is since the syrup is still

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.860 
do now is since the syrup is still
really<00:04:13.200> thin<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.490> point<00:04:14.820> what<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.570> do<00:04:15.720> is

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
really thin at this point what you do is

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.720 
really thin at this point what you do is
just<00:04:16.049> go<00:04:16.170> ahead<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.500> crank<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.980> heat<00:04:17.190> back<00:04:17.700> up

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
just go ahead and crank the heat back up

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.140 
just go ahead and crank the heat back up
to<00:04:18.090> high<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.560> going<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> low<00:04:20.760> boil

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
to high and get this going to a low boil

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.110 
to high and get this going to a low boil
and<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:22.019> want<00:04:22.230> this<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.410> boil<00:04:22.800> for<00:04:23.340> six<00:04:23.940> or

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
and you want this to boil for six or

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.110 
and you want this to boil for six or
seven<00:04:24.480> minutes<00:04:24.630> or<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.140> until<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:26.280> reduces

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
seven minutes or so until this reduces

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.750 
seven minutes or so until this reduces
down<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.870> nice<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.410> thick<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.950> I've<00:04:29.550> got

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
down and is nice and thick so I've got

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.160 
down and is nice and thick so I've got
the<00:04:29.880> heat<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.090> high<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.450> we'll<00:04:30.720> pick<00:04:30.930> back<00:04:31.110> up

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
the heat on high and we'll pick back up

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.340 
the heat on high and we'll pick back up
once<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.890> is<00:04:32.070> thickened<00:04:32.490> up<00:04:32.870> all<00:04:33.870> right<00:04:34.080> it's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
once this is thickened up all right it's

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.040 
once this is thickened up all right it's
been<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.860> seven<00:04:35.280> eight<00:04:35.610> minutes<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.990> is

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
been about seven eight minutes this is

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.530 
been about seven eight minutes this is
reduced<00:04:37.650> down<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.070> good<00:04:38.400> bit<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.150> can<00:04:39.300> see

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
reduced down a good bit so you can see

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.460 
reduced down a good bit so you can see
here<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:40.710> kind<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.720> playing<00:04:42.720> into<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.200> spoon

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
here it's kind of playing into the spoon

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.160 
here it's kind of playing into the spoon
a<00:04:43.500> little<00:04:43.710> bit<00:04:44.160> thickened<00:04:45.060> up<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:45.960> I'm<00:04:46.050> going

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
a little bit thickened up so I'm going

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.060 
a little bit thickened up so I'm going
to<00:04:46.200> go<00:04:46.320> ahead<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.590> cut<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.890> heat<00:04:47.100> on<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.490> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
to go ahead and cut the heat on this and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.120 
to go ahead and cut the heat on this and
we'll<00:04:50.070> pick<00:04:50.280> back<00:04:50.460> up<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.880> just<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.180> second<00:04:51.630> okay

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
we'll pick back up in just a second okay

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.410 
we'll pick back up in just a second okay
now<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.460> cooled<00:04:53.850> down<00:04:53.940> just<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.390> little

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
now this is cooled down just a little

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.740 
now this is cooled down just a little
bit<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.080> see<00:04:55.250> just<00:04:56.250> how<00:04:56.720> thick<00:04:57.720> that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
bit you can see just how thick that

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.970 
bit you can see just how thick that
syrup<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:59.690> really<00:05:00.690> six<00:05:01.080> seven<00:05:01.470> minutes<00:05:01.590> was

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
syrup is so really six seven minutes was

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.900 
syrup is so really six seven minutes was
all<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:03.000> really<00:05:03.300> needed<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.690> boil<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.290> at<00:05:04.440> so

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
all we really needed to boil it at so

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.360 
all we really needed to boil it at so
definitely<00:05:05.910> make<00:05:06.270> sure<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.600> don't<00:05:07.190> boil<00:05:08.190> it

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
definitely make sure you don't boil it

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.090 
definitely make sure you don't boil it
down<00:05:08.400> too<00:05:08.700> far<00:05:09.000> or<00:05:09.419> it'll<00:05:09.870> get<00:05:10.050> you'll<00:05:10.830> lose<00:05:11.070> a

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
down too far or it'll get you'll lose a

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.370 
down too far or it'll get you'll lose a
lot<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.520> this<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:11.940> that's<00:05:12.840> what<00:05:13.020> we're<00:05:13.140> looking

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
lot of this so that's what we're looking

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.120 
lot of this so that's what we're looking
for<00:05:13.410> right<00:05:13.620> there<00:05:15.230> so<00:05:16.230> let<00:05:16.470> me<00:05:16.590> go<00:05:16.770> ahead<00:05:16.830> and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
for right there so let me go ahead and

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.630 
for right there so let me go ahead and
slide<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.820> side<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:20.220> we're<00:05:20.610> just

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
slide that to the side and we're just

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:34.480 
slide that to the side and we're just
going<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.000> take<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:24.410> dump<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:25.710> in

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.970 

just<00:05:35.490> like<00:05:35.670> that<00:05:37.940> all<00:05:38.940> right<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
just like that all right and so the

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.540 
just like that all right and so the
trick<00:05:41.220> is<00:05:41.400> now<00:05:42.410> once<00:05:43.410> this<00:05:43.620> cools<00:05:43.980> off<00:05:44.250> what

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
trick is now once this cools off what

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.760 
trick is now once this cools off what
you<00:05:44.700> want<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:44.970> do<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.450> let<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.110> sit<00:05:46.470> in<00:05:46.650> the

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
you want to do is let this sit in the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.450 
you want to do is let this sit in the
fridge<00:05:47.070> for<00:05:47.910> at<00:05:48.900> least<00:05:48.960> 2<00:05:49.260> weeks<00:05:49.620> closer<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.430> a

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
fridge for at least 2 weeks closer to a

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.900 
fridge for at least 2 weeks closer to a
month<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:51.180> just<00:05:51.630> let<00:05:52.260> them<00:05:52.440> sit<00:05:53.220> there<00:05:53.430> in<00:05:53.730> the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
month and just let them sit there in the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.570 
month and just let them sit there in the
syrup<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.540> get<00:05:54.990> good<00:05:55.200> and<00:05:55.440> candied<00:05:55.920> you<00:05:56.370> can

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
syrup and get good and candied you can

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.100 
syrup and get good and candied you can
go<00:05:56.820> ahead<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.180> start<00:05:57.390> them<00:05:57.570> now<00:05:57.720> that'll<00:05:58.080> be

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
go ahead and start them now that'll be

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.010 
go ahead and start them now that'll be
fine<00:05:58.410> but<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.710> longer<00:05:59.040> they<00:05:59.190> sit<00:05:59.250> the<00:06:00.240> sweeter

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
fine but the longer they sit the sweeter

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.930 
fine but the longer they sit the sweeter
they'll<00:06:01.260> be<00:06:01.410> in<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.650> thicker<00:06:01.890> that<00:06:02.220> syrup

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
they'll be in the thicker that syrup

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.360 
they'll be in the thicker that syrup
will<00:06:03.060> be<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:03.570> that's<00:06:04.380> really<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:04.890> pretty

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
will be so that's really it pretty

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.610 
will be so that's really it pretty
