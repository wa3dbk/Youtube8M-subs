00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.720
 we are here on earth 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.999
 we are committed to living to do some 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.070
 which seems important to us not 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:15.299
 we know what but we have to do it 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.590
 we are in a hurry there are priorities 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.000
 we like all this 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.570
 sometimes yes sometimes we go by 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.670
 satisfactions sometimes not we do not like 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.380
 and then the problem becomes understanding 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.439
 because we're here what we're doing 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.609
 why we are doing it and why not 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.160
 like it 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.129
 I tell you you can understand all this 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.530
 above all, one can understand how to live 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.940
 better the life that is the question 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.460
 essential 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.820
 we are engaged in a living activity 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.739
 on earth that needs explanation 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.800
 if we don't understand where we are going 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.449
 the first thing we need is to understand how 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.070
 live life better for us human beings 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:03.910
 like to be admired we make ourselves beautiful 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.869
 we take care of the appearance c comb we polish 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.630
 shoes or we put aussie in the nose 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.659
 this depends on the culture to which we are 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.570
 we belong and to reach the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.049
 maximum of the authority we exhibit 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.720
 educational qualifications or game that 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.340
 we have captured depends on culture 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.070
 to which we belong 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.890
 we do all this because we like it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.130
 we like our pirate rams that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.040
 people say about us or how beautiful or not 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.140
 but how good he is you drink the aussies here 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.780
 which he stuck into his nose 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.570
 oh how nice that bachelor 's degree that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.390
 there is there attached to the wall to us 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 be two i like this like to come 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.860
 admire everything we go for 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.350
 proud of it when 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.490
 we use this is a very concept 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.640
 important what you do that you like 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 what you are proud of is worth in 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 the moment you are using it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.470
 in the restricted environment that recognizes you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.530
 that tells you how beautiful you are 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.020
 beautiful those meanings in your nose 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.440
 carry around 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.430
 if we remain convinced for a long time and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.300
 everywhere those shiny shoes those 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.170
 aussie in the nose that diploma that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.020
 game caught with our weapons 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.810
 if we are convinced that they express their own 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.910
 we our essence then we become 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.690
 prisoners of a nightmare that does not 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.970
 we dismantle and we get sick you 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.970
 think before we are happy because 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.040
 we got a bachelor's degree 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.680
 because we caught a rabbit 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.430
 because we put the aussies in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.650
 nose because we have polished the shoes 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.800
 it seems to us that that is the maximum that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.730
 we can do because they told us or but 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.000
 how good you are at doing these things but 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.450
 if we believe that doing those things 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.460
 fully express our essence 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.940
 then we become prisoners of a 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:28.320
 nightmare that they don't know how to disassemble and there 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.280
 sick the root of the diseases 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.570
 all diseases is believing to be a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.550
 physical body a body that needs 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:45.420
 a long list of food items 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.330
 shelter yourself dress have fun if you 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.050
 you believe you are only the one of 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.310
 animals if we address all of yours 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.810
 caution 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.260
 there in the body then it remains blocked 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.020
 in the illusion of matter and not you 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.110
 explain why you live and ca n't 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.360
 to grasp spiritual messages in the sense 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.450
 spiritual there are messages that 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.209
 they constantly remind you and you are not 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 a body if you and observe your way 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.670
 to reason that you would say 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.430
 your looking at yours to reason not 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.230
 only a body expression depends on 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.570
 it depends on where you put yours 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:33.180
 attention to live better life 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:38.550
 approach life with respect 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.770
 look to learn how things work out 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.100
 on the physical plane 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.160
 born apparently out of nowhere e 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.860
 arrive to express a role 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.670
 which suggests that this role 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.950
 so well harmonized in the world both 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:01.830
 was conceived at 39 and with foresight 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.320
 it seems if it cost him his life if he can 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.140
 be there a nature and if you understand that 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.000
 things that seem born out of nowhere in 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:15.380
 reality combine with each other in harmony 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.180
 perhaps it occurs to you that there is a plan 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.630
 harmonious and that plan was 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.710
 conceived by an intelligence it was 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:30.180
 conceived elsewhere was conceived with 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.900
 foresight with intention to do e 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.200
 then look at these things 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.850
 life to learn approached to life 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.870
 with respect 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:46.770
 in this way you get to live better 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:49.890
 look at new reflect you feel life

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.760
 admiration beyond the fact that you

 graduate diplomas in the nose or that 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.270
 hangs the aussie on the walls could
