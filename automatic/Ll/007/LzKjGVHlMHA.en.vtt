windshield and only buffed out one side

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.350 
windshield and only buffed out one side
I<00:00:50.540> buffed<00:00:50.930> out<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:51.320> side<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.090> then<00:00:53.090> this

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
I buffed out this side and then this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.540 
I buffed out this side and then this
side<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.809> exactly<00:00:54.380> how<00:00:54.620> all<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.100> paint<00:00:55.340> looked

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
side is exactly how all the paint looked

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.090 
side is exactly how all the paint looked
on<00:00:55.700> this<00:00:55.850> car<00:00:56.149> got<00:00:56.329> here<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.559> as<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:57.860> can<00:00:58.040> see

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
on this car got here and as you can see

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.130 
on this car got here and as you can see
there's<00:00:58.850> definitely<00:00:59.629> a<00:01:01.510> darkness<00:01:02.510> here<00:01:02.899> and

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
there's definitely a darkness here and

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.130 
there's definitely a darkness here and
that<00:01:03.320> darkness<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:04.129> embedded<00:01:04.759> dirt<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.960> it's

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
that darkness is embedded dirt so it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.380 
that darkness is embedded dirt so it's
embedded<00:01:06.710> not<00:01:06.950> only<00:01:07.160> on<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.610> paint<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:08.270> at

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
embedded not only on the paint but at

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.499 
embedded not only on the paint but at
some<00:01:08.600> level<00:01:08.710> into<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.740> pain<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:11.240> after

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
some level into the pain and so after

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.460 
some level into the pain and so after
machine<00:01:11.869> polishing<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.910> restored<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.000> bright

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
machine polishing I restored a bright

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.160 
machine polishing I restored a bright
yellow<00:01:15.470> color<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.840> where<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:17.869> haven't

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
yellow color and where I haven't

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.779

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
polished that you can see this film of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.520 
polished that you can see this film of
dirt<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.330> still<00:01:20.660> bonded<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.259> paint

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
dirt that is still bonded to the paint

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.609 
dirt that is still bonded to the paint
now<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.130> did<00:01:22.789> clay<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> wiped<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.410> car

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
now I did clay this so I wiped the car

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.529 
now I did clay this so I wiped the car
clean<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.069> remove<00:01:25.340> loose<00:01:25.550> dirt<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.179> clade

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
clean to remove loose dirt then I clade

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.630 
clean to remove loose dirt then I clade
it<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.959> remove<00:01:27.200> above<00:01:27.679> surface<00:01:27.979> bonnet

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
it to remove above surface bonnet

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.180 
it to remove above surface bonnet
contaminants<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:30.349> I<00:01:30.410> have<00:01:30.649> not<00:01:30.800> machine

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
contaminants but I have not machine

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.249 
contaminants but I have not machine
polished<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.390> has<00:01:32.599> been<00:01:32.780> polished

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
polished this and this has been polished

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.940 
polished this and this has been polished
and<00:01:33.440> that's<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.280> difference<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:35.800> what<00:01:36.800> you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
and that's the difference in what you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.650 
and that's the difference in what you
can<00:01:37.130> do<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.490> machine<00:01:38.000> polish<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.630> can

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
can do and you machine polish you can

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.540 
can do and you machine polish you can
remove<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.050> layer<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.500> embedded<00:01:40.190> dirt<00:01:40.369> now

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
remove that layer of embedded dirt now

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.040 
remove that layer of embedded dirt now
let<00:01:40.670> me<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:40.940> kind<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.209> scroll<00:01:41.599> back<00:01:41.869> and

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
let me just kind of scroll back and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.620 
let me just kind of scroll back and
forth<00:01:42.140> here<00:01:42.679> also<00:01:43.550> amps<00:01:44.119> up<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.270> gloss<00:01:44.599> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
forth here also amps up the gloss and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.090 
forth here also amps up the gloss and
the<00:01:44.899> clarity<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.470> reflection

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.740 

anyway<00:01:52.100> that's<00:01:52.220> called<00:01:52.580> embedded<00:01:53.090> dirt<00:01:53.479> or

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
anyway that's called embedded dirt or

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.789 
anyway that's called embedded dirt or
ass<00:01:54.259> dirt<00:01:54.860> staining<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.170> keep<00:01:57.439> in<00:01:57.590> mind

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
ass dirt staining and and keep in mind

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.490 
ass dirt staining and and keep in mind
this<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> garage<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.149> street<00:01:59.570> rod<00:01:59.810> okay

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
this is a garage to the street rod okay

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.249 
this is a garage to the street rod okay
so<00:02:01.189> over<00:02:01.280> time<00:02:01.549> if<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:02.000> cars<00:02:02.360> getting<00:02:02.659> dirty

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
so over time if this cars getting dirty

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.469 
so over time if this cars getting dirty
just<00:02:04.040> think<00:02:04.250> how<00:02:04.399> dirty<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.790> car<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.270> is

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
just think how dirty a car that is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.199 
just think how dirty a car that is
driven<00:02:06.320> every<00:02:06.530> day<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.039> work<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.700> did<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:07.970> same

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
driven every day to work I did the same

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.080 
driven every day to work I did the same
thing<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.690> side<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:10.489> side<00:02:10.550> has<00:02:10.850> been

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
thing on this side this side has been

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.930 
thing on this side this side has been
polished<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.890> side<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.130> put<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.400> tape<00:02:13.670> line

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
polished and this side I put a tape line

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.170 
polished and this side I put a tape line
down<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:15.319> not<00:02:15.500> as<00:02:15.620> apparent<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
down here it's not as apparent but it's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.479 
down here it's not as apparent but it's
still<00:02:17.420> there<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.560> if<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.069> drive<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.430> car

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
still there but if you drive your car

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.840
