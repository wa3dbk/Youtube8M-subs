be rather jarring and also you get like
a<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.820> shudder<00:01:54.149> through<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> steering

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
a kind of shudder through the steering

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.280 
a kind of shudder through the steering
wheel<00:01:55.939> another<00:01:56.939> criticism<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
wheel another criticism I have is the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.840 
wheel another criticism I have is the
driving<00:01:58.560> position<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.460> while<00:01:59.640> there's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
driving position because while there's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
driving position because while there's
lots<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> adjustment<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> steering<00:02:01.110> wheel

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
lots of adjustment in the steering wheel

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
lots of adjustment in the steering wheel
and<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.770> driver's<00:02:02.250> seat<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.790> offset<00:02:03.420> pedals

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and the driver's seat the offset pedals

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
and the driver's seat the offset pedals
means<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.500> feel<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.159> twisted

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
means you feel it a little bit twisted

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
means you feel it a little bit twisted
also<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> really

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
also you have to really

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
also you have to really
for<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> gearstick<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.030> leaned<00:02:09.420> forward<00:02:09.990> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
for the gearstick and leaned forward to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900 
for the gearstick and leaned forward to
operate<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> stereo<00:02:11.069> although<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> could

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
operate the stereo although that could

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.559 
operate the stereo although that could
just<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.810> an<00:02:12.900> odd<00:02:13.020> shaped<00:02:13.319> body

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.020

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
if you follow me into the back I'll show

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.309 
if you follow me into the back I'll show
you<00:02:21.120> some<00:02:21.300> other<00:02:21.450> problems<00:02:23.900> now

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
you some other problems now

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.180 
you some other problems now
well<00:02:26.060> Headroom<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.209> pretty<00:02:27.959> generous<00:02:28.440> knee

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
room is not so and I'll illustrate that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
room is not so and I'll illustrate that
with<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.400> Apple<00:02:32.760> because<00:02:33.150> there's<00:02:33.660> barely

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
with this Apple because there's barely

with this Apple because there's barely
room<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.319> between<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:34.650> knee<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
room for it between my knee and the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
chair in front wasn't a focus or a golf

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
chair in front wasn't a focus or a golf
there<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.130> space<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.790> melon

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
there be space for a melon

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.250 
there be space for a melon
another<00:02:39.989> problem<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> driver<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
another problem is for the driver this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.380 
another problem is for the driver this
big<00:02:43.260> back<00:02:43.500> panel<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.160> get<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.640> while

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
big back panel can get in the way while

big back panel can get in the way while
you're<00:02:45.420> reversing<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> then<00:02:46.860> there<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you're reversing and then there is the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.680 
you're reversing and then there is the
not<00:02:47.400> too<00:02:47.519> small<00:02:47.760> matter<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.300> depreciation

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
not too small matter of depreciation

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.350 
not too small matter of depreciation
because<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.680> 308<00:02:50.040> won't<00:02:50.910> hold<00:02:51.090> its<00:02:51.300> value

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
because the 308 won't hold its value

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.740 
because the 308 won't hold its value
particularly<00:02:52.200> well<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:54.540> want<00:02:54.690> to
