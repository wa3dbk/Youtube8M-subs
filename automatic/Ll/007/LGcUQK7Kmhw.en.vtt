00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello to you the adventurer in this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.710
 first number month the teacher 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.690
 martinez 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 I will explain to you how to improve a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.289
 must exercise at any event 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 athletic 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.949
 the post match interview here is my 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 method 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 the interview is this exercise that the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 journalists love and that athletes 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 dread for marc you surprise me that they 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 dread you just hit a 10000 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.969
 meters against Kenyans on motivated 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 running at the speed of a moped 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 left with a popolino and there arises a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 dude he arrives ask if it's all right 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 ok if you 're happy with me 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 suspects French sportsmen to do 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 shit just to avoid 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.170
 nelson I'm first I'm walked 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 bedside the win this race age 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.879
 no no it's nelson during not him in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 no no we want to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.120
 nelson dilain no no in motion and the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.469
 problem is that but who ran 90 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.210
 minutes in the cold can not we 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.070
 do an explanation of thesis text 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.550
 antithesis synthesis in the purest 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.060
 rimbaud style 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.650
 m how to ask the question how 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.660
 improve post-match interviews 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.370
 and a post-match interview it's 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.490
 often as exciting as a movie 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.900
 Uzbek on the life of Michael Jackson 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 in short there are several categories of 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.280
 interviews that can be summarized by 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.980
 the footballers themselves the best 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.200
 there is one if the guy who loses foot in 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.010
 everything he says what sense because and it's 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.290
 on this tone announcing a star from the back 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.090
 of which we know there is the guy who will fuck 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.700
 all French expressions must 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.360
 we all shoot in the same boat 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.030
 genius is a reflection that must 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.240
 think a lot and finally the guy a 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.710
 little bit shocking anyway and at 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.750
 middle of all this nothingness 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 oh yeah that's to believe that sportsmen 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.930
 and other footballers are programmed 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.970
 since they are small to fair and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.490
 all the interviews he gives he was 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.200
 Here thus conquered so what that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.480
 is important in what I just 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.910
 describe here I like helping the end the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.060
 three points because the important thing is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.890
 the three points to here so young 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.080
 sports an infallible method and in 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.230
 three steps to never again 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.790
 stop interview given that the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.800
 majority of journalists pose 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.190
 stupid questions 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.190
 for example 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 my body who are the good ones you are 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.910
 need to raise the level because even though the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.070
 question is stupid 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.170
 we will only remember the answer on 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.760
 professor martinez's advice it's from 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.310
 do you make a little sentence that type 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.320
 you'll come out by adapting it from 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.670
 different way each time like the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.890
 Commissioner via lets listen 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.910
 let the police do their job as soon as 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.770
 I will have more information 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.130
 believe it, you'll be the first ones 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.260
 informed 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.210
 here is a scenario of the stage 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 number one this world cup you the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.310
 wanted side yes it's a turning point in 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.840
 career I will have them you are whore 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.670
 and the cruciate ligaments it hurts 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 vote yes it's a turning point in my 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.180
 career I'm disgusted you have 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
 lying with a prostitute there you are 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.050
 married to date yes side it's a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.400
 turning in my career I all 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:28.570
 irritated by what we do not talk like that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.730
 that in a parallel world where the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.200
 bescherelle does not exist there is no 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.600
 a quality that makes it now 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.550
 must the cvo lucio nose it is important 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.630
 to master the more than perfect or 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.220
 still the subjunctive 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.680
 for that, nothing like a good 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.350
 training and especially repetition 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.000
 gestures 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.350
 the first person plural you do 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.940
 to boil to simple past 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.070
 the new llaves would have angry do not forget 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.360
 ever next strike him but because 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:06.300
 convince more than sometimes the standard 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:07.860
