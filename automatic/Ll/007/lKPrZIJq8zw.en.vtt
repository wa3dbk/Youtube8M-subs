00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.279
 new edition grape gambles at the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.279
 ass off 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.700
 Of course I have the whole format 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 changed again and always do 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.600
 That's why I'll go now 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.739
 a few things you do not test that way 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.329
 simply test channel the snout 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.710
 journey there are a few demos that 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.480
 not here in the german store 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.100
 but can get in the us store or too 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.690
 free to play games and there I have it 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 a free-to-play picked out for you 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.879
 namely sportxx legends that is if 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.710
 it is now downloaded 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.449
 so long as I am now also one 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.839
 red yes it has a very synonymous by the way 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.579
 good reason why I turn this way 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.500
 taken and even 270 reasons firstly 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.300
 that will follow 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.559
 that's really nice Holzkugel and her 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.330
 can you still see what now 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.610
 not about the advantage and reason 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.170
 number two i have no idea how 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 you can build identical and television 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 coupling solved by making the komik now 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.830
 so 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:25.759
 I 'll do it all the same 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:27.320
 a little bit of it will become videos 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.539
 Incidentally, in the future of total useless 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.820
 because on the s4 it will be the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.010
 give share button and there you will be with 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 can control everything at the push of a button 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.640
 then again I can watch my 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.230
 opinion after not such a great one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.390
 invention but i know or too 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.640
 just once to try it to me 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.890
 picture 4 today and do not ask me 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 always on xbox or ps3 or what knows 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.860
 I should everyone for themselves 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.690
 know, the battle of the console is 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.520
 of course with the next gen buggy 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.900
 I completely want to do monitoring 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.030
 They both in their own way 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.070
 everyone must see what exclusive titles 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.930
 he wants to have so I do not want 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.160
 That's why I'll renounce uncharted 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.140
 me of course a playstation 4 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.080
 Nights and functions are natural 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.210
 both can be absolutely no idea what 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.940
 I'm expecting these free to play games 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.170
 which abound in america work 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.610
 Similar to the mobile games 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.350
 you can see that the game is down for free 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.300
 and you can get some coins here 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.190
 to buy or buy the weapons can be so 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.010
 the armor and all such a shit though 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.350
 nice why this could not be 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.240
 Load and it grabs the side and I know 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.490
 find shit and upstream and 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.680
 will not install soon either 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.510
 so there was never I have at least 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.920
 belongs to the playstation exactly like that 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.450
 I do not know supposedly 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.940
 can you download it from the stand 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.860
 You can start while playing 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.480
 the rest will be installed as is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.270
 It's all right if it does 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.489
 be no idea that jobs was currently 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.340
 quite off after three pieces all 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.260
 somehow have defects 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.330
 the key lengerich.de now 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.569
 washed out so clean ok everything 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.360
 Of course we can start 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.920
 no, this later ask so and now 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.920
 no longer has to gamble for you 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.920
 Euro 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.099
 yes blood and guts that sounds so good 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.380
 as long as you wait victims like god yes 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.380
 maybe not just 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.019
 the way it looks like is the service in 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.019
 Germany not yet available 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.930
 we tried it but as 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.410
 reparation 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.000
 if you act exactly , people are 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.620
 is yes times fully gone into the pants yes 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.040
 that's the technology you're not stuck with 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.250
 in it 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 not even how to get to and around that 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.850
 make up for a small one again 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.500
 detail of kingston who it yet 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.000
 I have not known for some time 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.810
 recommend to buy that's right 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.430
 fun 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.540
 you do nothing but objects 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.540
 take and throw at the opponent 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.330
 So if you start crashing things 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.110
 which group is smaller and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.290
 Accordingly, what the good run 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.290
 made 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.390
 is working 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.360
 Oh that's funny or laughing 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.110
 actually a lot of fun 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.419
 I'm still mad austerity agency 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:27.129
 this worked for me this time 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:27.129
 and next time comes the game over
