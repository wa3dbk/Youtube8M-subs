coughing that was bothering me more the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.140 
coughing that was bothering me more the
sore<00:02:31.030> throat<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.510> was<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.200> done<00:02:32.410> issue<00:02:33.150> but

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
sore throat that was just done issue but

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.140 
sore throat that was just done issue but
it<00:02:34.390> sure<00:02:34.630> beats<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.350> last<00:02:35.530> time<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.310> think<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it sure beats the last time I think it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.720 
it sure beats the last time I think it

don't really see family on Christmas Day

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
don't really see family on Christmas Day
I<00:03:07.840> always<00:03:08.230> see<00:03:08.410> my<00:03:08.560> cousins<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.130> Christmas<00:03:09.610> Eve

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
I always see my cousins on Christmas Eve

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.680 
I always see my cousins on Christmas Eve
and<00:03:10.150> we<00:03:10.750> have<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> soup<00:03:11.530> tradition<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.690> good

and we have a soup tradition and good
thing<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.140> she<00:03:14.350> always<00:03:14.560> makes<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.160> ton<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
thing that she always makes a ton of

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.940 
thing that she always makes a ton of
extras<00:03:16.030> because<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.660> was<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.690> sick<00:03:20.290> me<00:03:20.799> and

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
my parents we all were that's like the

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.340 
my parents we all were that's like the
worst<00:03:24.700> time<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.420> sick<00:03:25.780> when<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.170> have

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
worst time to get sick when you have

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.940 
worst time to get sick when you have
time<00:03:26.739> off<00:03:27.600> but<00:03:28.600> I'm<00:03:28.750> feeling<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.470> little<00:03:29.739> bit

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
time off but I'm feeling a little bit

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.550 
time off but I'm feeling a little bit
better<00:03:30.160> -<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.880> extensive<00:03:31.570> cough<00:03:31.810> drops

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
better - the extensive cough drops

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.130 
better - the extensive cough drops
ah<00:03:35.010> I'm<00:03:36.010> lost

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
ah I'm lost

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.509 
ah I'm lost
it's<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.260> very<00:03:38.470> winter<00:03:38.859> your<00:03:39.010> level<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.430> don't

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
it's a very winter your level I don't

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.520 
it's a very winter your level I don't
know<00:03:39.760> why<00:03:39.940> I'm<00:03:40.090> feeling<00:03:40.120> lost<00:03:40.690> because<00:03:41.290> pretty

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
know why I'm feeling lost because pretty

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.400 
know why I'm feeling lost because pretty
much<00:03:41.620> everything<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.310> straightforward<00:03:43.410> you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
much everything is straightforward you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.130 
much everything is straightforward you
basically<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.640> follow<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.209> cannons<00:03:46.690> and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
basically just follow the cannons and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.130 
basically just follow the cannons and
the<00:03:47.370> cannons<00:03:48.370> lead<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.269> places<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:50.340> woo

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
the cannons lead you to places and woo

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.599 
the cannons lead you to places and woo
if<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.290> step<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.829> switches<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.459> could

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
if you step on the switches you could

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.069 
if you step on the switches you could
get<00:03:54.700> some<00:03:54.880> extra<00:03:55.120> coins<00:03:55.540> there's<00:03:55.930> an

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
get some extra coins there's an

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.830 
get some extra coins there's an
unlimited<00:03:56.200> coin<00:03:56.920> block<00:03:57.160> somewhere<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.540> then

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
unlimited coin block somewhere and then

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.789 
unlimited coin block somewhere and then
our<00:03:58.959> last<00:03:59.140> store<00:03:59.650> metal<00:03:59.980> is<00:04:00.190> over<00:04:00.640> this<00:04:00.910> way

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
our last store metal is over this way

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.440 
our last store metal is over this way
I'm<00:04:02.799> worried<00:04:03.130> about<00:04:03.190> missing<00:04:03.880> this<00:04:04.090> platform

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
I'm worried about missing this platform

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.069 
I'm worried about missing this platform
but<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.170> cannons<00:04:05.590> are<00:04:05.769> kind<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.870> they're<00:04:07.870> not

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
but the cannons are kind of they're not

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.460 
but the cannons are kind of they're not
like<00:04:08.350> mario64<00:04:09.190> cannons<00:04:10.120> where<00:04:10.420> how<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.019> aim

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
like mario64 cannons where how you aim

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.190 
like mario64 cannons where how you aim
them<00:04:11.829> matters<00:04:12.540> oh<00:04:13.950> no<00:04:14.950> um<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:16.239> was<00:04:16.810> gonna<00:04:16.900> bring

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
them matters oh no um I was gonna bring

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.110 
them matters oh no um I was gonna bring
physics<00:04:17.709> into<00:04:18.039> this<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.760> would<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:18.970> been<00:04:19.090> a

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
physics into this that would have been a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.250 
physics into this that would have been a
hot

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.440 

via<00:04:22.650> physics<00:04:23.310> at<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.550> was<00:04:23.670> dying<00:04:23.910> like<00:04:24.090> cousin

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
via physics at I was dying like cousin

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.450 
via physics at I was dying like cousin
over<00:04:24.600> Christmas<00:04:25.200> break<00:04:25.290> he<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:26.010> two<00:04:26.250> years

older<00:04:26.850> than<00:04:26.880> they<00:04:27.240> say<00:04:27.780> he's<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.050> college<00:04:28.380> and

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
older than they say he's in college and

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.400 
older than they say he's in college and
he<00:04:29.550> was<00:04:29.580> like<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.360> was<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.690> first<00:04:31.080> thing<00:04:31.350> he

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
he was like that was the first thing he

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.760 
he was like that was the first thing he
said<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.830> me<00:04:32.220> oh<00:04:32.250> he's<00:04:32.640> like<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.210> never<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:34.530> to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
said to me oh he's like I never have to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.580 
said to me oh he's like I never have to
take<00:04:34.980> physics<00:04:35.640> again<00:04:36.090> jump<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.410> joy<00:04:37.520> oh<00:04:39.590> he

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
take physics again jump for joy oh he

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.690 
take physics again jump for joy oh he
was<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.010> happy

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
was so happy
