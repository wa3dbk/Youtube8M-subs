00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.800 
movie nice and golden brown and have a
little<00:05:11.430> bit<00:05:11.640> of<00:05:11.670> crispiness<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.600> them<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:15.540> give

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
little bit of crispiness to them so give

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:24.570 
little bit of crispiness to them so give
them<00:05:15.900> about<00:05:16.230> five<00:05:16.500> more<00:05:16.740> minutes

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.860 

things<00:05:25.449> are<00:05:25.629> done<00:05:25.840> now<00:05:27.240> place<00:05:28.240> this<00:05:28.389> block<00:05:28.659> of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
things are done now place this block of

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.559 
things are done now place this block of
wood<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.610> I<00:05:30.639> can<00:05:30.759> tip<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.150> pan

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
wood here so that I can tip the pan

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.360 
wood here so that I can tip the pan
slightly<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.289> that<00:05:32.409> allows<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.919> grease<00:05:33.159> to

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
slightly and that allows the grease to

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.709 
slightly and that allows the grease to
run<00:05:33.550> down<00:05:33.759> to<00:05:33.939> the<00:05:34.030> edge<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:37.060> makes<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.360> easier

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
run down to the edge it makes it easier

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.580 
run down to the edge it makes it easier
