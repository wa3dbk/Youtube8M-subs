00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.500
 Hi, it's me, uh, how are you and how are you? 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.570
 I hope it's great and today we like it 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.269
 micro and I am with the camera of my mobile 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.710
 so sorry for the quality but it's 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.380
 that in fact the camera of the same mobile 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.859
 It has better quality than the camera that 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 I have and recorded with the mobile and here 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.310
 we have the box of fear what was 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.710
 so well because I 've already placed it because 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.000
 it came very well packaged and it's going to be a 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.819
 package her pussy so what 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.370
 unpacked already here as you can see 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:40.019
 made a hack with goat camera 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.280
 this shit that I tell you I have placed 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.570
 with a piece of paper here to enter 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.270
 Spider pressure him 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.480
 of the micro I have placed the micro I've 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.660
 put the anti pop filter because if you 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.820
 removes it 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.930
 You can see it on twitter in the photo and if not 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.790
 you will see it later in the text 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.410
 but good especially put because if not 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.600
 it is and it sounds so bad I tried it 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.730
 in fact it sounds a bit more soft 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.770
 with this but good will increase a bit in 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.830
 windows but I 've tried it I've tried it 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 with the filter and without it and without it the p 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 the three of you listen a little bit like that only 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.229
 is that and dies could someone die if 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.030
 is listening to the video with headphones 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.010
 so I prefer to leave it to you for that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.540
 he brings it as I say we do not have the spider 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.820
 that also bring it has placed 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.440
 here to the tripod this we do not have 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 connected but here behind that goes for 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.450
 that so the infinite tablet is there 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 down 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.610
 and it comes here to the normal jack port of 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.320
 Focus camera please, go to the port and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 normal of my laptop in this case 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 well there is audacity there is the house 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.330
 from my neighbor from behind in the reflection and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 well nothing else I think it's not a both 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 zinc as it is open out there 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.850
 but well I've already tried it, you have the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 test now and that you know that from 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.250
 now I'm going to record like this until I get 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.480
 we are this best for the micro but 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.810
 Well I leave you with the test so far 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.730
 there was the good one I'm already 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.610
 it would be the test of the micro here you are 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.030
 listening to the new micro only goes to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.280
 having a filter was going to be the filter of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.510
 noise reduction this audio because 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 I have the fan back there 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.620
 I have it turned on because if 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.890
 I'm not going to die of heat because we're 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.130
 in the Canary Islands and even if it's autumn we're dying 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.420
 of heat to 32 degrees but good I do not have 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.530
 A little bit down, as you saw, I got more 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.470
 or less for the play that but has 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.140
 quite reach the truth and is at 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 command c in the windows control in the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.780
 control panel has great type and has 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.489
 Well, this is the solution but I think it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 listen pretty well as I say I have 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.080
 Apply the noise reduction because 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.960
 I took the fan back there but 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.710
 I think it sounds very 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.190
 and very well so I'm very happy and 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.610
 I hope this test serves to know 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 how will the quality of the videos be 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.130
 now onwards goodbye
