00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
because some of the boxes are small and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.500 
because some of the boxes are small and
I<00:02:19.800> think<00:02:20.070> another<00:02:20.310> cute<00:02:20.730> thing<00:02:20.970> would<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.270> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
I think another cute thing would be is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.720 
I think another cute thing would be is
if<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.900> had<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> different<00:02:22.470> shape<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.550> hole

they<00:04:24.290> have<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.500> bunch<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.890> those<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:26.030> I

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
they have a bunch of those so this one I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.940 
they have a bunch of those so this one I
comes<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:26.930> many<00:04:27.050> colors<00:04:27.200> like<00:04:27.830> black<00:04:29.050> pink<00:04:30.050> no

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
comes in many colors like black pink no

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.970 
comes in many colors like black pink no
not<00:04:31.190> pink<00:04:31.490> red<00:04:31.790> blue<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.330> green<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.620> picked

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
not pink red blue and green so I picked

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.350 
not pink red blue and green so I picked
up<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.250> black<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.820> think<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.180> matches

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
up the black because I think it matches

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.320 
up the black because I think it matches
these<00:04:36.110> colors<00:04:36.590> really<00:04:36.800> nice<00:04:37.100> just<00:04:38.090> like<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
these colors really nice just like the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.010 
these colors really nice just like the
monochromatic<00:04:38.810> tamed<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.780> when<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:41.990> open

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
monochromatic tamed and so when you open

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.560 
monochromatic tamed and so when you open
it<00:04:42.500> it's<00:04:43.070> really<00:04:43.220> colorful<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.210> inside

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
it it's really colorful on the inside

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.220 
it it's really colorful on the inside
especially<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.760> top<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.630> looks<00:04:47.930> and

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
especially on the top of it it looks and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.570 
especially on the top of it it looks and
if<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.620> could<00:04:48.770> see<00:04:48.950> that<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.160> looks<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.430> a

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
if you could see that it looks like a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.670 
if you could see that it looks like a
rainbow<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.930> has<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.500> lot<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:52.300> colors<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.510> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
rainbow so it has a lot of colors in it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.250 
rainbow so it has a lot of colors in it

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
put this in another planner like a

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.899 
put this in another planner like a
Filofax<00:06:47.340> or<00:06:47.879> something<00:06:48.300> make<00:06:49.080> it<00:06:49.229> your<00:06:49.349> own<00:06:49.909> so

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.309 
I think these are perfect because I plan
to<00:06:52.830> make<00:06:53.099> this<00:06:53.639> turn<00:06:54.030> this<00:06:54.330> into<00:06:54.539> a<00:06:54.690> health<00:06:55.110> and

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319

me everything's usually do wednesdays

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.860 
me everything's usually do wednesdays
fridays<00:07:22.169> and<00:07:22.590> sundays<00:07:22.710> so<00:07:23.460> it's<00:07:23.610> not<00:07:23.819> like<00:07:24.120> we

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
fridays and sundays so it's not like we

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.240 
fridays and sundays so it's not like we
don't<00:07:24.960> have<00:07:25.080> enough<00:07:25.199> room<00:07:25.620> and<00:07:25.860> you<00:07:25.949> also<00:07:26.129> have

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
don't have enough room and you also have

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.640 
don't have enough room and you also have
the<00:07:26.490> notes<00:07:26.729> section<00:07:26.879> so<00:07:27.389> you're<00:07:27.629> listed<00:07:28.500> over

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
the notes section so you're listed over

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.800 
the notes section so you're listed over
here<00:07:28.830> and<00:07:29.430> write<00:07:29.610> any<00:07:29.789> details<00:07:30.240> that<00:07:30.479> you<00:07:30.659> need

to<00:07:31.159> so<00:07:32.159> yeah<00:07:32.370> i<00:07:32.400> think<00:07:32.610> these<00:07:32.969> two<00:07:33.240> fit<00:07:33.840> quite

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
to so yeah i think these two fit quite

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.749 
to so yeah i think these two fit quite
well<00:07:34.289> and<00:07:35.240> i'm<00:07:36.240> going<00:07:36.629> to<00:07:36.960> use<00:07:37.110> separate

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 
well and i'm going to use separate

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.520 
well and i'm going to use separate
planners<00:07:38.759> instead<00:07:39.300> of<00:07:39.419> one<00:07:39.629> like<00:07:39.810> big<00:07:40.110> one<00:07:40.349> in

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
planners instead of one like big one in

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.730 
planners instead of one like big one in
like<00:07:40.680> a<00:07:40.710> Filofax<00:07:41.159> or<00:07:41.580> something<00:07:42.000> because<00:07:42.740> i

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
like a Filofax or something because i

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.879 
like a Filofax or something because i
didn't<00:07:44.430> want<00:07:44.460> to<00:07:44.789> add<00:07:45.060> tuna<00:07:45.449> inserts<00:07:46.020> and<00:07:46.380> bulk

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:46.889 
didn't want to add tuna inserts and bulk

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.640 
didn't want to add tuna inserts and bulk
up<00:07:47.099> my<00:07:47.370> planner<00:07:47.960> because<00:07:48.960> there's<00:07:49.259> not<00:07:49.469> much

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:49.650 
up my planner because there's not much

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.209 
up my planner because there's not much
room<00:07:49.889> on<00:07:50.130> it<00:07:50.340> and<00:07:50.580> so<00:07:51.569> these<00:07:51.990> would<00:07:52.529> work<00:07:52.770> quite

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:53.219 
room on it and so these would work quite

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:55.100 
room on it and so these would work quite
nicely<00:07:53.250> and<00:07:53.849> they're<00:07:53.969> pretty<00:07:54.300> small<00:07:54.599> portable

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.110 
nicely and they're pretty small portable

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.740 
nicely and they're pretty small portable

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:57.750
