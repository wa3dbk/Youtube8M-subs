00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello there is a lot of me lately 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.099
 asked to tell about the comparator I decided 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
 do this despite the fact that one 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.240
 you canâ€™t quit again 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 a look at their capabilities externally 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 comparators are very similar to repeaters 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 and in something even similar in behavior 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 the main difference that immediately rushes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 in the eye this is what the comparator is double 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.609
 work press 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.349
 indicator of this torch front end and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.869
 if the torch is drowned then this is the mode 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 comparison if the torch we have raised is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 subtraction mode on modes i will tell 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.840
 a little later and now let's 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.160
 let's see the comparator hold the signal 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 only one way 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 but unlike repeaters they signal 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.520
 do not amplify i.e. signal strength 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 which was at the entrance will and at the exit 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 Comparators also have additional 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.390
 inputs on the sides to the left or right here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.760
 there is an interesting feature if behind 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 the main input can be signal 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 using a torch then on an extra 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 the entrance so the giver gave me succeed only 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 using roadstone 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 let's deal with the modes of operation of the comparator 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 For starters, I hope everyone knows what 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.369
 the signal in redstone extends to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.560
 15 blocks length that is from our 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.580
 torch source signal for but goes to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.470
 15 blocks 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.229
 accordingly if we locate here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.420
 comparator it will also pass on 15 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.520
 blocks let's try to deal with 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.500
 still with the modes the first mode is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 when the comparator just conducts the signal 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 same power as you can see here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 the signal is damped by one block 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 accordingly, we have 14 blocks 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 signal is transmitted now let's 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.409
 look at the comparison mode here I have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 recessed torch is a comparison mode 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.850
 send here an additional signal and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 compare here so here we have signals 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.619
 the power is the same here and here 14 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.189
 blocks respectively the output is the same 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.649
 signal 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.810
 if we give the signal here even less and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 what the output does not change but let's 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.200
 try to signal to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 additional input more than 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 main as can be seen at the output 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 the signal has disappeared that is in compare mode 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.990
 we compare input 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.540
 signals if additional more than 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.340
 the main output will be 0 next 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 subtraction mode in this mode 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 ordinary arithmetic is produced 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 operation in which from the main entrance 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.819
 subtracted signal strength 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.989
 additional 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.389
 let's say 14 minus 14 will give zero minus 13 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.340
 signal power unit and so on 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.019
 of course if we will deduct from 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.310
 smaller signal more we will have 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.590
 still 0 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.599
 what else can comparators give us 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.459
 comparators can quantify 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.680
 items of any container 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.900
 For example, distributors are more precise than even 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120
 quantity and percentage 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.639
 here I have an empty distribution comparator and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.069
 line is 15 blocks long let's put 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.159
 our distributor is one thing and how can 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.319
 see we do nothing with what 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.230
 this is due i honestly say no 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.329
 I can because something probably 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.859
 let's try putting one more here 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.689
 subject though it is very strange 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.699
 the comparator was supposed to work 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.159
 so ok let's try to put 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:02.069
 I have several items here 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.099
 yes it looks like some kind of bug I found in 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.889
 filming time and comparator yes apparently this 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.290
 the flight bug is just as you can see stuck 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.599
 so probably it makes sense to write 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.299
 mahjong so they fixed this bug 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.370
 so back to our lesson and if we 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.650
 place the items here let's say three 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 subjects not trying every not 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.729
 trying object is perceived as 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.919
 full stock you can see that we have 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.400
 signal to one-third power i.e. five 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.560
 blocks 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.239
 accordingly it allows us 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.009
 determine the occupancy of any 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.500
 container as well as using this 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.299
 abilities can be determined by us 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.949
 items in the cart mage rare 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.019
 need to be containers then 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.280
 have it a trolley with operas or 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.290
 trolleys with chests 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.239
 let's put a cooper cart on 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.099
 push rails next to push 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.930
 rails we have is a comparator, and 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.939
 put a cart any item 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.989
 as you can see on the output appeared 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.239
 weak signal 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.489
 if we put here not staying 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.709
 the item that is filled in the fifth part 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.989
 we get a fifth of our truck at home 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.150
 signal three blocks long course 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.040
 the comparator must stand directly 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.169
 before push rails if we 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.840
 put it below and put it here 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.329
 the trolley will then take the signal places 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.609
 our earth rails and signal presence 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.620
 trolleys on push flights that is it 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.389
 there will be a signal of full power and 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.769
 last interesting enough function 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.930
 that's what the comparator is 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.030
 it is to update the blocks in front of itself that is 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.250
 block in front of two blocks on the edges 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.360
 let's post here a red torch by 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.129
 we put the distributor 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.349
 and how can you hear from our sound 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.889
 distributions began to work and work 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.900
 he will 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.729
 and set at the edges respectively 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.830
 if you remove the comparator the distributor 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.690
 work stops in this way 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.300
 comparator allows us to produce 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.879
 fast update of blocks in front of you 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.919
 it is also possible to use here such 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.960
 The basic functions of comparators I hope 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.360
 that everything was clear to you if you 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.130
 Still , something is not clear then of course 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.319
 write in the comments just do not 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.270
 forget to leave your marks well and 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.610
 of course subscribe to channel a 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.270
 Today on this all until next meetings 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.270
 until
