00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
across and then just walk up the other
side<00:02:11.690> now<00:02:12.690> compare<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:14.480> sloping<00:02:15.480> bank<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
side now compare this sloping bank to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.949 
side now compare this sloping bank to
the<00:02:15.900> other<00:02:16.140> one<00:02:16.349> let's<00:02:16.769> turn<00:02:17.010> around<00:02:17.040> here

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
the other one let's turn around here

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:27.440 
the other one let's turn around here
show<00:02:18.959> y'all<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> we've<00:02:25.950> got<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.459> steep<00:02:27.180> bank

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
show y'all so we've got a steep bank

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.410 
show y'all so we've got a steep bank
there<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:29.489> deer<00:02:29.700> would<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> go<00:02:30.209> down

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
there that deer would have to go down

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.500 
there that deer would have to go down
and<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:31.709> fight<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.329> other<00:02:33.360> side

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and then fight to go up the other side

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.199 
and then fight to go up the other side
or<00:02:34.849> they<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:36.000> walk<00:02:36.180> 30<00:02:36.930> feet<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:38.209> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
or they can walk 30 feet down here and

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.420 
or they can walk 30 feet down here and
walk<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.660> gradual<00:02:40.140> sloping<00:02:40.560> bank<00:02:40.829> that's<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
walk up a gradual sloping bank that's a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.089 
walk up a gradual sloping bank that's a
lot<00:02:41.579> easier<00:02:42.019> so<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:43.829> want<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
lot easier so this is what we want to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.009 
lot easier so this is what we want to
look<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.519> how's<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.540> where<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> deer

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
look for how's this is where the deer

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.110 
look for how's this is where the deer
are<00:02:46.049> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.319> crossing<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.819> we<00:02:47.910> want

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
are going to be crossing at then we want

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.000 
are going to be crossing at then we want
to<00:02:48.180> look<00:02:48.269> for<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:49.609> patch<00:02:50.609> of<00:02:50.640> oak<00:02:51.060> trees

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
to look for a patch of oak trees
