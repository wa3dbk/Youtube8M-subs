00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.790 
small that's just the way I am you're
small<00:03:45.400> that's<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:46.240> who<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.600> are<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:47.530> you

could move fast I can't
I<00:03:50.410> am<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.010> hypothesis<00:03:51.790> about<00:03:51.940> Arnie<00:03:52.450> being

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
I am the hypothesis about Arnie being

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.740 
I am the hypothesis about Arnie being
that<00:03:53.410> big<00:03:53.650> means<00:03:53.950> Arnie<00:03:54.370> always<00:03:55.060> needs<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.570> eat

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
that big means Arnie always needs to eat

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.710 
that big means Arnie always needs to eat
a<00:03:55.780> lot<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.410> he<00:03:56.710> can<00:03:56.860> move<00:03:56.980> his<00:03:57.040> body<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:58.180> know<00:03:58.420> I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
a lot so he can move his body you know I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.440 
a lot so he can move his body you know I
think<00:03:59.290> you're<00:03:59.860> right<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.730> don't<00:04:00.790> eat<00:04:01.150> I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
think you're right but I don't eat I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.350 
think you're right but I don't eat I
could<00:04:01.840> hardly<00:04:02.320> move<00:04:02.620> at<00:04:02.860> all<00:04:03.070> that's<00:04:03.940> really

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
could hardly move at all that's really

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.420 
could hardly move at all that's really
