00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I'm obviously delighted with the three

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.460 
I'm obviously delighted with the three
points<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.140> send<00:02:21.380> them

up<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.830> don't<00:02:22.459> think<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:22.880> played<00:02:23.270> well

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
up I don't think we actually played well

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.060 
up I don't think we actually played well
enough<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.810> win<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.020> game<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.739> we<00:02:24.860> certainly

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
enough to win the game but we certainly

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.130 
enough to win the game but we certainly
another<00:02:25.340> chances<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.820> win<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> match<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
another chances to win the match and I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.070 
another chances to win the match and I
thought<00:02:28.040> maybe<00:02:28.340> slow<00:02:28.700> go<00:02:28.880> go<00:02:29.450> past<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.900> bar

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
thought maybe slow go go past the bar

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.860 
thought maybe slow go go past the bar
better<00:02:30.320> than<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.560> did<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.630> know<00:02:32.750> we

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
better than we did and you know we

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.180 
better than we did and you know we
