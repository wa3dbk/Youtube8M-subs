00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.570
 they did not sing big and small and it's that the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.980
 Hope to see your team succeed 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.250
 in front of the current world champion 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.189
 Spain lived to the surface of the skin in

 Embassy of Chile in Lima 10 Chileans 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 to be hard but 10 years is played the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 life and us 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.750
 started the match and with him the faces 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 of anxiety concern and hope in 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 every one of the Chilean fans 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.810
 they ate the nails of the nerves 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 while others trembled with each 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.300
 Spanish play 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 suddenly a sudden attack culminated in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.329
 the first Chilean goal by Eduardo 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.329
 vargas 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.290
 the goal of charles arÃ¡nguiz unleashed the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.290
 madness among the Chilean fans 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 minutes the truth that what has most 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.220
 liked this game leaves me with the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.909
 want to keep screaming but already what 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.909
 I have down 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.439
 I did not imagine a 2 to 0 with Spain but 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.079
 we still lack a time that by 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.820
 play there the rival is complex that lives 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.920
 Peru to Chile are two countries that 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.450
 they deserve all the best point started the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.700
 second time the Chilean fans 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.700
 they lived every second of the game 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.080
 after 45 minutes in more flowers 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.110
 finally the chile took the match 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.110
 I got fed up on board at the embassy 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.610
 20 Chile played incredibly well
