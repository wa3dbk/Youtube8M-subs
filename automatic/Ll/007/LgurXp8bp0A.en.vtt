inspired by ali-a he used to be trailer
breakdowns<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.819> inspired<00:02:11.970> by<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
breakdowns and I was so inspired by that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
breakdowns and I was so inspired by that
I<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:13.050> enjoyed<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> content<00:02:13.860> he<00:02:14.130> produced

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I really enjoyed the content he produced

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.699 
I really enjoyed the content he produced
I<00:02:14.760> don't<00:02:15.060> want<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.569> myself<00:02:15.720> now

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
I don't want to do it for myself now

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.070 
I don't want to do it for myself now
back<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.489> started<00:02:17.540> trailer<00:02:18.540> breakdowns

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
back when I started trailer breakdowns

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.259 
back when I started trailer breakdowns
and<00:02:19.349> information<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.190> new<00:02:20.580> map<00:02:20.790> packs<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
and information on new map packs and

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.120 
and information on new map packs and
things<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:22.019> weren't<00:02:22.410> around<00:02:22.709> no<00:02:22.980> one

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
things really weren't around no one

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.410 
things really weren't around no one
really<00:02:23.340> seemed<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.580> do<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.060> unit

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
really seemed to do on this unit

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.089 
really seemed to do on this unit
obviously<00:02:24.840> those<00:02:24.959> people<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.319> did<00:02:25.560> them<00:02:25.680> but

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
obviously those people that did them but

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.680 
obviously those people that did them but
the<00:02:26.190> amount<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.519> people<00:02:26.580> was<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> very

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the amount of people was not a very

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
the amount of people was not a very
large<00:02:28.170> number<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.799> that<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.069> pretty<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.430> why

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
large number so that is pretty much why

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
large number so that is pretty much why
I<00:02:29.940> started<00:02:30.390> doing<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.049> saw<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> gap

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I started doing it because I saw a gap

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.140 
I started doing it because I saw a gap
in<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> market<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.610> thought<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.120> know

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
