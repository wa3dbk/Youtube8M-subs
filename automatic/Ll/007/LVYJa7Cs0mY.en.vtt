00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello friends with you the same 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 and today there will be an overview of everyone's favorite and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.530
 popular dust2 cards from the game 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.039
 counter-strike global offencive 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.920
 enjoy your viewing time 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 look at this card they give 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.730
 run and look at it so well 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.090
 perhaps the first thing that strikes me 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.809
 this added a lot of unnecessary items on 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.880
 This card is all garbage and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.000
 map specifically remade if you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.520
 remember games like strike 1 6 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 counter pointed laser and counter 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 strike source 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.110
 there was a map as well, sand sand 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.600
 such a god will give than in this game here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 such we now have a large ancient city 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.620
 also these more become frozen 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.620
 that is, you can not now their length 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 because of these items here u have added 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.930
 Shelves map made much darker than 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.890
 source and harder to notice their 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.350
 players well who play with you in the team and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.130
 it's also hard to notice your players 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.630
 rivals ie rival team 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.630
 let's see this map 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.360
 also removed a lot of bugs from this card and 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.240
 secrets but nevertheless they still 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.049
 all their brothers were able to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.049
 developers. 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.810
 we are probably the first secret they are today 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.560
 the fact that you can climb a thousand 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.900
 double drawers on the pate b I think this 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.900
 you all know this secret is not removed 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.519
 following my hard climb on these here 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.819
 shelves 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:41.760
 Jews watch videos of the departing center i 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.640
 I don't understand why I came here 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.040
 car and the sixth afterburner if you look 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:56.280
 everybody stands in the afterburner 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:58.560
 such a car right at the beginning was also 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.549
 you can climb fast 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.049
 zigzag for this jump into the corner so on 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:10.129
 I naturally like nothing 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.129
 it turns out so very bad 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:23.920
 yes what is try neatly 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.600
 turned out we need to jump corner like 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.380
 I understood and so you quickly 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.900
 zalest able to zigzag so this 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:38.980
 I can't climb a thing 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.610
 On effect now try for flattering si 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.530
 crates 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.320
 as you remember in source and you can 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.400
 It was to climb and now in the course of this 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.340
 you can not do if I was running live 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.650
 on this map I would naturally on them 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.500
 created could try from the barrel so from 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.370
 the barrels I climbed to the dacha nothing seems to me 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.370
 will not work 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.870
 yes now I can not climb 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.760
 okay any secrets i'm 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.290
 I will find and be sure to show you in 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.530
 upcoming releases yes cards of course 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.580
 beautiful on a five-point scale I and 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.580
 put a solid top five 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:34.690
 also you can climb this box 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:37.260
 I beat the carpet on the same wall 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.260
 hanging room 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.110
 as you remember in the sauce and the stone was 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.080
 much more is now made him sit down 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.639
 noticeably lower she is using a landing player 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.639
 you can also climb this container 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.449
 such here somehow 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.660
 now we have 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.720
 pillars such as right in ancient Greece 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.270
 when the games were held there by all 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.870
 famous who know who stories 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.730
 passed at least such here 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.650
 us now the map in the game counter strike 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:46.840
 global offencive also changed the boxes to 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.570
 used them now also smeared with you not 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.760
 can we fight 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:06:03.040
 head off air oddly enough well and 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:06.480
 fix the musa sag why along the way 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.480
 the developers were dirty 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:23.250
 more rubbish yes how much rubbish is there 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:27.060
 ponadavit it and see among all 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:32.940
 here this city among this gloom 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:38.720
 I see a bush that remains alone which 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.720
 grows through concrete and without water 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.570
 adapt to any conditions it is 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.570
