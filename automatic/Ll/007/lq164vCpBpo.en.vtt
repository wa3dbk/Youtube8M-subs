00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello and welcome to compass combo 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.060
 I am skalli and I thank you for 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.440
 watch my videos video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.150
 today will speak to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
 beginners those who have all the material 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.289
 who is just starting to make sternum 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.260
 and who want to know by which figure 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.820
 started then if you already have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.420
 some basics and all that is good you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.949
 can start 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 but if you do not have the basics yet 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.259
 like to move tour stop all 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.660
 I invite you to go to the sites 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.429
 roller-blade classes as on which 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.259
 I sell a DVD to learn the basics 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.350
 from inline in the end you have 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.940
 still the initiation in slalom 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 but there will still be more videos 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.219
 on compass combo so here you have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.199
 the material you're motivated evolved to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.789
 know by which figure started then 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.829
 there is choice first you can that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.210
 pass on compass combo dot com and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.260
 follow the list of figures by levels 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.690
 to know that the level is really 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.969
 subjective is really to give a 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.199
 pattern archi of figures even though we can 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.239
 very well start with the figures the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.309
 more difficult without necessarily passing 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.250
 by the basic figures 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.140
 those moments not a problem so I 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 chose five figures that for me 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 allow you to start without too much 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 difficulties in slalom 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.400
 we could choose another seven five 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 other figures if we had gone in a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 competition goal or five others 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 figures if he was really in a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.619
 objective a little more playful 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 this is a compromise between started on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.049
 slalom but both technical and at the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.049
 time in leisure so the first figure 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.210
 that I chose is the cross before 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.780
 shown walking forward on two feet 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.530
 with the looks on the studs and a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 double support 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 so this is the easiest figure I 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.540
 does not count against what 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.009
 Looks like the easier it is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.719
 scull it up game not because for 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.460
 well do it the center of 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.740
 gravity stays above the studs and that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.000
 the feet go to the right and to the left 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.170
 so for all the videos the figures 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 that I will quote 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.899
 they will be available just in from 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.789
 the description of the video below 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.409
 so first figure crossed before we got 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.270
 legs bent one tries to weight 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.030
 of the body on the heels one crosses the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.829
 feet uncrossed here I advise to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.509
 start with a gap of about 1 m 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.700
 20 meters 50 between studs 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.409
 and gradually tightened when we 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.430
 managed to make this first figure on 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.840
 can move on to the next 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.720
 but we can also move on to the next 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 before that so cross before for the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.989
 first second figure for in 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.970
 surprise a few i would say that 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.599
 it's the nelson back it's not 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.709
 necessarily the easiest one appearance 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.680
 could take weeks and 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.299
 snakes and all that but the most useful 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.609
 in any case after crossing it before this 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.900
 will be the back nelson it's a figure 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.980
 which is affordable because it does not 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.769
 not a lot of speed 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.390
 from the stop and we have a field of 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.420
 vision which is a little on the side that has 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.400
 Lateral hacked unlike the Crusaders 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.720
 back which will be later where we are 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.129
 obliged to really look behind the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.349
 nelson back we can look at the 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.819
 side then the difficulty of the nelson 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 back is we start with a 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.599
 daigle movement so he asks a little 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.670
 flexibility and then we move on a 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.519
 crossed back he asked for no 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.560
 flexibility but just supports 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.739
 the interest is nelson back 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.720
 who's going to ask the skaters 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.549
 to lighten a foot to be able to turn 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.049
 the other one that's really very important 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.569
 at the beginning to start having a 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.819
 transfer of the weight of both legs on 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.560
 a single leg to lighten a foot and 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.299
 their lorientais differently 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 besides, as soon as you see a foot 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.389
 that change direction that means 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.730
 that the weight of the body that were on that 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.620
 foot was removed to put on the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.389
 foot so youth in the back we have them 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.760
 crossing feet passing eagle 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.329
 who has the right foot for example is going 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.190
 alternate back forward back 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.169
 then we'll go to the nelson before 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 so I took it I preferred to start 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.949
 by the employee at number two and the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.299
 nelson before at number 3 because at 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.180
 level of flexibility the dwarf before 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.019
 request more hip opening is 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.090
 a little more difficult 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.319
 so if you get to do nelson 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.569
 back what is more logical in 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.889
 general the nelson before a little 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.730
 several will be more affordable 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:03.250
 after that we crossed before nelson 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.889
 back nelson before stealing always 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.159
 in figures where we have both supports 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.299
 at the beginning then a support which lighten 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.120
 and there to the frames in fourth position 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.590
 we go back to the crusaders that's where 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.260
 we started to have a better 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.599
 balance thanks to the nelson and here we have a 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.139
 position that ask to open more 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.789
 in the back we block heaps 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.379
 are we opening the poles to be able to 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.780
 look behind you 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.889
 do not look by 2 over the shoulder 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.629
 do not look between your legs 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.360
 it's really an opening of the poles 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:34.490
 and chest to be able to see all 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.050
 the plans that passed and cross it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.039
 back the body weight lie 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.020
 on tiptoes 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.370
 when we cross before we were more 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.229
 on the heels slightly more on the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.529
 heels back we are on the tip 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.419
 feet 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.430
 so I start I already advise of 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.180
 to know how to roll backwards as in the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.469
 dvd then shifted a little feet and 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.939
 then started doing crusaders in 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.229
 outside the lawns and once we 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.169
 is able to do that we try in 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.770
 the studs we start with four studs 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.150
 spread apart crossed spreads are here we 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.909
 cross back it comes pretty quickly 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.800
 if we keep the right bust in one sitting 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.990
 where in a few sessions depending on the level 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.150
 that you will have and finally the last 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.279
 figure to start this would be one 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.219
 front foot so we went from both 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:19.699
 support alternate support then a 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.740
 opening two goals to one support 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.249
 ground so on before a walk 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.379
 while walking 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.389
 this is the fifth figure that I propose 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.620
 which demands an even greater balance 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.500
 extreme in relation to the president to 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.089
 previous figures that so that for the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.800
 to take her foot forward but I 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.509
 advise the same outside the studs 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.610
 to try to keep as much as possible in 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.509
 putting the center of gravity above 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.279
 from the most important foot to the ground and in 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.469
 trying to stand a long time next to 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.449
 studs if you are able to hold the 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.639
 length of wines plo next on one foot 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.409
 there you can start doing four 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.560
 or five slalom shots always 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.529
 taller spaced 80 cm so here 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.279
 I recap crossheads before nelson 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.259
 rear nelson front three backs and 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:05.180
 a stone walking forward with its five 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:09.159
 figures you already have a good base 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.509
 to understand the beginnings in slalom 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.279
 knowing that I also advise you to 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.550
 work the right foot and the bad 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.379
 foot 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.610
 it means to cross before right foot 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.770
 front but crossing left foot 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.729
 in front of you are changing once again 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.689
 from time to time you put your foot 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.460
 right once in a while you 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.779
 put left foot is the umpteenth 5 that's 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.580
 the same you look right once 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.659
 and sometimes you look to the left is 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.110
 for him a foot is even more 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.490
 difficult 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.160
 you have to try once the right foot 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.150
 once the left foot 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.650
 if we want to be versatile 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.750
 important to know how to do all this if we 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.000
 wants to go fast and know how to do the most 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.890
 possible figures not taking care of 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.910
 of the right foot of the left foot a rat in 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.220
 this case you can do everything the same 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.250
 foot but I advise against it needs 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.360
 still crazy anyway trying to be 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.040
 unbalanced muscle work for 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.750
 not that they get tired too quickly and 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.940
 same time to be of being versatile for 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.200
 to have more figures in the end than the 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.390
 driver on the right or side side 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.250
 left so I tried to make a 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.620
 pretty short video I hope you 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.760
 will have learned enough for those who
