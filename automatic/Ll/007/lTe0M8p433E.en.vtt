a<00:03:29.470> lot<00:03:29.740> of<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.490> nothing<00:03:31.300> special

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
a lot of you know that nothing special

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.460 
a lot of you know that nothing special
and<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.770> tried<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.250> use<00:03:33.430> notes<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.840> little

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:49.949 
and I tried to use notes of this little
run<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.240> try<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:37.470> playfully

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.080 

so<00:03:50.959> now<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.170> see<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.220> last<00:03:52.370> one<00:03:52.640> was<00:03:52.849> not

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.500 
so now you see that the last one was not
okay<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.659> have<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.470> try<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:55.760> stay<00:03:56.090> in<00:03:56.360> the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:31.439 
the same thing let's say with the next
Pentatonix<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.709> second<00:04:13.069> run<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.610> year

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:43.500 

okay<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.320> use<00:04:40.840> maybe<00:04:41.840> these<00:04:42.110> four<00:04:42.530> notes

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
okay so I use maybe these four notes

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.700 
okay so I use maybe these four notes
sometimes<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.630> changed<00:04:45.020> my<00:04:45.169> mind<00:04:45.350> while

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
sometimes I changed my mind while

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.520 
sometimes I changed my mind while
playing<00:04:45.949> but<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:47.479> doesn't<00:04:47.780> matter<00:04:47.930> as<00:04:48.169> long<00:04:48.199> as

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
playing but it doesn't matter as long as

00:04:48.530 --> 00:05:03.780 
playing but it doesn't matter as long as
you<00:04:49.010> stay<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.280> groove

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.420 

see<00:05:04.790> now<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.360> used<00:05:07.750> chromatic<00:05:08.750> rundown<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:10.250> can

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
see now I used chromatic rundown you can

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.320 
see now I used chromatic rundown you can
do<00:05:10.690> all<00:05:11.690> these<00:05:12.050> things<00:05:12.730> next<00:05:13.730> one<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
do all these things next one is the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:50.350 
do all these things next one is the
fourth<00:05:48.700> so<00:05:49.700> you<00:05:49.760> can

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
fourth so you can

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.790 
fourth so you can
well<00:05:50.960> maybe<00:05:51.580> use<00:05:52.580> some<00:05:53.060> notes<00:05:53.960> that<00:05:54.200> you

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
well maybe use some notes that you

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.800 
well maybe use some notes that you
prepare<00:05:55.430> before<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.940> say<00:05:56.090> well<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:56.480> want<00:05:56.750> to

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
prepare before and say well I want to

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.150 
prepare before and say well I want to
use<00:05:57.110> let's<00:05:57.470> say<00:05:58.780> these<00:05:59.780> five<00:06:00.140> notes<00:06:00.350> and<00:06:01.010> then

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
use let's say these five notes and then

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:09.400 
use let's say these five notes and then
first<00:06:01.550> maybe<00:06:01.760> you<00:06:01.940> try<00:06:02.210> as<00:06:02.510> a<00:06:02.570> beginner<00:06:08.410> with

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
first maybe you try as a beginner with

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.880 
first maybe you try as a beginner with
that<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.390> more<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:11.990> more<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.500> start<00:06:12.770> to

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
that and that more and more you start to

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:24.909 
that and that more and more you start to
improve<00:06:13.340> things

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.600 

this<00:06:25.919> is<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.189> way<00:06:26.399> that<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:26.729> mean<00:06:27.119> you<00:06:27.449> you<00:06:28.259> can

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
this is the way that I mean you you can

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.399 
this is the way that I mean you you can
improve<00:06:29.869> using<00:06:30.869> these<00:06:31.050> Kings<00:06:31.409> and<00:06:32.119> you<00:06:33.119> can

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
improve using these Kings and you can

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.739 
improve using these Kings and you can
have<00:06:34.409> more<00:06:34.649> fun<00:06:34.710> playing<00:06:35.309> yeah<00:06:35.909> because<00:06:36.360> you

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:36.749 
have more fun playing yeah because you

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.389 
have more fun playing yeah because you
play<00:06:36.990> music<00:06:37.379> all<00:06:37.529> the<00:06:37.649> time<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:38.069> have<00:06:38.249> to

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
play music all the time you have to

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:42.730 
play music all the time you have to
think<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:39.059> to<00:06:39.539> find<00:06:39.839> out<00:06:40.490> what<00:06:41.490> is<00:06:41.729> fun<00:06:42.210> and

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
for me it is fun to play things like

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.329 
for me it is fun to play things like
that<00:06:45.539> for<00:06:45.809> if<00:06:46.259> I<00:06:46.439> had<00:06:46.589> the<00:06:46.740> time<00:06:46.919> I<00:06:46.979> would<00:06:47.069> play

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:55.589 
something like that you can strum the

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:00.219 
something like that you can strum the
notes<00:06:55.889> but<00:06:56.279> I<00:06:56.520> lately<00:06:57.479> have<00:06:57.839> started<00:06:58.529> to<00:06:58.740> use

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
notes but I lately have started to use

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.929 
notes but I lately have started to use
the<00:07:01.229> other<00:07:01.409> fingers<00:07:01.889> of<00:07:02.009> my<00:07:02.039> right<00:07:02.189> hand<00:07:02.699> and

together with a plaque yeah it sounds a

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:11.779 
together with a plaque yeah it sounds a
little<00:07:06.180> bit<00:07:06.360> cleaner<00:07:06.629> to<00:07:07.139> me<00:07:10.249> you<00:07:11.249> see<00:07:11.490> I<00:07:11.520> use

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
little bit cleaner to me you see I use

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.980 
little bit cleaner to me you see I use
my<00:07:12.029> middle<00:07:12.180> finger<00:07:12.539> and<00:07:12.719> ring<00:07:12.899> finger<00:07:14.779> to<00:07:15.779> get

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
my middle finger and ring finger to get

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:48.850 
my middle finger and ring finger to get
the<00:07:16.110> melody<00:07:16.379> on<00:07:16.949> the<00:07:17.039> B<00:07:17.610> string

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.560 

is<00:07:49.860> it<00:07:50.010> these<00:07:50.340> licks<00:07:50.730> are<00:07:50.910> interesting<00:07:51.390> when

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
is it these licks are interesting when

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.130 
is it these licks are interesting when
you<00:07:51.750> use<00:07:51.960> the<00:07:52.140> plaque<00:07:52.350> and<00:07:52.560> the<00:07:52.710> middle<00:07:52.920> finger
