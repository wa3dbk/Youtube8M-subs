00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
that yeah we added an edge to it just to

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.969 
that yeah we added an edge to it just to
keep<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:05.059> basically<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.170> extra<00:01:06.440> soil<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979

to six inches so you can just have to
saw<00:01:11.479> all<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.780> plants<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:12.260> there<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
saw all the plants in there and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.260 
saw all the plants in there and
everything<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:13.070> check<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.030> giant

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270

raised bed on top of a roof giant raised
bed<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:16.460> top<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.880> roof<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.329> did<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.899> have

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
bed on top of the roof now did you have

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.469 
bed on top of the roof now did you have
to<00:01:18.140> have<00:01:18.229> any<00:01:18.409> structural<00:01:19.090> checking<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.210> an

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
to have any structural checking out an

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.719 
to have any structural checking out an
engineer<00:01:20.869> come<00:01:21.049> in<00:01:21.200> yeah<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.250> definitely

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
engineer come in yeah it's a definitely

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.190 
engineer come in yeah it's a definitely
good<00:01:22.880> idea<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.390> someone<00:01:23.659> come<00:01:23.869> out<00:01:24.020> there

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
good idea to have someone come out there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.080 
good idea to have someone come out there
certified<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.920> can<00:01:25.130> go<00:01:25.250> out<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.430> test<00:01:25.729> you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
certified that can go out and test you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.670 
certified that can go out and test you
know<00:01:26.149> test<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> weight<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.200> roof<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> see

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
know test the weight of the roof and see

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.099 
know test the weight of the roof and see
how<00:01:27.799> much<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.189> go<00:01:28.369> there's<00:01:28.969> not<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.600> much

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
how much it can go there's not that much

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.870 
how much it can go there's not that much
stuff<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.619> top<00:01:30.829> but<00:01:31.039> definitely<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:31.579> larger

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
stuff on top but definitely for larger

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.980 
stuff on top but definitely for larger
structures<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.390> want<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.659> sure<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.899> get

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
structures you want to be sure you get

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.359 
structures you want to be sure you get
that<00:01:33.049> covered<00:01:33.500> all<00:01:33.770> right<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.039> then<00:01:34.130> how<00:01:34.310> did

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
that covered all right and then how did

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.800 
that covered all right and then how did
you<00:01:34.520> choose<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.909> plants<00:01:35.359> I<00:01:35.450> see<00:01:35.600> your<00:01:35.719> head

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
you choose the plants I see your head

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.120 
you choose the plants I see your head
like<00:01:35.930> see<00:01:36.200> domes<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.590> there's<00:01:36.770> some<00:01:36.920> grasses

blood sedum which we thought with the
Angelina<00:01:53.390> see<00:01:53.659> them<00:01:53.810> would<00:01:53.960> make<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:54.350> such<00:01:54.409> a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
Angelina see them would make just such a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.590 
Angelina see them would make just such a
cool<00:01:54.799> contract<00:01:55.399> beautiful<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.149> know<00:01:56.179> color

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
cool contract beautiful you know color

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.840 
cool contract beautiful you know color
different<00:01:57.109> foliage<00:01:57.289> textures<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.310> nice

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
different foliage textures and the nice

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.340 
different foliage textures and the nice
thing<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.299> every<00:01:59.539> one<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.780> these<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.079> very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
thing is is every one of these is very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.370 
thing is is every one of these is very
very<00:02:00.920> drought<00:02:01.219> tolerant<00:02:01.249> so<00:02:02.079> we<00:02:03.079> let<00:02:03.259> mother

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
very drought tolerant so we let mother

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.450 
very drought tolerant so we let mother
nature<00:02:03.590> water<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.189> springtime

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
nature water in the springtime

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
summertime comes around we let them fend

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.040 
summertime comes around we let them fend
for<00:02:07.579> themselves<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:08.899> low

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
for themselves and so it's low

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.300 
for themselves and so it's low
maintenance<00:02:09.080> which<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.800> great<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.250> don't

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
summertime and one of the concepts for

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
summertime and one of the concepts for
the<00:02:26.010> Eco<00:02:26.220> roof<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> help<00:02:26.790> keep<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.210> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the Eco roof is to help keep the the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.690 
the Eco roof is to help keep the the
temperature<00:02:27.990> down<00:02:28.140> underneath<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:29.400> well<00:02:29.430> as

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
temperature down underneath as well as

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
temperature down underneath as well as
acting<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.060> an<00:02:30.180> insulation<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.990> helps

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
acting as an insulation it just helps

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
acting as an insulation it just helps
kind<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.530> reflect<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> Sun<00:02:32.550> glare<00:02:32.880> off<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
kind of reflect the Sun glare off and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.470 
kind of reflect the Sun glare off and
keep<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> lot<00:02:34.740> cooler<00:02:34.980> inside<00:02:35.310> hopefully<00:02:35.760> so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
keep it a lot cooler inside hopefully so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.030 
keep it a lot cooler inside hopefully so
I<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.660> we've<00:02:36.900> been<00:02:36.960> hearing<00:02:37.290> about<00:02:37.530> these
