00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
 how good 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.309
 We present a series of products this 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 year for windows 8 your environment thought 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.639
 especially for a tactile environment by 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.050
 both a mouse will convince many times 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 maybe we have a little bit left 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 to be able to leave all the potential that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 currently has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.009
 logitech will allow us to be able to do this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 mass more than you could have an environment 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.279
 tactile 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.490
 to be able to handle 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.869
 others already exist in the market but 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.679
 pay attention interested for windows 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.879
 8 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.290
 a mouse like the one we have so far 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.100
 that is here that allows us to be able 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.199
 drive 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 apart from the conventional 40 as a touch 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.739
 and a slightly cheaper option is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 be this here that although it seems to be 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.979
 a conventional mouse is not, since the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.960
 wheel button replaced by a scroll 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.900
 touch that will also allow power 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 handle the windows environment in this case 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.409
 for example we can do to be a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.970
 multi touch lathe can we do from 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.460
 for example with a single finger change the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.650
 application can access the menus of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.150
 side windows or even against those 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.120
 that can make you minimize windows 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.580
 maximize windows 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 other environments we can access what 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.380
 would be the tone of worlds directly 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.619
 doing that is all simply with the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.619
 the rest 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.770
 an infinity has a switch that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.720
 allows you to turn it on and off 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.760
 led indicating for example the status of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.120
 the gothic batteries without battery you 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.580
 invite indicates and it turns red 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.200
 via a microUSB cable us 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.010
 allows to connect it to the great 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.810
 advantage that we have with logitech 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.830
 lately it's that instead of doing what 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.200
 what we did until now is a 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.600
 charger or batteries if you run out 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.220
 you can connect it directly 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 to your computer and then the barricade 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.190
 where humble you can go using the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.230
 device is configurable ie 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.180
 all touch both the 60 functions 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.190
 of posture as you want by default 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.190
 come standard brings some interface 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.000
 this environment of logitech phases point 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.460
 and it allows us to be able to handle it all 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 devices even what we were commenting on 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.490
 in the tutorial in which he explains how 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490
 we handle everything 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.390
 and everything pour configurable change it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.100
 Very very friendly environment opposite 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.100
 especially for windows 8
