pretty darn cool I'll admit at first I
was<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.280> unsure<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.629> work

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
was a little unsure how these would work

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.529 
was a little unsure how these would work
but<00:00:58.109> these<00:00:58.320> work<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.859> pretty<00:00:59.250> great<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> they

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
but these work out pretty great and they

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.810 
but these work out pretty great and they

the passive radar for being locked on

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
the passive radar for being locked on
but<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> description<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> passive

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
but as a description of the passive

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.080 
but as a description of the passive
radar<00:01:56.909> says<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.619> locked<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
radar says if you are locked on you you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
radar says if you are locked on you you
lose<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> lock<00:02:00.840> after<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> fire<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> missile

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
lose the lock after you fire the missile

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.330 
lose the lock after you fire the missile
and<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.850> reacquire<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.450> lock<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.500> still<00:02:04.829> can

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and you reacquire the lock you still can

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.540 
and you reacquire the lock you still can
end<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:06.570> killing<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> enemy<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:08.250> less<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
end up killing the enemy there's less of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
end up killing the enemy there's less of
a<00:02:08.759> chance<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.110> still<00:02:10.349> can't<00:02:10.619> kill

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
a chance of it but you still can't kill

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.300 
a chance of it but you still can't kill
the<00:02:11.039> enemy

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the enemy

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.530 
the enemy
also<00:02:13.310> talked<00:02:13.550> about<00:02:13.790> right<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.270> you'll<00:02:14.450> see

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
also talked about right here you'll see

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.690 
also talked about right here you'll see
one<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> downfalls<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.280> passive

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
one of the downfalls of the passive

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.960 
one of the downfalls of the passive
radar<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.530> lose<00:02:18.890> your<00:02:19.130> Zuni<00:02:19.490> rockets

which I have equipped specifically to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.830

make this an anti-air vehicle you know I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800 
make this an anti-air vehicle you know I
get<00:02:33.140> close<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.220> almost<00:02:35.120> take<00:02:35.450> them<00:02:35.630> out

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
but you know what he just has a little

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.360 
but you know what he just has a little
bit<00:02:38.180> more<00:02:38.300> firepower<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.590> I'm<00:02:39.770> using<00:02:40.070> a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
bit more firepower because I'm using a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.970 
bit more firepower because I'm using a

keep<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.510> lock<00:04:20.780> centered<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.440> they<00:04:22.099> will

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
keep that lock centered and they will

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.880 
keep that lock centered and they will
hit<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> enemy<00:04:23.030> they<00:04:23.930> do<00:04:24.020> do<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.320> lot<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.590> damage

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
hit the enemy they do do a lot of damage

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
hit the enemy they do do a lot of damage
I<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:25.250> there

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
I think there

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.930 
I think there
cool<00:04:26.300> seven<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:27.710> probably<00:04:28.070> won't<00:04:28.250> be<00:04:28.310> my<00:04:28.580> main

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
cool seven it probably won't be my main

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.410 
cool seven it probably won't be my main
setup<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.020> boat<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.760> think<00:04:31.910> I'm<00:04:32.240> in

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
setup for the boat but if I think I'm in

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.320 
setup for the boat but if I think I'm in
a<00:04:32.450> bath<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.560> think<00:04:34.160> my<00:04:34.310> team<00:04:34.550> needs<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.090> take

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
a bath and I think my team needs to take

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.630 
a bath and I think my team needs to take
down<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.690> enemy<00:04:35.720> jets<00:04:36.650> or<00:04:36.890> these<00:04:37.130> enemy

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
down the enemy jets or these enemy

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.790 
down the enemy jets or these enemy
helicopters<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.330> need<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.930> just<00:04:39.650> be

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
helicopters that need to just be

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.170 
helicopters that need to just be
eliminated<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.460> probably<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.820> definitely

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
eliminated it probably it definitely

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.420 
eliminated it probably it definitely
will<00:04:41.240> be<00:04:41.300> something<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.750> switch<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:43.220> order

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
will be something I switch to in order

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.510 
will be something I switch to in order
to<00:04:43.580> do<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:44.060> as<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:45.080> see<00:04:45.290> here<00:04:45.530> probably<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
to do that as we see here probably the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.500 
to do that as we see here probably the
worst<00:04:46.700> jet<00:04:47.000> dirt

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510

vehicles when using be the passive radar
missiles<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.070> just<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:07.430> it's<00:05:07.880> just<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.120> fact

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100

when you are running the passive radar
missiles<00:05:15.170> I<00:05:15.260> do<00:05:15.440> recommend<00:05:16.040> as<00:05:16.460> a

missiles I do recommend as a

I<00:05:19.940> have<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.540> best<00:05:20.720> luck<00:05:20.900> with<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.110> because<00:05:21.650> I

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
I have the best luck with that because I

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.220 
I have the best luck with that because I
would<00:05:22.460> get<00:05:22.700> snuck<00:05:23.000> up<00:05:23.180> on<00:05:23.330> by<00:05:23.390> things<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.110> I'm

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
would get snuck up on by things if I'm

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.480 
would get snuck up on by things if I'm
looking<00:05:24.530> up<00:05:24.650> in<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.830> air<00:05:24.920> trying<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.310> take<00:05:25.400> a

you're trying to stay on target there so

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.910

he<00:06:13.640> thinks<00:06:14.060> I'm<00:06:14.210> going<00:06:14.450> around<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.930> island<00:06:15.190> so

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
he thinks I'm going around the island so

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.070 
he thinks I'm going around the island so
what<00:06:16.340> do<00:06:16.400> I<00:06:16.490> do<00:06:16.640> I<00:06:17.000> use<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.600> wave<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.930> my

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
what do I do I use the wave to my

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.990 
what do I do I use the wave to my
advantage<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.650> loop<00:06:19.040> around<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.460> other<00:06:19.700> way

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
advantage I loop around the other way

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.240 
advantage I loop around the other way
because<00:06:20.240> I<00:06:20.570> know<00:06:21.200> he<00:06:21.500> thinks<00:06:21.770> I'm<00:06:22.010> going

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
because I know he thinks I'm going

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.680 
because I know he thinks I'm going
around<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.640> island<00:06:22.669> cuz<00:06:23.180> that's<00:06:23.330> what<00:06:23.480> most

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
around the island cuz that's what most

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.610 
around the island cuz that's what most
people<00:06:23.780> would<00:06:24.230> do<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:24.860> by<00:06:25.930> reversing<00:06:26.930> what<00:06:27.169> he

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
people would do and by reversing what he

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.300 
people would do and by reversing what he
thinks<00:06:28.160> I<00:06:28.900> can<00:06:29.900> actually<00:06:30.140> get<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.740> one-up<00:06:31.190> on

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
thinks I can actually get the one-up on

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.020 
thinks I can actually get the one-up on
now<00:06:31.640> I<00:06:31.910> am<00:06:32.270> behind<00:06:32.720> him<00:06:33.370> this<00:06:34.370> is<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:34.850> way<00:06:34.970> you

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
now I am behind him this is the way you

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.310 
now I am behind him this is the way you
have<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.330> think<00:06:35.690> when<00:06:35.840> you're<00:06:35.870> playing<00:06:36.169> in

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
have to think when you're playing in

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.740 
have to think when you're playing in
vehicles<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:37.400> have<00:06:37.580> to<00:06:37.729> do<00:06:37.880> exactly<00:06:38.090> what<00:06:38.600> the

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
vehicles you have to do exactly what the

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.220 
vehicles you have to do exactly what the
enemy

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
enemy

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.950

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
doesn't think you're going to do and I
