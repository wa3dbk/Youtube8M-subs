00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
material in there and then now we just

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.109 
material in there and then now we just
want<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.880> use<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:44.679> synthetic<00:01:45.670> oil<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
and afterwards so that's gonna be that

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.340 
and afterwards so that's gonna be that
there's<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.710> water<00:01:50.920> pump<00:01:51.869> part<00:01:52.869> number<00:01:53.170> there

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
there's the water pump part number there

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.090 
there's the water pump part number there
on<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.679> SI<00:01:54.189> water<00:01:54.460> pump<00:01:54.729> if<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.119> need<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.750> or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
on the SI water pump if you need it or

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.620 
on the SI water pump if you need it or
an<00:01:57.100> extra<00:01:57.369> gasket<00:01:57.850> didn't<00:01:58.240> know<00:01:58.299> that<00:01:58.479> came

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
an extra gasket didn't know that came

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810 
an extra gasket didn't know that came
with<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:58.960> but<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.409> guess<00:01:59.710> it<00:01:59.859> did<00:02:00.039> all<00:02:00.729> right

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
with one but I guess it did all right

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
now back to the cylinder head we're

we've<00:02:39.730> checked<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.970> service<00:02:40.239> limit<00:02:40.599> on<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
we've checked the service limit on the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.839 
we've checked the service limit on the
head<00:02:41.049> they<00:02:41.680> had<00:02:41.829> didn't<00:02:42.099> need<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.370> machined

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
head they had didn't need to be machined

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.120 
head they had didn't need to be machined
basically<00:02:43.630> how<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.840> do<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.950> put

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
basically how you do that is you you put

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.089 
basically how you do that is you you put
a<00:02:45.269> precision<00:02:46.269> flat<00:02:46.660> edge<00:02:46.870> right<00:02:47.590> across<00:02:47.799> here

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
a precision flat edge right across here

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.900 
a precision flat edge right across here
and<00:02:48.370> measure<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.390> points<00:02:49.750> where<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and measure on the points where the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110 
and measure on the points where the
cylinders<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.930> are<00:02:53.049> gonna<00:02:53.230> open<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.829> mean<00:02:54.130> are

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
cylinders here are gonna open I mean are

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.150 
cylinders here are gonna open I mean are
gonna<00:02:55.299> separate<00:02:55.750> from<00:02:56.319> one<00:02:56.560> cylinder<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
gonna separate from one cylinder to the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
gonna separate from one cylinder to the
other<00:02:57.280> measure<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.819> these<00:02:58.000> points<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.510> measured

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
other measure on these points I measured

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.180 
other measure on these points I measured
on<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.319> outsides<00:02:59.709> here

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
on the outsides here

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.809 
on the outsides here
imagine<00:03:00.970> basically<00:03:01.269> three<00:03:01.480> points<00:03:01.810> 1<00:03:01.989> 2<00:03:02.459> 3<00:03:03.459> and

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
imagine basically three points 1 2 3 and

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.009 
imagine basically three points 1 2 3 and
if<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.049> within<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.410> service<00:03:05.709> limit<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:07.630> do

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
within the service limit you don't have

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.930 
within the service limit you don't have
to<00:03:10.840> machine<00:03:10.959> because<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.440> can<00:03:11.530> only<00:03:11.620> get<00:03:11.799> a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
to machine because you can only get a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.520 
to machine because you can only get a
machine<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:12.970> two<00:03:13.209> on<00:03:13.329> these<00:03:13.510> heads

machine or two on these heads

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.289 
machine or two on these heads
otherwise<00:03:15.220> they'll<00:03:15.549> start<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.180> get

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
otherwise they'll start and get
