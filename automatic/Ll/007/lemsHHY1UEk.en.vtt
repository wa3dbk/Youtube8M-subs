00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.780
 servus we are in the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.749
 playlist testens on the go 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.549
 I would like that was important today 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.549
 Introducing a complete group of customers 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 how do the components work together? 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.720
 price performance ratio the weight 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 is currently in the bike park as would like 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 I'll talk about it today 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.759
 we have today it was then what he was 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.220
 with a complete shimano you group 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.170
 the bike is equipped now 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.320
 used effectively for about two years 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 so also the equipment and I would 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 let's just go for a ride 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.359
 down at the crank out at the church 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.350
 will definitely not be stable 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.039
 saved up 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 He really does hold out a lot too 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.820
 microsoft put on either 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.640
 no problem at all, of course, clear 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 that you see things here or here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.829
 normal wear where the paint off 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 goes through the kick at the turn it goes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.089
 in my opinion is quite fast 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.830
 but of course only a little bit off 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.390
 little optical deficiency and goes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.630
 Of course not with other curve 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.520
 necessarily much slower 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 where it is now more right from the design ago 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 kept simple but now here for 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 example alternative with the chainring 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.440
 screw it looks the same beautiful 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.620
 but from the function perfect 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.720
 small minus, of course, the weight 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.820
 The crank brings a whopping 900 grams 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.510
 approximately on the scales yes most 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.690
 even measure about 850 as an approximate 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.690
 come 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 yes then it goes on brakes brake 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 always big topic the brake too of the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 design is very simple 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.799
 they just know what I time with you 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 So all that great this place here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.149
 empty way is quite big, of course, too 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.100
 always a matter of feeling 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.829
 but he comes back soon 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 The man has a lot of music from here 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.269
 pulls then right is already right 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.989
 he weighs a lot but really pulls 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.730
 really good at feasibility 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.769
 100% super cool 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.170
 google really appreciates building but 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.940
 in down definitely enough and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.849
 in the bikepark we also had from 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.760
 pressure point no problems and that will be 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.670
 Although hot but by being natural 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.489
 a pretty big brake caliper is with 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 four pistons the system 200 mm 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.540
 brake discs and of course here 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.150
 This cooled brake pads only has 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.180
 with temperature at that you little row 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.280
 problems clearly weight this again 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 is with her, I say so now 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.989
 Cost comes where the money is saved 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.049
 and now everything has money too 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.410
 not put in therefore minus point 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.060
 has the weight 30 of course optimal 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 So that's really for people 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.079
 recession the big one such a big one 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.109
 have purse shimano definitely 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.450
 they do not do anything 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.459
 Wrong from the service so with her 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.709
 maybe once a year maybe 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.180
 vent if any after the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.940
 stop the brake often used 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.470
 if you have to be air it is 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.389
 really not difficult is mineral oil 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.299
 So that was no problem at all 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.579
 Do it well on your own 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.680
 So there really is a big plus point 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.030
 to the shimano she wants me then 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.980
 maybe something very short to say about it 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.650
 Now, of course, a well says but 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.269
 saint is much better, of course, 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.859
 no case is any easier 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.489
 lightweight but lighter than that 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.260
 whole painting but it's just easy 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.810
 just a bit more expensive and then he still 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.670
 thought for longer departures because the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.190
 hallen better in the heat 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.340
 regulation of the networks 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.040
 to heat up and supposedly they should 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.750
 also more biting or firmer 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.220
 pull 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.110
 I am now a completely different opinion 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.240
 if you notice a difference 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.790
 sometimes just good i got myself 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.740
 pulls now better than dc some 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.890
 from the experience values ​​necessarily 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.890
 say 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.000
 maybe to the founder for a short time 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.030
 works fine no problems 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.549
 can be set up well tells 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.830
 Schaltwerk yes we had none so far 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.690
 problems with that especially with the 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.300
 showdown plus technology 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.310
 that is optimal so there you really have 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.500
 on the trail or at pac little hit 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.150
 it is completely prevented on the chain 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.070
 Of course not but you listen to everyone 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.270
 There is nothing left and that is mine 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.650
 opinion are after a very successful 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.290
 fiction may always say 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.900
 In any case very nice, then that 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.550
 It will sound robust without end 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 So there we are already a few times 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.620
 where did that actually go? 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.350
 quite a bit and of pretending he 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.750
 Actually, very little changes 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.190
 So you have to adjust a little and there 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.720
 if you have to turn it off, too 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.030
 not difficult and it can be done very early 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.730
 Off 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.160
 that's for the target group for our shimano 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.050
 Small test thereby helped for 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.490
 people have the little purse but 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.280
 really a lot of power and 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.320
 stability of bikepark current or on 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.390
 want to have their thumb attacks it 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.620
 she grasps , there really is 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.620
 for little money
