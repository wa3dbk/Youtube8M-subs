got<00:05:33.870> nothing<00:05:34.200> else<00:05:34.350> like<00:05:34.620> that's<00:05:34.830> always<00:05:34.980> got

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
got nothing else like that's always got

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.400 
got nothing else like that's always got
wow<00:05:36.270> man<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.690> don't<00:05:36.900> know<00:05:36.990> if<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.200> really

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
wow man I don't know if you really

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.540 
wow man I don't know if you really
should<00:05:37.590> be<00:05:37.680> put<00:05:37.860> in<00:05:37.950> charge<00:05:38.190> as<00:05:38.340> showrunner

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
should be put in charge as showrunner

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.610 
should be put in charge as showrunner
but<00:05:38.940> obviously<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:40.080> know<00:05:40.170> maybe<00:05:40.380> he's

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
but obviously you know maybe he's

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.050 
but obviously you know maybe he's
impressed<00:05:40.980> them<00:05:41.190> on<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.370> show<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:41.910> makes

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
impressed them on the show so it makes

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.340 
impressed them on the show so it makes
sense<00:05:42.240> for<00:05:42.390> them<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.630> put<00:05:42.750> him<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:42.960> charge<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:43.320> I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
sense for them to put him in charge so I

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.350 
sense for them to put him in charge so I
trust<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.160> decision<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.640> sounds<00:05:44.940> good<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.330> I

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
trust the decision it sounds good and I

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.000 
trust the decision it sounds good and I
guess<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.600> be<00:05:45.720> better<00:05:45.930> than<00:05:46.110> having<00:05:46.770> somebody

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
guess to be better than having somebody

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.410 
guess to be better than having somebody
who<00:05:47.190> hasn't<00:05:47.400> been<00:05:47.580> working<00:05:47.760> on<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.060> show<00:05:48.210> as<00:05:48.390> a

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
who hasn't been working on the show as a

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.880 
who hasn't been working on the show as a
producer<00:05:48.720> right<00:05:49.080> or<00:05:49.230> anything<00:05:49.620> just<00:05:49.800> come

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
producer right or anything just come

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.520 
producer right or anything just come
onboard<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.400> do<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.270> those<00:05:51.960> episodes

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
onboard and do it so and those episodes

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.740 
onboard and do it so and those episodes
that<00:05:52.860> he<00:05:53.010> wrote<00:05:53.250> were<00:05:53.490> stellar<00:05:53.820> so<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.540> guess

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
that he wrote were stellar so I guess

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.780 
that he wrote were stellar so I guess
it'll<00:05:54.960> make<00:05:55.110> sense<00:05:55.290> so<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.740> am<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.460> excited<00:05:56.640> for

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
it'll make sense so I am so excited for

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.220 
it'll make sense so I am so excited for
season<00:05:57.150> four<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.570> don't<00:05:57.780> think<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:57.960> ruins

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
season four I don't think it ruins

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.390 
season four I don't think it ruins
anything<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.590> think<00:05:58.740> it'll<00:05:58.860> still<00:05:58.920> be<00:05:59.190> really

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
anything I think it'll still be really

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.930 
anything I think it'll still be really
really<00:05:59.670> good<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:01.140> don't<00:06:01.500> I<00:06:01.980> think<00:06:02.310> that

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
really good and I don't I think that

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.970 
really good and I don't I think that
it'll<00:06:03.510> work<00:06:03.600> out<00:06:03.870> pretty<00:06:04.080> good<00:06:04.260> either<00:06:04.440> way<00:06:04.590> I

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
it'll work out pretty good either way I

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.980 
it'll work out pretty good either way I

know<00:06:22.290> anywhere<00:06:22.560> near<00:06:22.800> that<00:06:22.920> kind<00:06:23.160> of<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.310> league

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
know anywhere near that kind of a league

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.330 
know anywhere near that kind of a league
but<00:06:24.500> whatever<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:25.620> mean<00:06:25.830> it's<00:06:26.010> still<00:06:26.160> gonna<00:06:26.250> be

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
but whatever I mean it's still gonna be

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.340 
but whatever I mean it's still gonna be
good<00:06:26.580> anyway<00:06:26.940> season<00:06:27.360> four<00:06:27.570> that<00:06:27.780> got<00:06:27.930> lots<00:06:28.140> to

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
good anyway season four that got lots to

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.230 
good anyway season four that got lots to
draw<00:06:28.530> from<00:06:28.800> they<00:06:29.250> still<00:06:29.460> have<00:06:29.550> Robert<00:06:29.910> Kirkman

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
draw from they still have Robert Kirkman

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.370 
draw from they still have Robert Kirkman
which<00:06:30.390> is<00:06:30.540> really<00:06:30.750> what<00:06:30.900> they<00:06:31.020> need<00:06:31.200> if<00:06:31.320> they

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
which is really what they need if they

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.130 
which is really what they need if they
didn't<00:06:31.710> have<00:06:31.830> him<00:06:32.100> then<00:06:32.910> you<00:06:33.510> know<00:06:33.630> we<00:06:33.960> could

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
didn't have him then you know we could

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.180 
didn't have him then you know we could
be<00:06:34.230> in<00:06:34.320> trouble<00:06:34.350> but<00:06:34.770> I<00:06:34.800> think<00:06:34.980> would<00:06:35.040> be

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
be in trouble but I think would be

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.100 
be in trouble but I think would be
alright<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.700> anyway<00:06:36.360> I<00:06:36.390> think<00:06:36.570> it'll<00:06:36.810> be<00:06:36.990> good

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
alright so anyway I think it'll be good

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.270 
alright so anyway I think it'll be good
I<00:06:37.170> don't<00:06:37.380> think<00:06:37.470> it'll<00:06:37.680> really<00:06:37.800> matter<00:06:38.070> too

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
I don't think it'll really matter too

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.550 
I don't think it'll really matter too
much<00:06:38.420> to<00:06:39.420> be<00:06:39.540> honest<00:06:39.810> we<00:06:39.930> probably<00:06:40.170> won't<00:06:40.350> even

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
much to be honest we probably won't even

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.630 
much to be honest we probably won't even
know<00:06:40.650> it's<00:06:40.830> too<00:06:40.950> much<00:06:40.980> of<00:06:41.160> a<00:06:41.310> difference

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
know it's too much of a difference

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.580 
know it's too much of a difference
although<00:06:42.090> maybe<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:42.840> pacing<00:06:43.230> will<00:06:43.350> slow<00:06:43.560> down

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
although maybe the pacing will slow down

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.040 
although maybe the pacing will slow down
a<00:06:43.830> little<00:06:44.100> bit<00:06:44.310> Jesus<00:06:44.730> hell<00:06:45.150> man<00:06:45.510> it's<00:06:45.690> going

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
a little bit Jesus hell man it's going

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.710 
a little bit Jesus hell man it's going
so<00:06:46.170> fast<00:06:46.380> late<00:06:46.680> it's<00:06:46.920> crazy<00:06:47.160> crazy<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:48.540> much

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
so fast late it's crazy crazy so much

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.940 
so fast late it's crazy crazy so much
stuff<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.080> even<00:06:49.290> in<00:06:49.350> the<00:06:49.410> trailer<00:06:49.650> too<00:06:49.860> it

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
stuff and even in the trailer too it

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
stuff and even in the trailer too it
looks<00:06:50.010> like<00:06:50.220> it's<00:06:50.310> not<00:06:50.400> going<00:06:50.580> to<00:06:50.640> slow<00:06:50.790> down

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
looks like it's not going to slow down

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.970 
looks like it's not going to slow down
at<00:06:51.120> all<00:06:51.210> so<00:06:51.990> we'll<00:06:52.080> see<00:06:52.260> what<00:06:52.380> happens<00:06:52.410> but
