 I will reach them perfectly 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 by step so they can share it 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.599

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 link so well let's start 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.720
 perfect standard tunings and chicken 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.720
 I know how we started 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.590
 Y 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.410
 Y 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 ah 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 perfect we start first with the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.009
 positions we start with the first 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.560
 arrangement 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.200
 let's press our fingers in the sun 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 as we study in sun we are rather 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.680
 on the sun 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.630
 and we're going to play from the sixth to the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 second rope nothing more 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 the tache indicates that we do not touch that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.100
 rope is dappled and nothing else here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.470
 traits go down down towards 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
 down that's why it's very simple 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.710
 the song as we take care below 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.710
 down down down all the time that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 we start 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.850
 and 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.610
 as they realize first we touch up 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.330
 the second string and now if we play the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.550
 first air we go up 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
 and we play again towards the second 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.370
 rope but this time to the air the finger 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.900
 number 2 the 3 forgiveness helps us to mold 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.530
 the first slowest string 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.530
 d 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 ok we repeat this again 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.060
 and then we move on to the next arrangement 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.410
 we put the number 1 on the fret 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.490
 number 5 string 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.490
 all right 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.440
 and then with the number 3 finger we play 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.440
 seventh fret of the rope number 2 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.950
 now we move on to the next arrangement 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.980

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.500
