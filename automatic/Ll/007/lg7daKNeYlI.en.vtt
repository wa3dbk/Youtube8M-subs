00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.040 
we don't do it before because many many
of<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.840> fish<00:02:42.050> look<00:02:42.380> very<00:02:43.070> much<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> same<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
of the fish look very much the same so

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.870 
of the fish look very much the same so
we<00:02:45.050> take<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> picture<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.950> make<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
we take a picture and make the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.040 
we take a picture and make the
certificate<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:49.240> we<00:02:50.240> do<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> measurement

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
certificate and we do the measurement

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
certificate and we do the measurement
and<00:02:51.520> then<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.700> bring<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.090> fish<00:02:53.300> home<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
and then you bring the fish home and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.140 
and then you bring the fish home and
start<00:02:55.070> growing<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:57.010> many<00:02:58.010> many<00:02:58.340> good

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
start growing and we have many many good

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.230 
start growing and we have many many good
hobbyist<00:03:00.020> for<00:03:00.440> doing<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.860> in<00:03:01.240> in

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
hobbyist for doing this in in

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.100 
hobbyist for doing this in in
Scandinavia<00:03:03.280> one<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.520> reasons<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.480> we

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
Scandinavia one of the reasons is we

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.710 
Scandinavia one of the reasons is we
have<00:03:06.260> very<00:03:06.590> cold<00:03:06.920> winters<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:08.060> many<00:03:08.330> people

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
have very cold winters so many people

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.190 
have very cold winters so many people
have<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.230> made<00:03:09.440> experiments<00:03:10.780> with<00:03:11.780> indoor

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
have have made experiments with indoor

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.010 
have have made experiments with indoor
systems<00:03:12.710> but<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.610> course<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:14.270> also<00:03:14.570> possible

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
systems but of course it's also possible

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.730 
systems but of course it's also possible
to<00:03:15.320> do<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.650> outside<00:03:16.630> because<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:18.470> not<00:03:18.680> just

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
to do it outside because it's not just

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.840 
to do it outside because it's not just
the<00:03:19.130> spring<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.700> when<00:03:20.150> we<00:03:20.300> start<00:03:20.570> now<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:22.700> are

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
one of them is very new so we try to

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.120 
one of them is very new so we try to
follow<00:03:53.720> what<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.200> do<00:03:54.350> here<00:03:54.650> because<00:03:54.980> it's

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
follow what you do here because it's

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.910 
follow what you do here because it's
very<00:03:55.280> twisting<00:03:55.760> us<00:03:56.270> contest<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:57.710> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
very twisting us contest to have the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.150 
very twisting us contest to have the
biggest<00:03:58.070> koi<00:03:58.490> after<00:03:59.120> five<00:03:59.420> months<00:04:00.160> not

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
biggest koi after five months not

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.460 
biggest koi after five months not
normally<00:04:01.580> because<00:04:01.820> we<00:04:02.180> don't<00:04:02.390> do<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:03.320> this

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
normally because we don't do it in this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.620 
normally because we don't do it in this
country<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.640> distinct<00:04:05.180> first<00:04:05.420> to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
country so it's a distinct first to

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.990 
country so it's a distinct first to
follow<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.990> yeah<00:04:06.800> but<00:04:07.250> i'm<00:04:07.400> pretty<00:04:07.640> sure<00:04:07.790> that

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
follow you yeah but i'm pretty sure that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.300 
follow you yeah but i'm pretty sure that
you<00:04:08.450> will<00:04:08.660> follow<00:04:08.900> many<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.709> fish<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.130> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
you will follow many of the fish in the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.130 
you will follow many of the fish in the
years<00:04:10.790> also<00:04:11.230> later<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:13.630> what<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.780> didn't<00:04:15.110> know

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
years also later on what we didn't know

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.320 
years also later on what we didn't know
from<00:04:15.500> last<00:04:15.740> time<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.549> could<00:04:16.730> make<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> price

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
from last time is we could make a price

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:24.100 
from last time is we could make a price
for<00:04:18.430> biggest<00:04:19.430> one<00:04:20.080> first<00:04:21.080> one<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:22.060> DCM<00:04:23.110> it's

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
for biggest one first one a DCM it's

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.520 
for biggest one first one a DCM it's
only<00:04:24.440> two<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.830> half<00:04:24.979> year<00:04:25.220> old

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
only two and a half year old

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.780 
only two and a half year old
I<00:04:26.000> think<00:04:27.020> these<00:04:28.020> fish<00:04:28.320> will<00:04:28.740> grow<00:04:29.040> even<00:04:29.070> bigger

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
I think these fish will grow even bigger

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.990 
I think these fish will grow even bigger
we<00:04:30.750> will<00:04:30.780> see<00:04:31.080> more<00:04:31.290> than<00:04:31.500> 81cm<00:04:32.160> after<00:04:32.730> two<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
we will see more than 81cm after two and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.990 
we will see more than 81cm after two and
a<00:04:33.090> half<00:04:33.240> year<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.110> I'm<00:04:34.860> very<00:04:35.280> curious<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.669> see
