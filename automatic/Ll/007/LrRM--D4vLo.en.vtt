00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.740
 hi guys today's video we will 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.940
 take a tour of the new 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:50.270
 lines in a thousand days my nejm twins 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.220
 What are these two girls here like me? 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.930
 I'm changing some things in the bedroom. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.200
 so I decided to make this new place 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 Honey, now it's somewhere else. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.460
 and I left this space to mount a 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.220
 park here is the corner where they eat 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.920
 on the wall are comics one of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.750
 planting and a bird underneath here 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.650
 we have two power chairs 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.610
 and the trash cans to put some 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.010
 Food stuffing is not the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.930
 something to play with even for 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.170
 exploring the imagination are two dumpsters 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.170
 a rose and a rock with sells the two 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.990
 they have green there behind there is a walk 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.190
 because the dollar the bc the total in that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 kind of walks that is mag and obese 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.140
 my here we have a way of 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.909
 mag amec for those who do not know about my 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.260
 walks in the crib 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.120
 It's not how I can say I do not 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.920
 I managed to make two identical cribs 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.350
 because I did not even try so I put the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.250
 his way was very beautiful has 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.479
 pink and yellow flower pillows 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.909
 and this fight is that of her little baby 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.000
 which is different even 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:14.530
 the ball they play here is the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.780
 Mac guys end up perfectly on the table 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.140
 here we have the dresser that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.370
 contrary to the active as it does not open the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.019
 Another room I do not know how I lost then 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.970
 Since I did not want to try work again, I 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.390
 I did not save anything on the table so I did 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.890
 that same and help and we would be 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.540
 I did just to give a touch more 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.580
 is improvised even though I 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.490
 to be able to do more primitive but how 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.220
 cute thai little window with this background 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.209
 blue behind the claim that it is a sky 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.620
 something like this and here are some little toys 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.340
 which is a bit of hunger so I 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 I put this famous trump among them 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.330
 We have my friend who needs it. 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.740
 of a shower and finally we arrived 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.739
 here in the kiss 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.750
 This is the kiss that my sweetheart 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.040
 sometimes I change the average soon 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.319
 put mine 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.480
 Then let this be the bc is with the light. 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.480
 is another little doll she plays with 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.140
 so I leave both so one sleeps 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.140
 in bed and another on the bin 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.720
 the toy is the axis of this 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.379
 pink box 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.030
 I place the other of the teaching value as 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.220
 they are little ones i did not think 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.610
 needed a larger space can 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.459
 look like the same place and I left this 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.430
 cut in the state and I will leave because 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.010
 gives a super cool effect on the shelf 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.030
 decoration neat all nice fluffy gouache 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.480
 created 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.670
 and this is exactly what you are right 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.260
 if you want to have something more 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.420
 any idea to fight again in the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.470
 room you can give us there 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.980
 comments 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.069
 something I can do to let the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.709
 nicest room right there're missing the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.680
 baby carriage I had one more 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.419

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.220
