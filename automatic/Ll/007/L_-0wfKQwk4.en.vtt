00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.880
 such ago 2013 stand lg we have the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.460
 brand new LG Gipat 8.3 is a tablet 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.400
 just a 8.3-inch size 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.199
 which we think is ideal for having the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.029
 better balance between portability 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.980
 you see that I keep it in common 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.919
 hand and the maximum visual rendering of a 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.779
 8.3 inch ips display with 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.909
 full hd quality 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.739
 a quality that we are the first to put 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.320
 on a display of this cut then a 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.970
 8-inch display is a tablet is a lot 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.460
 light weight as much as a daily weight 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.650
 more or less 338 grams and is also a lot 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.210
 cared for in the aesthetic part because the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 back is completely in 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.720
 aluminum and therefore would also have to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 tact and above all a very product 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.600
 very light as we have already told al 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.340
 display side 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 the display we have already spoken but to his 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.880
 inside we have two elements 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.430
 fundamental the first is the processor a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.830
 quad core snapdragon 600 processor 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 then produced by qualcomm from 1.7 giger 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.680
 gives you everything 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.750
 the power needed to have 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.509
 a full hd experience at the top and why not 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.310
 even in gaming an experience of 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.790
 excellent videogame and then to his 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.040
 indoor 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.330
 we have a 4,600 milia battery for 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 now that also allows you to have 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.050
 a truly excellent range in the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.909
 case of applications we have taken 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.970
 what is the experience of g2 e 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.140
 we also carried it on ipad to 8.3 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.380
 what this means 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.390
 multitasking for example we have the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.430
 possibility to use the live cus the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 cus live allows you to put more 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.000
 applications in the window just as if 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.860
 we are as if we were on our pc 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 so for example we can look at one 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.310
 video in the window go to regular 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.350
 possibly transparency and then 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.120
 we can do more then activate 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.830
 maybe the email in this case not 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.180
 we have the active provider here we go 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.820
 select another application that 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.140
 slides and the calendar for example 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 and while we watch the video we can 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.979
 act on our calendar set up 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.640
 eventually of the events and things of the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.860
 gender 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.150
 or always for multitasking but that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.060
 think differently 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.890
 we have the possibility for example 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.930
 set aside applications for 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 example where youtube we put aside 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.380
 then we know that the music that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.480
 here too we drag and we already have it 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.920
 we already have two we already have among the three 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.540
 the maximum number of applications we can 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.069
 set aside with three fingers 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.450
 drag from left to right and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.160
 we can resume ours 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.560
 applications previously set by 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.849
 part this is slide and said and then 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.540
 we have another feature that is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.250
 unique chipata 8.3 which is called more 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.370
 for this apple we can demonstrate with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.319
 our g2 that we have here 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.870
 in the demo station how it works more 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 to connect to our g2 smartphone 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.390
 or any other android smartphone 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 because the application will be available 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.709
 to download on place tor 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.010
 in this case it is connected with the g2 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.110
 white if I should now call the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.170
 g2 white from this black g2 you see that 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.489
 a notification will appear on the tablet 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.170
 because the moment we are 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.970
 using a tablet in this case a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.080
 tablet or wifi we are on the sofa and the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.650
 phone maybe it's not ours 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.120
 flow 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.430
 we can get a call 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.739
 directly close the call or 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.140
 send a quick courtesy text message to 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.880
 avoid getting up from the couch and this 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.380
 type of connection then works in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 several other ways for example we can 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.190
 also answer a text message directly 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.290
 or we can recover the last one 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.760
 application used on ours 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.630
 smartphone and then find us the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.040
 directly on lg gb hard 8.31 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.250
 lg gip to auto point 3 will be available 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.319
 in two colors black and white will come 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.880
 by the end of the year also in Italy 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.590
 and will have 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.829
 naturally expandable with micro 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.750
 up to 64 gigabytes we take advantage of the per 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.480
 see what the interfaces are 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.340
 therefore on the side we find the volume keys 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.930
 the power button you see in the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.310
 rear back 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.260
 completely in aluminum that therefore 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.389
 favors the lightness of the device 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 then we have the 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.290
 rear two speakers for audio 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.359
 stereo to maximize listening 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.859
 even when we are using it without 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.590
 the earphones instead in the part 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.050
 top what we have 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.640
 we have the door to the big ones 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.989
 use the remote quick function 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.580
 so this also becomes a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.010
 universal remote control to control 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.690
 tv home theater systems the decoder of 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.269
 sky and so on 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.120
 then we have the earphone jack 3.5 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.479
 and then we have the slot for the micro sd 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.380
 up to 64 gigabytes while in the 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.780
 rear 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.240
 sorry at the bottom we have 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.800
 obviously the microphone and then we have the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.060
 jack that can be used 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.340
 of course for charging for the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.630
 connection with the PC but also as a port 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 slim port for connection 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.950
 directly to television with the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.110
 1080p cable with hdmi 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.660
 or with VGA cable of course mi 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.720
 will need a slimport adapter between 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.940
 the other this is a tablet that also has 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 the plug and pop function then in the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.039
 moment in which we go for example to 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.210
 connect any device to 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.610
 example usb 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.080
 we have the possibility to read the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.120
 content of our memory card 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.680
 usb and then to copy it cures to 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.780
 play it directly on your smartphone 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.669
 and here you see this is the plug function 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.460
 in people we have connected and come 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.139
 out directly the menu of what 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.910
 we can do so we can to know 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.990
 whether to activate music or video 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.990
 or other things
