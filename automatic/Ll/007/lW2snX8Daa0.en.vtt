along<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.740> through<00:02:00.920> here<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.700> took<00:02:02.000> and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
along it through here that I took and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.790 
along it through here that I took and
then<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.420> course<00:02:02.480> your<00:02:02.780> water<00:02:02.960> started

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
then of course your water started

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.830 
then of course your water started
flowing<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:04.070> lot<00:02:04.160> faster<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.970> then<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.690> could

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
flowing a lot faster and then I could

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.120 
flowing a lot faster and then I could
just<00:02:06.020> take<00:02:06.170> my<00:02:06.230> bucket<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.300> run<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.420> through

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
just take my bucket and run it through

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.820 
just take my bucket and run it through
so<00:02:10.990> it's<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.110> real<00:02:12.290> simple<00:02:13.060> easy<00:02:14.060> way<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:15.709> know

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so it's a real simple easy way you know

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800 
so it's a real simple easy way you know
you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.010> always<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:17.300> look<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.600> see<00:02:17.690> you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
you can always just look and see you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.330 
you can always just look and see you
know<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.290> made<00:02:18.440> go<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.010> any

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
elbow and on your bottom pipe that way

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.140 
elbow and on your bottom pipe that way
you<00:03:02.030> know<00:03:02.150> exactly<00:03:02.180> where<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.690> line<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.930> up<00:03:04.150> so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
you know exactly where to line it up so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.120 
you know exactly where to line it up so
of<00:03:06.049> course<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.470> know<00:03:06.560> when<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:06.830> get<00:03:06.950> done
