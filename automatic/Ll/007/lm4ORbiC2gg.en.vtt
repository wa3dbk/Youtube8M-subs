00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello how are you I'm welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.920
 my channel I tell you that today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.779
 I bring you a design that my mouth 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 very much my childhood to be in the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.519
 comments and you just like me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 they got these coloring books and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.710
 they played with their crayola das with the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.330
 colors to put a lot of them 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 environments and that's what we're going to do 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 today then it reminds us a lot of these 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 magazines because we're going to do about 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 white many lines and then we're going to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 let our imagination fly with the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.349
 colors so you and I are going to then 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.870
 for my base I chose white but you 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.290
 can choose to choose the color clear 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.950
 they want 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.220
 and I will start to simply draw 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.740
 or lines gathering them in this way 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.740
 then there I did as after 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.540
 Here I'm going to do 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.540
 one two triangles 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.530
 just play with the lines you do not know 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.780
 leave how to live if you want to imitate the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.990
 design that I'm doing would be perfect 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 if you can not also create your own 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.270
 coloring lines and spaces 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.869
 here I am making a triangle and then 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.869
 to separate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 and here I'm going to make different triangles 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.750
 to complement and be many 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 colors also seems a kind of 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.670
 tribal and I liked that a lot too 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.189
 then can you start playing 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.709
 with the colors they want I chose 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:46.960
 two tones this is a little frosty 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:49.750
 like with a golden champagne maybe 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.010
 and another that is a neo rosÃ© in that I 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 love and it goes very well then 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.290
 I'm going to do the spaces simply in 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.750
 each of them I will choose some 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.340
 sides where you can work 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.650
 well here I will show you a trick 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.590
 For example, this line is not very 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.450
 very thick and with this tone that is also 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.620
 super opaque what I did was 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.709
 slim the line they see it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.750
 well then if the color is translucent 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.909
 Well, it's going to be much more complex than 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.670
 this happens but when are the colors 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.620
 they are thus metallized or pastels although 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.080
 they contain white then it works very 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:36.920
 well that cover or maybe other errors 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 here I continue with my champagne color 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.530
 these six steps are already very very 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.340
 little ones among I do it pretty 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.629
 slowly, very carefully for maybe 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.629
 do not get out of line 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:01.750
 well now I'm going to do the spaces 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.750
 already with a neon pink color I love 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.500
 and so leave blank spaces 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.360
 and ready I'm still 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.940
 and I start to fill can for example 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.740
 use many more colors is simply 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.040
 let them take their imagination as they 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.040
 I say 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.950
 the others that leave large blocks do not 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.840
 so small because if it's not going to be 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.230
 much more complicated to fill them 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.989
 then leave spaces that can be 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.900
 fill in yes and see how I do the filling 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.770
 I put a thick drop and what I do is 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.930
 drag that same drop to fill 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.359
 all the space 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.240
 Yes, I already see that it starts 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.730
 become a little more translucent 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.260
 I come back and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.260
 and filling with another drop 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.260
 ready like the drops I'm using 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.180
 they are quite thick it is not necessary 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.819
 put two layers of this same tone 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.970
 because only by seeing one very doughy 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.290
 if already thick enough so 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.290
 we are doing this way 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.090
 well for my latest design that come 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.930
 many squares then here 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.620
 I follow very very slowly I put the drop and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.620
 drag 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.180
 maybe I'm going to do it a little 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.759
 of pink here up and ready 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.490
 now with black we are going to complement 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:46.379
 all our lines and maybe at 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.379
 enter some fillings with blacks 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.950
 and here we already see much more contrasted 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.420
 our design that same I did in all 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.150
 our nails 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.880
 remember here the brightness and protector 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.490
 to dry much faster and also 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.900
 shine forever this is our 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.490
 design I know you will like it 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.860
 very much so 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.960
 Give him like to share it with all his 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.260
 friends I send kisses and hugs 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.260
 return
