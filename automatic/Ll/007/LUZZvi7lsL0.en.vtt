you're saying is hard record run that we

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
you're saying is hard record run that we
had<00:00:26.160> we've<00:00:26.730> only<00:00:26.880> played<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> couple<00:00:27.570> times

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
had we've only played it a couple times

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.599 
had we've only played it a couple times
other<00:00:28.439> than<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.490> my

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
other than this I think this was my

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.490 
other than this I think this was my
fourth<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:31.099> playing<00:00:32.099> ever<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.140> set<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
fourth time playing ever and we set this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.720 
fourth time playing ever and we set this
record<00:00:34.710> whatever<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:35.430> time<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.700> played

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
record whatever the first time we played

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.840 
record whatever the first time we played
it<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:37.170> ended<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.649> being<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.010> ranks<00:00:38.399> six

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it and we ended up being like ranks six

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.650 
it and we ended up being like ranks six
hundred<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.360> something<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.660> then

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
