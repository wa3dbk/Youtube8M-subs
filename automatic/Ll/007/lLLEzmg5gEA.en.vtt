00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 yes and here we have some of the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719
 novelties 2013 brake and clutch levers 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.019
 maybe you can do a bit 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.470
 detail explain so that here is the 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.420
 extreme runner gt2 rc the novelty is this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 who has this tv faster 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 So you can during full throttle 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 one with the left side one can the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 imagine brake lever forward 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.769
 When the brake slows down, it is very 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 important in racing in race operation 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 and this lever is also up 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 works so is the special feature to the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 normal fx raise the 35 years 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.430
 are adjustable but not upwards 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.260
 fold 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 Here we have only a few parts 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 including handlebar stub and a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.200
 few small parts can us please 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 So something says that he is putting a new one 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.510
 super light gp supernett handlebars voice 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 the lightest on the market with 230 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.820
 gramm perfect for racing 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 suitable because also fast steering wheel 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 can be exchanged in a fall 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.309
 then we have something else to do here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 embellishment of the engine a tax 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.950
 Head nut colored anodized in five 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 different colors suitable individually 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.890
 on every fork program yes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.680
 a paraded discipline of you are yes 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.770
 The footrest systems for me extremely 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.990
 important in driving there you have too 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 a novelty 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.159
 So we have an improvement now 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 the original us a free gt that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.290
 This base is footrest attachment with the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.070
 Guinness has become known worldwide 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 in the beginning of the beginning of 2000 it was and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.200
 that's the new development now 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.850
 succession as 31 g / t 2 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.680
 again with this base plate or 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.150
 really all setting hate for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 the position of the remains of this rotatable 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 if for the boot is very 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780
 interesting for racing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.250
 does not wear out so fast anymore 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 and then everything just possible with the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.460
 guest facilities with a circuit 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.140
 clarification for the race track is very important 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.540
 Here we have the footpeg effects 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 Plant that's the pure racing footpegs 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.290
 plant without great 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.360
 Adjustments you can at least 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 still set three positions 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.350
 that you stop a centimeter 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.040
 back or up or down can come 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.030
 which is really synonymous with needle bearings 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.120
 that means absolutely 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.800
 backlash-free switching paths which also very much 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.600
 important for precise switching on the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 Racetrack 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.090
 yes you do not see her so often with you 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.420
 have the program what's up with it? 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.450
 yourself 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.610
 the company money goes is the japan 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.920
 importer for the company gilles and im 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.959
 In return, we present the products 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.510
 of money in germany and are 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.530
 That's why Germany became an importer 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.760
 and the impositions stand out 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.640
 especially by a superb 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.980
 processing quality so if you are 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.500
 as insider really times that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.540
 Milling compared with others 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.880
 companies in the german market says 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.820
 everyone absolutely absolutely gone 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.060
 the quality also from the scars too 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.040
 the painters quality that's that 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.040
 the paint shop in japan where also honda 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.860
 the whole thing he finished it from 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.350
 therefore, therefore 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.190
 really the highest quality has to be 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.190
 retrofit thank you
