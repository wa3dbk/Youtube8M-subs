00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 marvel locators started on already 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.789

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 to you in this onguingy first and I with 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 big line big skepticism 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 treat treated him did not sit behind 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 the year that for me she was there for a long time 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.239
 writer clear top tier sponsor 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.629
 the sponsor they are even more votes 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 if brother for example equal if pre-party 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.480
 we want and ultimate canteen them we would nobody 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 The archive of the mother of the reptiles seemed just 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 not bring a catastrophe and then from this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 I know something to push Katerina 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.940
 Apocalypse 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 at the Spencer somehow more simple he 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 did you bet specific characters 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 bet on precisely here damned 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.090
 people besides he walked more in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 social some kind of interaction in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.890
 economics into politics is me more 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 cling and principle yes and for and for his 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.619
 creativity I want to follow what I can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.570
 become a pro where so hickman is 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.549
 I think I basically expressed everything in opinion 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.850
 by infinite which i am quite 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.400
 said clearly that I am personally good hillman 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.979
 I think the writer is by the way aqua average 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.570
 because he is fantastic 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.340
 but unfortunately he completely forgets 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 sandy people trust in their hands 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.890
 like the captain and whether there is a piece of iron and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 so on does not come to me last 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.650
 drops but avengers thief he could not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 skip 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.649
 because well I have to look and when I 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.329
 I read the first issue very much and here with 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 gigantic she led the reader 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.680
 almost did not want to but as soon as I did 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.579
 did and flowers realized how is it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 interesting rn something that is not me for a long time not 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 like so much he says 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.630
 progestin never gave much 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.219
 I just liked me 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.200
 him that there it is so special 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.119
 really seemed interesting 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.189
 plot wars world 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.289
 here is the division into teams which 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.000
 is in 1 in honor of those council to carry 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.459
 and will not experience i will have to face 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 that is, there is well here spoilers again 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.790
 if there are dragons here the art of purpose is here 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.459
 there is some mega and invites in general it 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 cool which is cool is it dynamic it 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.230
 the most important hickman the Spaniards they went to 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.030
 another little path that is as avengers 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.599
 world he is not so pathos 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.280
 not only unnecessary pretentious as it was 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.110
 that is, if earlier this whole 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.140
 sai-fi forest fiction hickmann ah 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.540
 she was very hard on anyone 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.000
 secure spencer just take and create that 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.920
 history skip or which lead 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.360
 yourself as avengers 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.340
 of course it's all the same to me not at all 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.180
 the fact that i am the same income no hall there 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.420
 dragon or else 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.870
 common villains who will not bully 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.940
 ears but even considering what we have and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.760
 quite good really enough 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.370
 interesting start i really hope that 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.079
 him there will not tighten not bend 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.400
 im and so on because i'm 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.049
 I forgot that the expansion team is waiting 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.720
 because it is the main thing on Roshana 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.579
 what interests me in windows world is 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.530
 actually what will be the team from 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.299
 whom it will consist then these 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.060
 guys is the most important thing that me 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.889
 interested because well seriously not 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.079
 make the same in the walls need to take 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.030
 Someone personally, I think so 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.160
 let's see , I hope that my expectation 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.500
 come true that with regards to 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.540
 pattern then he does not like much 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.920
 more than obvious all that was in 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.870
 past tommy 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.819
 because well, that is, the house did not go 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.470
 avenger by any minutes 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.350
 after such a meter is shorter 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.340
 opinion is very close to the picture singing personally 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.560
 I have too much of him 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.750
 art picture I do not think that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 similar style together in comic 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.160
 how is it completely whipped in my 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.860
 from the general style I'm not close to style 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.860
 I consider him 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.420
 too much bank flow can be done so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.270
 say here in terms of drawing more 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.040
 backs of such costume details in 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.260
 characters in general in principle design 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.330
 characters so faces snails american zero 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.190
 bath so here it is clean like this but 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.880
 a little manga gives don't want to seem 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.530
 racist but still it seemed to me 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.239
 again I can't say anything to the pastor 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.150
 it really seems to me 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.190
 drawing means weak while i 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.080
 no sorry someone is salva arly 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.360
 de salva just don't remember my name 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.460
 but that person now has this not g40 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.980
 I love him loves himself 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.690
 good interpretation of the avengers 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.690
 which take a closer look that year 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.160
 done well go for quality 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.630
 especially at the end of the drawing just here 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.640
 if you first have a smart somehow 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.560
 not all of the city at the end of it 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.840
 really starts to seem better 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.570
 cool and very interesting the other side 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.910
 i like that but i'm characters 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.040
 still more hands cartoonish like 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 it is on the one hand knitting fast 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.400
 some waste of those avengers who 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.100
 I will come to see because he is 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.960
 This but before in the walls all were such 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 all people like people yes all with the same 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.979
 figures and so on practically here at 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.850
 us brooke banner is such a future drishch 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.820
 some 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.370
 how is there america this jock wide 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.320
 shoulders shoulders yes everything is so pure comics 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.350
 which post style cartoon principle 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.540
 even very interesting very much hope 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.360
 but on the podium sky they will continue 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.860
 same line in two styles will not be forgotten and 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.479
 because at the moment we 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.700
 really starting to like what 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.490
 going on with this creation so to speak 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.130
 and this is a sieve of coffee in which i am able to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.790
 put a specific release 7 half 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.090
 out of 10 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.570
 because I lured but only already 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.210
 there is closer to 2 3 1 3 plus a bunch of culture 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.740
 wade through it all later 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.930
 you are bringing something interesting here but here 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.210
 driving through first pages 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.520
 I will put the eight as well 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.620

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.630
 advise so recommend not 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.910

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.040
 everything can change let's see all the same 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.090
 the main thing he fails fantastic 8 himself 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.800
 Number 1 good good start 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.300
 so what do we end to discuss 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.000
