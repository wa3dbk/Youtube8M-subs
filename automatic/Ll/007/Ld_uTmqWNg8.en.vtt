hey guys want to get a video of the XP
of<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.360> done<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.870> far<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:17.070> changed<00:00:17.820> a

changed a few things on it remember

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.269 
changed a few things on it remember
before<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.890> fuselage<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> had<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.179> square

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
before the fuselage I had it all square

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.830 
before the fuselage I had it all square
I'm<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.400> gonna<00:00:26.550> back<00:00:26.759> back<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.599> went

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
I'm not gonna back back here it went

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
I'm not gonna back back here it went
straight<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:28.710> went<00:00:28.890> across<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
straight up and then went across and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
straight up and then went across and
went<00:00:29.519> straight<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:29.929> I<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> keep

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
went straight now I was going to keep

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.940 
went straight now I was going to keep
like<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.780> but<00:00:33.780> uh<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.140> figured<00:00:34.590> it'd<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
like that but uh I figured it'd be you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.020 
like that but uh I figured it'd be you
know<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:35.250> ahead<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> cut<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> put<00:00:35.910> an

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
know go ahead and cut it and put an

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.450 
know go ahead and cut it and put an
angle<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:37.200> give<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.590> practice<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.129> how

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
angle will give me some practice on how

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.160 
angle will give me some practice on how
I<00:00:38.789> would<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:39.360> ahead<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.539> do<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> real<00:00:39.960> one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I would go ahead and do the real one

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.360 
I would go ahead and do the real one
what<00:00:40.739> angle<00:00:41.010> worked<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> best<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:43.370> gotta

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
what angle worked out the best I gotta

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
what angle worked out the best I gotta
figure<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.789> though<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.660> too

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
figure it out though it's not one too

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
figure it out though it's not one too
bad<00:00:46.129> let's<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.699> in<00:00:47.760> the

bad let's see like right here in the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.810 
bad let's see like right here in the
front<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.820> flush

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
front see I'm not it's not really flush

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you know I got a little bit of a gap

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
you know I got a little bit of a gap
there<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.410> okay<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.550> wanted<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120

there that's okay I just wanted just to
get<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> shape<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> general<00:00:55.050> shape<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.910> give

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
get the shape the general shape and give

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.959 
get the shape the general shape and give
it<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> shot<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> goes<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.020> there

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
it a shot and see how it goes from there

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.230 
it a shot and see how it goes from there
but<00:00:59.969> um<00:01:00.120> also<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> wings<00:01:01.530> done<00:01:05.240> if

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
ran a carbon fiber rod through it and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.630 
ran a carbon fiber rod through it and
then<00:01:19.530> went<00:01:19.770> come<00:01:20.010> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> back<00:01:20.370> here<00:01:20.610> to

these two pieces right here is actually
uh<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:25.850> two<00:01:26.850> since<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.300> couldn't<00:01:27.480> find<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
uh a two since I couldn't find it to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
uh a two since I couldn't find it to
that<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.260> at<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.500> time<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.160> had<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that big at the time and I had to have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.040 
that big at the time and I had to have
it<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.730> now<00:01:29.940> when<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.540> building<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.870> and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
it right now when I was building it and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.230 
it right now when I was building it and
I<00:01:31.080> went<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.320> wait<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> went<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.610> Walmart<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I went to wait so I went to Walmart and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.670 
I went to wait so I went to Walmart and
bought<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.760> carbon<00:01:35.760> fiber<00:01:36.000> arrows

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
bought one of those carbon fiber arrows

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.770 
bought one of those carbon fiber arrows
in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.920> sports<00:01:38.790> section<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.510> one<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.690> those

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
in the sports section got one of those

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.980 
in the sports section got one of those
cut<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> ran<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.780> little

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
cut it up and then I ran I'm a little

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.120 
cut it up and then I ran I'm a little
axial<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:46.260> go<00:01:46.380> through<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.860> was

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
axial through it you go through that was

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.440 
axial through it you go through that was
actually<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.400> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.640> smaller<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.240> did

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
actually a little bit smaller so I did

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.290 
actually a little bit smaller so I did
was<00:01:48.600> ran<00:01:49.190> put<00:01:50.190> some<00:01:50.310> electrical<00:01:50.940> tape<00:01:50.970> around

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
was ran put some electrical tape around

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.720 
was ran put some electrical tape around
it<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.740> kept<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.190> know<00:01:53.310> rolling<00:01:53.520> up

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
it to and kept you know rolling up

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.970 
it to and kept you know rolling up
around<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.390> diameter<00:01:54.600> bigger<00:01:55.020> then

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
around to get the diameter bigger then

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.590 
around to get the diameter bigger then
once<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.220> got<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.580> size<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.000> put<00:01:57.030> heat<00:01:57.330> shrink

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
once I got to a size I put heat shrink

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
once I got to a size I put heat shrink
over<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> shrunk<00:01:58.230> it<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.700> made<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.910> for<00:02:00.150> the

over it shrunk it and I made it for the
gap<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.690> know<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.050> distance<00:02:01.650> inside<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
gap you know the distance inside of it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.380 
got the motor it'll actually hide the
whole<00:04:39.190> stuff<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:39.910> won't

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
whole stuff so you won't

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.390 
whole stuff so you won't
I<00:04:40.530> won't<00:04:41.530> really<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.190> what's<00:04:42.310> he

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
I won't really see it and what's he

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.470 
I won't really see it and what's he
looking<00:04:42.850> between<00:04:43.150> there<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:45.180> by<00:04:46.180> looking<00:04:46.390> at

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
looking between there and by looking at

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.450 
looking between there and by looking at
my<00:04:46.570> son's<00:04:46.810> toy<00:04:47.050> it's<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.919> same<00:04:48.100> it's<00:04:48.340> got<00:04:48.430> a

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
my son's toy it's the same it's got a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.800 
my son's toy it's the same it's got a
hole<00:04:48.669> there<00:04:48.850> but<00:04:48.880> once<00:04:49.180> everything<00:04:49.540> is<00:04:49.570> all

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
hole there but once everything is all

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.500 
hole there but once everything is all
there<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:51.220> know<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.550> covers<00:04:52.060> up<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.240> pretty

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
there you know and it covers up a pretty

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.720 
there you know and it covers up a pretty
good<00:04:52.630> bit<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.860> same<00:04:54.220> thing<00:04:54.250> for<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.610> bottom

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
good bit and same thing for the bottom

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.640 
good bit and same thing for the bottom
top<00:04:55.090> down<00:04:55.480> here<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.780> bottom<00:04:55.930> same<00:04:56.230> think<00:04:56.500> I

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
top down here in the bottom same think I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.750 
top down here in the bottom same think I
was<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.830> hole<00:04:57.070> pretty<00:04:57.250> good<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.520> was<00:05:00.520> worried

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
was a hole pretty good so I was worried

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.440 
was a hole pretty good so I was worried
about<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.090> mean<00:05:01.330> that's

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
about that I mean that's

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.780 
about that I mean that's
terrible-looking<00:05:01.780> but<00:05:02.140> it'll<00:05:02.950> go<00:05:03.460> right<00:05:03.580> once

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
terrible-looking but it'll go right once

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.640 
terrible-looking but it'll go right once
everything's<00:05:04.090> built<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:06.060> that's<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.240> with<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
everything's built up that's it with the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.750 
everything's built up that's it with the
other<00:05:08.650> wings<00:05:09.660> open<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.780> closed<00:05:11.610> worked<00:05:12.610> out

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
other wings open and closed worked out

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.430 
other wings open and closed worked out
good<00:05:12.940> took<00:05:13.180> me<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.540> minute<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:14.050> figure<00:05:14.229> out<00:05:14.380> how

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
good took me a minute to figure out how

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.659 
good took me a minute to figure out how
to<00:05:14.470> do<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.800> but<00:05:14.919> this<00:05:15.040> worked<00:05:15.250> out<00:05:15.400> pretty<00:05:15.550> good

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
to do it but this worked out pretty good

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.730 
to do it but this worked out pretty good
I<00:05:15.820> think<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:17.050> thing<00:05:17.229> I'm<00:05:17.320> going<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.470> stick

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
I think the thing I'm going to stick

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.300 
I think the thing I'm going to stick
with<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.919> same<00:05:18.100> idea<00:05:18.460> on<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:18.910> other<00:05:19.030> one<00:05:20.070> and

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.760 

I'm<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.430> light<00:05:24.610> next<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> TIE<00:05:25.150> fighter

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
I'm a light next to a TIE fighter

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:36.210 
I'm a light next to a TIE fighter
interceptor<00:05:26.770> get<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.700> size<00:05:27.970> comparison<00:05:35.220> here's

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
interceptor get a size comparison here's

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:52.269 
interceptor get a size comparison here's
the<00:05:36.370> other<00:05:36.430> one<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:38.020> Interceptor

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.589 

explain<00:05:53.279> how<00:05:53.399> one<00:05:53.550> looks<00:05:53.669> bigger<00:05:53.969> depending

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
explain how one looks bigger depending

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:01.159 
explain how one looks bigger depending
on<00:05:54.839> the<00:05:54.959> camera<00:05:55.229> angle<00:05:59.659> now<00:06:00.659> the<00:06:00.719> ex<00:06:00.869> Phoenix

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
on the camera angle now the ex Phoenix

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.109 
on the camera angle now the ex Phoenix
bigger<00:06:01.369> but<00:06:02.369> yeah<00:06:02.459> I<00:06:02.489> think<00:06:02.669> I<00:06:02.789> need<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:02.999> make

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:03.119 
bigger but yeah I think I need to make

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:04.879 
bigger but yeah I think I need to make
it<00:06:03.209> bigger<00:06:03.330> it's<00:06:03.749> not<00:06:03.989> quite<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.349> same<00:06:04.499> scale

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
it bigger it's not quite the same scale

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.139 
it bigger it's not quite the same scale
I<00:06:05.099> don't<00:06:05.249> know<00:06:05.309> suit<00:06:06.029> you<00:06:06.149> guys<00:06:06.300> thank<00:06:06.599> you

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:11.149 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.100 

yeah<00:06:12.149> it's<00:06:12.330> got<00:06:12.449> to<00:06:12.479> be<00:06:12.599> bigger

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
yeah it's got to be bigger

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.019 
yeah it's got to be bigger
I<00:06:13.139> think<00:06:13.529> this<00:06:13.769> my<00:06:13.979> fuselage<00:06:14.519> has<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:14.879> be

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
I think this my fuselage has to be

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.570 
I think this my fuselage has to be
somewhere<00:06:15.559> maybe<00:06:16.559> a<00:06:16.679> little<00:06:16.800> bit<00:06:16.979> close<00:06:17.309> to

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
somewhere maybe a little bit close to

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.790 
somewhere maybe a little bit close to
the<00:06:17.729> diamond<00:06:18.389> of<00:06:18.449> the<00:06:18.539> cockpit<00:06:18.959> on<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.439> on<00:06:19.679> the

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
the diamond of the cockpit on the on the

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.579 
the diamond of the cockpit on the on the
tie<00:06:19.979> I<00:06:20.689> think<00:06:21.689> for<00:06:21.839> this<00:06:21.929> scale<00:06:22.199> to<00:06:22.229> be<00:06:22.349> right

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
tie I think for this scale to be right

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:28.359 
tie I think for this scale to be right
on<00:06:22.769> them<00:06:24.079> I<00:06:25.729> don't<00:06:26.729> know<00:06:26.849> I<00:06:26.909> figured<00:06:27.329> out<00:06:27.449> later

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:28.369 
on them I don't know I figured out later

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:31.339 
on them I don't know I figured out later
but<00:06:29.369> anyway<00:06:29.749> what<00:06:30.749> I'm<00:06:30.839> saying<00:06:31.019> earlier<00:06:31.259> this

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
but anyway what I'm saying earlier this

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.600 
but anyway what I'm saying earlier this
is<00:06:31.469> just<00:06:31.589> my<00:06:31.679> test<00:06:31.860> while<00:06:32.129> I'm<00:06:32.279> plugging<00:06:32.489> a

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
is just my test while I'm plugging a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.239 
is just my test while I'm plugging a
crashes<00:06:32.969> few<00:06:33.149> times<00:06:33.389> so<00:06:33.599> it's<00:06:34.559> not<00:06:34.739> real<00:06:35.009> clean

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
crashes few times so it's not real clean

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.459 
crashes few times so it's not real clean
or<00:06:35.429> fancy<00:06:35.759> nothing<00:06:35.939> it's<00:06:36.179> just<00:06:36.379> getting<00:06:37.379> the

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
or fancy nothing it's just getting the

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.989 
or fancy nothing it's just getting the
shape<00:06:37.709> messing<00:06:38.129> around<00:06:38.219> with<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.699> cutting

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:38.999 
shape messing around with it cutting

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.699 
shape messing around with it cutting
angles<00:06:39.329> trying<00:06:39.809> to<00:06:39.869> get<00:06:39.989> used<00:06:40.229> to<00:06:40.349> it<00:06:40.469> get<00:06:40.589> some

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:40.709 
angles trying to get used to it get some

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.709 
angles trying to get used to it get some
practice<00:06:41.069> in<00:06:41.159> it<00:06:41.309> and<00:06:41.539> figure<00:06:42.539> out<00:06:42.569> what's

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
practice in it and figure out what's

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:43.909 
practice in it and figure out what's
going<00:06:42.749> to<00:06:42.899> work<00:06:43.079> on<00:06:43.259> what<00:06:43.379> doesn't<00:06:43.679> someone<00:06:43.800> I

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
going to work on what doesn't someone I

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.899 
going to work on what doesn't someone I
got<00:06:44.009> to<00:06:44.129> make<00:06:44.219> my<00:06:44.339> bigger<00:06:44.550> one

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.689 

well<00:06:47.909> that's<00:06:48.059> it<00:06:48.269> for<00:06:48.479> those<00:06:49.339> awful<00:06:50.339> here's<00:06:50.550> to
