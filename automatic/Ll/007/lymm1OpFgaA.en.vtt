00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
gotten to the point where sometimes I'm

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.880 
gotten to the point where sometimes I'm
reading<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> book<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.750> like

uncomfortable to hold the book which is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
uncomfortable to hold the book which is
ridiculous<00:01:28.110> secondly<00:01:28.710> though<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
ridiculous secondly though and this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.999 
ridiculous secondly though and this
funny<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.360> important<00:01:30.780> point

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
funny of kind of a more important point

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
funny of kind of a more important point
