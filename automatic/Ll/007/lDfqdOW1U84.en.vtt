00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
under some water but i'm not sure we

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.989 
under some water but i'm not sure we
good<00:04:54.199> in<00:04:54.439> America<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:55.069> know<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.610> England<00:04:55.729> they

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
good in America I know in England they

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.950 
good in America I know in England they
called<00:04:56.180> war<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.659> know<00:04:56.749> other<00:04:56.870> things

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
called war but you know other things

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.010 
called war but you know other things
that<00:04:57.199> just<00:04:57.409> drain<00:04:58.159> rainwater<00:04:58.909> off<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.689> just

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
that just drain rainwater off and just

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.799 
that just drain rainwater off and just
collect<00:05:00.169> up<00:05:00.499> to<00:05:00.559> stash<00:05:01.159> away<00:05:01.629> stirring<00:05:02.629> I

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:02.809 
collect up to stash away stirring I

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:03.959 
collect up to stash away stirring I
guess<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:03.169> we<00:05:03.259> can<00:05:03.409> just<00:05:03.499> use<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.830> for

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
guess so we can just use it for

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.219 
guess so we can just use it for
gardening<00:05:04.969> and<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.240> just<00:05:05.389> chucked<00:05:05.839> me<00:05:06.020> under

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229
