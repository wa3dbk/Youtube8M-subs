00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
clock tower was supposed to include the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.009 
clock tower was supposed to include the
lyrics<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.939> it's<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.299> small<00:03:09.569> world

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
but sadly due to copyright issues they

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.319 
but sadly due to copyright issues they
have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.680> remove<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.219> lyrics<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.819> use<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
have to remove the lyrics and use the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.740 
have to remove the lyrics and use the
freaky<00:03:15.750> instrumental<00:03:16.260> version<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.189> hear<00:03:17.489> now

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
freaky instrumental version you hear now

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.909 
freaky instrumental version you hear now
and<00:03:18.750> we're<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.319> would<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.680> with<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
and we're how it would be with the

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.980 
and we're how it would be with the
lyrics<00:03:20.459> though

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.990 

I<00:03:26.020> know<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.980> they<00:03:27.100> were<00:03:27.160> making<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.610> freakier

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
I know that they were making a freakier

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.150 
I know that they were making a freakier
version<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.570> song<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.290> think<00:03:29.710> with<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
version of the song but I think with the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.610 
version of the song but I think with the
lyrics<00:03:30.490> would<00:03:30.640> be<00:03:30.790> alone<00:03:31.300> too<00:03:31.840> much<00:03:31.870> don't<00:03:32.500> you

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
lyrics would be alone too much don't you

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.740 
lyrics would be alone too much don't you
think
