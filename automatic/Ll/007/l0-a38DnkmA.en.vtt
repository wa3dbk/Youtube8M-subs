sculpted<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:49.060> mold<00:03:49.570> suits<00:03:50.020> their<00:03:50.860> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
sculpted I think this mold suits their I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.390 
sculpted I think this mold suits their I
know<00:03:51.100> better<00:03:51.459> than<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:52.000> abominations<00:03:53.400> for

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
know better than the abominations for

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.130 
know better than the abominations for
some<00:03:54.580> reason<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.150> don't<00:03:55.300> know<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.390> like<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140

some reason I don't know I like the
abominations<00:03:56.739> but<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.920> think<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.430> mode<00:03:57.670> was

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
abominations but I think this mode was

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.910 
abominations but I think this mode was
better<00:03:58.180> suited<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:59.110> character<00:03:59.739> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
better suited for this character the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.060 
better suited for this character the
