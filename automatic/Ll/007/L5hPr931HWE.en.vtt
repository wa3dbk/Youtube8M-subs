more gain which is needed for microphone

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.679 
more gain which is needed for microphone
amplification<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> contour<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
amplification so we have the contour on

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.270 
amplification so we have the contour on
and<00:02:03.869> off<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.140> which<00:02:04.290> basically<00:02:04.649> gives<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and off here which basically gives you a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.069

make it sound a little bit fatter and a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.580 
make it sound a little bit fatter and a
little<00:02:11.700> bit<00:02:11.790> sweeter<00:02:12.090> great<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.110> play

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

somewhere if you can just stack and one

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.430 
somewhere if you can just stack and one
on<00:03:08.190> top<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.519> other<00:03:09.079> convenient<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.290> you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
on top of the other convenient for you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.559 
on top of the other convenient for you
know<00:03:10.530> small<00:03:10.799> parties<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.310> or<00:03:11.400> whatnot<00:03:11.579> so

know small parties to or whatnot so

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.180 
know small parties to or whatnot so
anyway<00:03:12.959> probably<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.379> big<00:03:13.500> question<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.040> how

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
anyway probably the big question so how

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.800 
anyway probably the big question so how
do<00:03:14.250> they<00:03:14.579> sound<00:03:14.849> Al<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.390> how<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.540> they<00:03:15.660> compare

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
do they sound Al and how do they compare

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.809 
do they sound Al and how do they compare
to<00:03:16.230> other<00:03:16.470> speakers<00:03:16.769> at<00:03:17.069> their<00:03:17.190> price<00:03:17.370> points

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
to other speakers at their price points

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.330 
to other speakers at their price points
or<00:03:17.970> even<00:03:18.000> above<00:03:18.630> their<00:03:18.780> price<00:03:18.989> point<00:03:19.340> well

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
variations you're gonna see between the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.330 
variations you're gonna see between the
lower<00:03:34.680> end<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> higher<00:03:35.280> end<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.900> often<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
lower end of the higher end is often the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.650 
lower end of the higher end is often the
not<00:03:38.340> only<00:03:38.549> little<00:03:38.760> frequency<00:03:39.060> response<00:03:39.510> or

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
not only little frequency response or

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.210 
not only little frequency response or
extension<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.260> low<00:03:40.349> frequency<00:03:40.769> response<00:03:40.859> but

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
extension of low frequency response but

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.150 
extension of low frequency response but
also<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.380> compression<00:03:43.380> driver<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> quality

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
also the compression driver the quality

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.099 
also the compression driver the quality
of<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.280> compression<00:03:44.700> driver<00:03:44.819> how<00:03:45.660> sweet<00:03:45.989> it

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
of the compression driver how sweet it

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.650 
of the compression driver how sweet it
is<00:03:46.139> how<00:03:46.560> crisp<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.790> how<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.120> know<00:03:48.480> how

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
is how crisp it is and how you know how

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.199 
is how crisp it is and how you know how
ear<00:03:48.900> friendly<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.799> whole<00:03:50.010> entire<00:03:50.549> speaker<00:03:51.060> is

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
ear friendly the whole entire speaker is

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.449 
ear friendly the whole entire speaker is
so<00:03:52.049> what<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.739> thing<00:03:52.889> I<00:03:52.980> noticed<00:03:53.340> when

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
so what that's one thing I noticed when

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.180 
so what that's one thing I noticed when
comparing<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.780> know<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.380> higher<00:03:55.560> end<00:03:55.859> or

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
comparing you know the the higher end or

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.289 
comparing you know the the higher end or
more<00:03:56.549> expensive<00:03:56.790> speakers<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.200> lower<00:03:58.889> end

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
more expensive speakers to the lower end

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.670 
more expensive speakers to the lower end
basically<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.319> know<00:04:01.410> they're<00:04:01.590> not

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
basically is the you know they're not

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.710 
basically is the you know they're not
gonna<00:04:01.859> sound<00:04:02.099> quite<00:04:02.579> as<00:04:02.730> sweet<00:04:02.880> then<00:04:03.630> I'm

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
gonna sound quite as sweet then I'm

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.420 
gonna sound quite as sweet then I'm
gonna<00:04:03.870> go<00:04:04.049> quite<00:04:04.410> as<00:04:04.590> low<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:04.980> another<00:04:05.220> thing

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
gonna go quite as low and another thing

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.229 
gonna go quite as low and another thing
with<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.639> sound<00:04:05.880> since<00:04:06.120> you're

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
with the sound since you're

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.000 
with the sound since you're
unfortunately<00:04:06.840> because<00:04:07.200> they're<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.500> compact

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
unfortunately because they're so compact

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.670 
unfortunately because they're so compact
and<00:04:08.250> lightweight<00:04:09.230> basically<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.349> smaller

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
and lightweight basically the smaller

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.500 
and lightweight basically the smaller
size<00:04:11.099> of<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.489> box<00:04:11.819> does<00:04:12.150> affect

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
size of the box does affect

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.960 
size of the box does affect
low-frequency<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.980> while<00:04:14.310> they<00:04:14.430> do<00:04:14.489> have<00:04:14.579> some

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
low-frequency so while they do have some

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.120 
low-frequency so while they do have some
bass<00:04:15.180> they<00:04:15.389> don't<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:16.109> quite<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:16.620> much<00:04:16.889> bass

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
bass they don't have quite as much bass

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.719 
bass they don't have quite as much bass
as<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> good<00:04:17.959> bigger<00:04:18.959> better<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.010> know<00:04:20.099> 15<00:04:20.519> inch

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
as a good bigger better you know 15 inch

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.039 
as a good bigger better you know 15 inch
but<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.209> we<00:04:21.359> can't<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:21.780> fault<00:04:21.989> them

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
but you know we can't really fault them

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.540 
but you know we can't really fault them
here<00:04:22.320> because<00:04:22.409> at<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.710> price<00:04:22.919> point<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.430> do

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
here because at the price point you do

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850 
here because at the price point you do
have<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.909> expect<00:04:24.870> certain<00:04:25.200> things<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.590> you

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
have to expect certain things that you

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.159 
have to expect certain things that you
can't<00:04:26.070> expect<00:04:26.340> them<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.520> perform<00:04:26.669> like

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
can't expect them to perform like

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.920 
can't expect them to perform like
dollars<00:04:28.039> speaker<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.999> will<00:04:29.150> Samson<00:04:29.689> a<00:04:29.719> break

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
dollars speaker so will Samson a break

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.209 
dollars speaker so will Samson a break
here<00:04:30.169> what<00:04:30.319> I<00:04:30.349> can<00:04:30.590> tell<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.949> that<00:04:30.979> they<00:04:31.159> do

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219 
here what I can tell you is that they do

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.040 
here what I can tell you is that they do
sound<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.639> lot<00:04:31.879> better<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.330> American<00:04:32.749> audio

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
sound a lot better the American audio

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.989 
sound a lot better the American audio
Els<00:04:33.409> 15a<00:04:33.919> as<00:04:34.069> I<00:04:34.159> reviewed<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.520> few<00:04:34.669> months<00:04:34.909> ago

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:34.999 
Els 15a as I reviewed a few months ago

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.600 
Els 15a as I reviewed a few months ago
and<00:04:35.569> compared<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.379> say<00:04:36.560> my<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.400> know<00:04:37.490> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and compared to say my you know the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.589 
and compared to say my you know the
Costco<00:04:37.939> Edison<00:04:38.509> M<00:04:38.810> mm<00:04:39.680> speaker<00:04:40.249> I<00:04:40.599> actually

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
Costco Edison M mm speaker I actually

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.300 
Costco Edison M mm speaker I actually
found<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.080> innocence<00:04:42.439> I'm<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:43.069> tad

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
found that innocence I'm just a tad

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.640 
found that innocence I'm just a tad
nicer<00:04:44.029> on<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.479> top<00:04:44.659> end<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:44.960> have<00:04:45.169> a<00:04:45.199> bit<00:04:45.439> more

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
nicer on the top end and have a bit more

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.860 
nicer on the top end and have a bit more
bass<00:04:45.860> but<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.729> know<00:04:46.819> for<00:04:47.300> most<00:04:47.389> people<00:04:47.509> that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
bass but you know for most people that

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.629 
bass but you know for most people that
probably<00:04:48.020> say<00:04:48.289> they're<00:04:48.439> comparable<00:04:48.919> what

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
probably say they're comparable what

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.980 
probably say they're comparable what
you're<00:04:49.789> lacking<00:04:50.120> if<00:04:50.419> you're<00:04:50.539> comparing<00:04:50.870> these

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
you're lacking if you're comparing these

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.159 
you're lacking if you're comparing these
to<00:04:51.199> say<00:04:51.379> my<00:04:51.879> the<00:04:52.879> XR<00:04:53.150> 15<00:04:53.539> s<00:04:53.689> down<00:04:53.840> there<00:04:54.050> which

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
to say my the XR 15 s down there which

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.629 
to say my the XR 15 s down there which
are<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:54.560> note<00:04:54.680> why<00:04:54.979> I've<00:04:55.099> more<00:04:55.310> than<00:04:55.340> twice

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
are you note why I've more than twice

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.399 
are you note why I've more than twice
the<00:04:55.789> price<00:04:55.999> if<00:04:56.419> you're<00:04:56.659> losing<00:04:56.779> some<00:04:57.169> of<00:04:57.199> the

losing some of the low end as well but

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.070 
losing some of the low end as well but
you<00:05:03.979> know<00:05:04.099> for<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.550> reduced<00:05:04.939> price<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.719> do<00:05:05.900> have

sound of the you know compression driver

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.809 
sound of the you know compression driver
the<00:06:12.289> amount<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.560> base<00:06:12.680> but<00:06:13.310> also<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.759> the

the amount of base but also in the

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
weight and size you know so basically go

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.829 
weight and size you know so basically go
test<00:06:16.460> them<00:06:16.610> out<00:06:16.699> that's<00:06:17.419> usually<00:06:17.719> the<00:06:17.750> best

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:17.839 
test them out that's usually the best

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.119 
test them out that's usually the best
way<00:06:17.930> to<00:06:18.020> determine<00:06:18.199> take<00:06:18.560> them<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.830> gig<00:06:19.009> if

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
way to determine take them to a gig if

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.829 
way to determine take them to a gig if
you<00:06:19.219> can<00:06:19.430> but<00:06:20.389> I<00:06:20.419> think<00:06:20.599> most<00:06:20.719> people
