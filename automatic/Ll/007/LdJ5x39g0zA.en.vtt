going<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.210> be<00:00:41.330> on<00:00:41.449> there<00:00:41.690> because<00:00:42.230> my<00:00:42.500> phone

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
going to be on there because my phone

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.140 
going to be on there because my phone
does<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.010> all<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.220> time<00:00:43.340> it'll<00:00:43.730> randomly

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
does that all the time it'll randomly

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.330 
does that all the time it'll randomly
just<00:00:44.390> restart<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:45.530> takes<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.770> couple<00:00:45.800> seconds

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
just restart just takes a couple seconds

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.240 
just restart just takes a couple seconds
but<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:46.640> randomly<00:00:47.120> does<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:47.510> all<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.690> time

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250

hundred percent sure it is I know for a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.859 
hundred percent sure it is I know for a
fact<00:01:25.729> they<00:01:26.060> said<00:01:26.210> they're<00:01:26.300> going<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.479> add<00:01:26.600> a

fact they said they're going to add a
better<00:01:27.289> battery<00:01:27.560> life<00:01:27.770> kind<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.340> an<00:01:28.520> energy

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
better battery life kind of an energy

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.200 
better battery life kind of an energy
saver<00:01:29.420> type<00:01:29.750> thing<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:31.760> we're<00:01:32.060> not

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
saver type thing to it but we're not

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.850 
saver type thing to it but we're not
completely<00:01:32.570> sure<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:32.810> when<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.320> expect<00:01:33.590> this

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
completely sure but when to expect this

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.850 
completely sure but when to expect this
jailbreak<00:01:34.220> with<00:01:34.549> their<00:01:34.820> thinking<00:01:35.210> maybe

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
jailbreak with their thinking maybe

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.410 
jailbreak with their thinking maybe
beginning<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.950> mid-january<00:01:37.430> few<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
beginning to mid-january few of the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.710 
beginning to mid-january few of the
jailbreakers<00:01:38.840> like<00:01:39.170> ionic<00:01:39.650> also<00:01:40.040> said

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
jailbreakers like ionic also said

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.210 
jailbreakers like ionic also said
expecting<00:01:41.720> an<00:01:41.840> end<00:01:42.049> of<00:01:42.229> 2012<00:01:42.770> beginning<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
expecting an end of 2012 beginning of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.890 
expecting an end of 2012 beginning of
2013<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.659> when<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.900> does<00:01:45.140> come<00:01:45.380> out<00:01:46.720> go<00:01:47.720> ahead

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
2013 so when that does come out go ahead

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.179 
2013 so when that does come out go ahead
and<00:01:48.049> update<00:01:48.200> or<00:01:48.470> probably<00:01:48.920> go<00:01:49.040> ahead<00:01:49.100> and

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
and update or probably go ahead and

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.830 
and update or probably go ahead and
update<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.790> they're<00:01:50.450> saying<00:01:50.689> that's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
update to that they're saying that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.289 
update to that they're saying that's
going<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.229> probably<00:01:51.560> their<00:01:51.680> most<00:01:51.710> ideal

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
going to be probably their most ideal
