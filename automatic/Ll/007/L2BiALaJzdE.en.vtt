so that you have nice significant layers

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080 
so that you have nice significant layers
as<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.619> started<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.400> just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
can see I have different layers here and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140 
can see I have different layers here and
when<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> poured<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> cup<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
poured it into different directions so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.569 
poured it into different directions so
you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:34.920> types<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.340> layers

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you have different types of layers

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.910 
you have different types of layers
different<00:01:36.150> thicknesses<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.799> you're

you can give them some gloves as well

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.050 
you can give them some gloves as well
although<00:02:48.050> while<00:02:48.620> they're<00:02:48.890> doing<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.550> they

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
although while they're doing this they

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.970 
although while they're doing this they
the<00:02:50.600> glove<00:02:50.840> might<00:02:51.110> end<00:02:51.319> up<00:02:51.440> getting<00:02:51.739> caught

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the glove might end up getting caught

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.580 
the glove might end up getting caught
between<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.700> salt<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> chalk<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
between the salt and the chalk so you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.840 
between the salt and the chalk so you
might<00:02:54.769> want<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.190> let<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.459> loose<00:02:55.670> their

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
might want to just let them loose their

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.210 
might want to just let them loose their
hand<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.440> big<00:02:57.680> pieces<00:02:57.920> of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.120 
hand and if you have the big pieces of
cloth<00:02:58.519> then<00:02:59.450> it<00:03:00.290> shouldn't<00:03:00.650> be<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.829> big<00:03:01.100> deal

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
cloth then it shouldn't be a big deal

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.400 
cloth then it shouldn't be a big deal
once<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.940> big<00:03:02.269> piece<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.510> chalk<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.079> small

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
once the big piece of chalk it's small

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.930 
once the big piece of chalk it's small
you<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.799> always<00:03:03.950> give<00:03:04.220> them<00:03:04.310> another<00:03:04.610> piece

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.080 
here you can take a wooden skewer and
just<00:04:06.090> basically<00:04:06.569> poke<00:04:07.049> down<00:04:07.500> into<00:04:08.220> your

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
just basically poke down into your

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.800 
just basically poke down into your
project<00:04:10.340> now<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.400> see<00:04:11.609> what<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:11.790> does<00:04:12.180> it

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
project now you see what that does it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.779 
project now you see what that does it
gives<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.500> little<00:04:14.159> more<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:16.100> guess<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.549> just

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
gives it a little more I guess it just

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.340 
gives it a little more I guess it just
makes<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> look<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.299> lot<00:04:18.419> more<00:04:18.479> interesting<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
makes it look a lot more interesting it

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.740 
makes it look a lot more interesting it
pushes<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.160> top<00:04:20.579> colors<00:04:21.060> towards<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.600> bottom

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
pushes the top colors towards the bottom

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.000 
pushes the top colors towards the bottom
so<00:04:23.270> here<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.600> see<00:04:24.930> I've<00:04:25.139> got<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> purple

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
so here you can see I've got the purple

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.469 
so here you can see I've got the purple
on<00:04:26.099> top<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.550> then<00:04:26.639> I've<00:04:26.729> got<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> yellow<00:04:27.210> but

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
on top and then I've got the yellow but

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.500 
on top and then I've got the yellow but
I<00:04:27.510> pushed<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.990> purple<00:04:28.470> through<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.130> yellow

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
I pushed the purple through the yellow

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.170 
I pushed the purple through the yellow
and<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:31.380> just<00:04:31.590> adds<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.919> lot<00:04:32.130> more<00:04:32.190> another
