added<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.340> my<00:01:32.490> leagues<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:33.180> trade<00:01:33.689> or

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
added for my leagues was trade or

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630 
added for my leagues was trade or
lodging<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.520> things

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
lodging that was one of the first things

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.600 
lodging that was one of the first things
I<00:01:35.939> saw<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> saw<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:38.009> excited

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so maybe there will be some options

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.569 
so maybe there will be some options
where<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.770> first<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.490> a

where you know what first off it's a
normal<00:01:41.790> trade<00:01:42.119> logic<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> NBA

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
normal trade logic just like the NBA

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
normal trade logic just like the NBA
it's<00:01:43.979> realistic<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.509> many<00:01:45.659> blockbuster

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's realistic not so many blockbuster

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.170 
it's realistic not so many blockbuster
trades<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.220> still<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.610> some<00:01:47.640> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
trades they will still be some it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
trades they will still be some it's
gonna<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.720> fairly<00:01:49.020> even<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> trains

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
gonna be fairly even with the trains

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
gonna be fairly even with the trains
there<00:01:50.790> might<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> stricter<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> logic<00:01:52.290> where

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there might be a stricter a logic where

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
there might be a stricter a logic where
it's<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> much<00:01:52.740> bigger<00:01:52.920> challenge<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.939> might

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's a much bigger challenge there might

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
it's a much bigger challenge there might
be<00:01:54.180> an<00:01:54.360> easier<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> people<00:01:55.619> who<00:01:55.649> are

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
be an easier one for the people who are

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
be an easier one for the people who are
not<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.280> good<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.790> GM<00:01:57.149> mode<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.899> might<00:01:58.229> be

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
not as good as my GM mode there might be

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
not as good as my GM mode there might be
those<00:01:58.649> options<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.759> they<00:01:59.939> said<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
those options because what they said is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
those options because what they said is
they<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> more<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.740> sandbox

five<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.819> random<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:13.599> inconsistent

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
five it's so random it's so inconsistent

five it's so random it's so inconsistent
so<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:15.040> isn't<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.489> biggest<00:04:15.700> port<00:04:16.120> but<00:04:16.599> hey

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
so this isn't the biggest port but hey

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.750 
so this isn't the biggest port but hey
it<00:04:16.989> could<00:04:17.229> just<00:04:17.410> add<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.160> depth<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.609> the

it could just add to the depth of the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.210 
it could just add to the depth of the
