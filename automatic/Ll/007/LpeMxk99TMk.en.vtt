then comes the removable you know the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
then comes the removable you know the
movable<00:01:57.450> drives<00:01:57.720> again<00:01:58.650> these<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> their

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
movable drives again these have their

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
movable drives again these have their
own<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.159> caddies<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.640> slide<00:01:59.850> out<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
own little caddies that slide out it is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
own little caddies that slide out it is
fully<00:02:01.290> backplane<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.250> worry<00:02:02.400> about

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
fully backplane so you don't worry about

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.700 
fully backplane so you don't worry about
plugging<00:02:02.729> anything<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.869> far<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.200> power<00:02:04.439> or

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
plugging anything in as far as power or

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.710 
plugging anything in as far as power or
SATA<00:02:04.950> connectors<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.400> they<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.729> work<00:02:05.970> just

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
SATA connectors go they will work just

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.389 
SATA connectors go they will work just
by<00:02:06.869> sliding<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:08.159> very

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
by sliding them in so that's very very

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.029 
by sliding them in so that's very very
cool<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:09.689> moving<00:02:10.289> along<00:02:10.409> to<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> back<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
cool now moving along to the back of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.289 
cool now moving along to the back of
this<00:02:11.099> thing<00:02:11.159> I'll<00:02:11.610> show<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.939> what<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> got

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
this thing I'll show you what you got

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.830 
this thing I'll show you what you got
back<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.049> lot<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.980> good<00:02:14.069> stuff<00:02:14.840> starting

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
back here a lot of good stuff starting

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.239 
back here a lot of good stuff starting
off<00:02:15.930> at<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.019> top<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.099> any

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
off at the top don't have any

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.619 
off at the top don't have any
specifications<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.999> power<00:02:18.150> supply<00:02:18.419> but

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
specifications for the power supply but

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.569 
specifications for the power supply but
I'm<00:02:18.749> assuming<00:02:19.109> it<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.379> quite<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.219> large<00:02:20.430> one

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
I'm assuming it is quite a large one

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.590 
I'm assuming it is quite a large one
probably<00:02:20.879> over<00:02:21.120> 550<00:02:21.659> watts<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
probably over 550 watts because it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.540 
probably over 550 watts because it
have<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.810> fifty-fifty<00:02:23.260> graphics<00:02:23.620> card<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
have a fifty-fifty graphics card you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.030 
have a fifty-fifty graphics card you
also<00:02:24.760> have<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:26.550> ps2<00:02:27.550> s<00:02:27.820> for<00:02:28.240> keyboard<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.780> mouse

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
also have a ps2 s for keyboard and mouse

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.200 
also have a ps2 s for keyboard and mouse
HDMI<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.070> VGA<00:02:30.160> ports<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:30.700> blocked<00:02:31.030> off

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
HDMI and VGA ports are blocked off

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.970 
HDMI and VGA ports are blocked off
because<00:02:31.390> again<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:31.960> using<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.260> 58-54

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
because again you are using that 58-54

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.470 
because again you are using that 58-54
graphics<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:33.550> has<00:02:33.670> more<00:02:34.180> than<00:02:34.360> enough

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
graphics and that has more than enough

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.670 
graphics and that has more than enough
connectivity<00:02:35.080> which<00:02:35.200> we'll<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.410> into<00:02:35.470> in

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
connectivity which we'll get into in

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.730 
connectivity which we'll get into in

as an SP DIF and then down here this is
where<00:02:48.430> things<00:02:48.580> get<00:02:48.730> really<00:02:48.790> interesting<00:02:49.480> you

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
where things get really interesting you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.950 
where things get really interesting you
have<00:02:50.170> dual<00:02:50.470> DVIs<00:02:50.980> dual<00:02:51.550> link<00:02:51.730> DVIs<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.720> have

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
have dual DVIs dual link DVIs you have

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.020 
have dual DVIs dual link DVIs you have
HDMI<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.400> top<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.670> you

HDMI out and then on top of that you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.510 
HDMI out and then on top of that you
have<00:02:55.150> DisplayPort<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> 5850<00:02:57.310> it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
have DisplayPort so this is the 5850 it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.180 
have DisplayPort so this is the 5850 it
will<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.330> x11<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:59.050> will<00:02:59.320> do<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.620> Eyefinity

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
will do the x11 it will do the Eyefinity

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.790 
will do the x11 it will do the Eyefinity
system<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.030> very<00:03:01.360> very<00:03:02.080> very<00:03:02.230> nice<00:03:02.470> also
