a<00:02:42.130> SATA<00:02:43.130> hard<00:02:43.520> drive<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:44.000> standard<00:02:44.210> looking<00:02:44.630> 2.5

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
a SATA hard drive a standard looking 2.5

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.060 
a SATA hard drive a standard looking 2.5
inches<00:02:46.910> SATA<00:02:47.690> hard<00:02:47.900> drive<00:02:48.140> these<00:02:48.560> screws<00:02:48.920> that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
inches SATA hard drive these screws that

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:59.420 
inches SATA hard drive these screws that
you<00:02:49.130> have<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.370> remove<00:02:49.640> now
