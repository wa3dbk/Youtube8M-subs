00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.440 
you can see has an aluminum chassis
brace<00:02:42.580> top<00:02:43.120> plate<00:02:44.610> has<00:02:46.799> aluminum<00:02:48.000> cap<00:02:49.000> shocks

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
brace top plate has aluminum cap shocks

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.430 
brace top plate has aluminum cap shocks
plastic<00:02:50.380> shocks<00:02:50.680> oil<00:02:51.610> filled<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.200> can

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
plastic shocks oil filled so you can

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.240 
plastic shocks oil filled so you can
adjust<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.069> oil<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:55.590> improved<00:02:56.590> handling<00:02:56.829> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
adjust the oil for improved handling and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.699 
adjust the oil for improved handling and
your<00:02:57.370> shocks<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:58.480> threaded<00:02:58.959> those<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.590> would

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
your shocks not threaded those you would

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.300 
your shocks not threaded those you would
have<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.099> use<00:03:00.420> pre-loaded<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:03.400> adjust<00:03:04.329> that

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
have to use pre-loaded to adjust that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.099 
have to use pre-loaded to adjust that
one<00:03:06.310> thing<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.640> will<00:03:06.819> say<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.569> on/off

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
one thing I will say is the on/off

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.099 
one thing I will say is the on/off
switch<00:03:08.140> here<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.790> ESC<00:03:10.180> has<00:03:10.209> broken<00:03:10.780> off

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
switch here on the ESC has broken off

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.470 
switch here on the ESC has broken off
you<00:03:11.829> can<00:03:12.010> either<00:03:12.160> be<00:03:12.430> bit<00:03:12.579> on<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.819> opposition

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
you can either be bit on the opposition

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.949 
you can either be bit on the opposition
or<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.780> use<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.350> body<00:03:14.920> clip<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.760> flip<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.810> over

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
or I use a body clip and flip it over

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.539 
or I use a body clip and flip it over
that's<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.739> only<00:03:17.859> thing<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.250> really<00:03:18.340> ever

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
that's the only thing I can really ever

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.170 
that's the only thing I can really ever
say<00:03:18.850> went<00:03:19.090> wrong<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.510> car<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.730> also

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
say went wrong for this car I also

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.910 
say went wrong for this car I also
notice<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:24.450> shock<00:03:25.450> towers<00:03:25.870> are<00:03:26.260> aluminum

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
notice that shock towers are aluminum

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.809 
notice that shock towers are aluminum
front<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.639> back<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.500> also<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:30.190> suspension

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
front and back and also the suspension

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.440 
front and back and also the suspension
pin<00:03:31.239> holders<00:03:31.690> are<00:03:32.620> also<00:03:33.130> aluminum<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:33.910> these

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
pin holders are also aluminum so these

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.470 
pin holders are also aluminum so these
are<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> lot<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.870> features<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:36.220> would<00:03:36.480> wouldn't

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
are a lot of features you would wouldn't

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.740 
are a lot of features you would wouldn't
find<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:37.930> most<00:03:38.109> RTR<00:03:39.010> vehicles<00:03:39.639> so<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.540> thing

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
find in most RTR vehicles so this thing

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.270 
find in most RTR vehicles so this thing
is<00:03:40.959> very<00:03:42.000> very<00:03:43.000> durable<00:03:43.269> off<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.870> top<00:03:44.109> I<00:03:44.500> don't

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
is very very durable off the top I don't

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.190 
is very very durable off the top I don't
see<00:03:45.579> any<00:03:46.329> reason<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.230> be<00:03:47.739> able<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.220> want<00:03:48.459> to

it<00:03:52.960> also<00:03:53.110> has<00:03:53.530> adjustable<00:03:53.710> tone<00:03:54.400> camber<00:03:55.120> here

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it also has adjustable tone camber here

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090 
it also has adjustable tone camber here
so<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.890> adjust<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:58.320> way<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.380> wheels<00:03:59.620> set
