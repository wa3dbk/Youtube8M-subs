00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.720
 after the vote on television 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.720
 in seven minutes 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 now 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 by 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 recommended 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.990
 next to the brain 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.250
 to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 X 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.360
 then with the IT specialist 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.080
 of the two problems 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.870
 The first problem was what made itself and we solved it ourselves 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.940
 the second problem is the financing, because such an operation costs a lot 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 how do you think 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.320
 then you automatically end up at the bank 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 we are reasonable 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.230
 I mean that 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.340
 Yes and no 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.340

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.640
 you have 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.550
 Every day schools are going with Kyra to see the largest 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.120
 drug cartels 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.500
 so 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.570
 that works better than soap and water it's an active way that if you do 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.570
 stimulates the money for it 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.710
 wash your face with finances 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 dirt particles increased and practical 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.190
 The shooter's financial condition was the he gave 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.290
 child and what 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.939

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.439

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.439

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.489
 help transports the born pole that is needed and it doesn't matter 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.219
