yeah<00:00:04.799> let's<00:00:05.009> take<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> look<00:00:05.580> at<00:00:05.930> Elavon<00:00:06.930> mixing

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
yeah let's take a look at Elavon mixing

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.660 
yeah let's take a look at Elavon mixing
for<00:00:08.250> ER<00:00:08.519> 9x<00:00:09.440> and<00:00:10.440> first<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.889> quick<00:00:11.160> review<00:00:11.610> of

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
for ER 9x and first a quick review of

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.330 
for ER 9x and first a quick review of
what<00:00:11.849> Ella<00:00:12.330> Vaughn's<00:00:12.660> do<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.679> two

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
what Ella Vaughn's do you have two

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.269 
what Ella Vaughn's do you have two
control<00:00:14.820> surfaces<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.780> mixed<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
control surfaces that are mixed so that

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.590 
control surfaces that are mixed so that
your<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.670> down<00:00:20.760> left<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
your so that your up and down left and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720 
your so that your up and down left and
right<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:22.080> those<00:00:22.260> motions<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.949> translated

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
right all those motions are translated

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.670 
right all those motions are translated
onto<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> two<00:00:24.570> control<00:00:24.930> surfaces<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
onto just the two control surfaces I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.290 
onto just the two control surfaces I
have<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> link<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.390> couple<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> other<00:00:29.300> posts

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
have a link to a couple of other posts

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
have a link to a couple of other posts
and<00:00:30.420> videos<00:00:30.750> where<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.170> kind<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.470> cover<00:00:31.710> what

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and videos where we kind of cover what

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
and videos where we kind of cover what
that<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.480> let's<00:00:34.370> okay<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.820> notice

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that is but let's okay first off notice

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that is but let's okay first off notice
as<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.380> anything<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:38.989> mixing<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
as when we do anything with mixing be

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
as when we do anything with mixing be
sure<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:40.890> prop<00:00:41.309> off<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.000> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sure to take your prop off it's really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
sure to take your prop off it's really
easy<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> accidentally<00:00:43.410> set<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.860> prop

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
easy to accidentally set your prop

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
easy to accidentally set your prop
spinning<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.329> makes<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.899> an

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
spinning and that makes for an

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
spinning and that makes for an
uninteresting<00:00:48.500> experience<00:00:50.030> now<00:00:51.030> we've<00:00:51.180> got

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
uninteresting experience now we've got

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.580 
uninteresting experience now we've got
two<00:00:52.789> servos<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.899> connected<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
two servos here they're connected to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
two servos here they're connected to
channel<00:00:55.949> 2<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> Channel<00:00:57.210> 3<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
channel 2 and Channel 3 on the right and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
channel 2 and Channel 3 on the right and
left<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> those<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> linkage<00:01:03.049> back<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
left and those have a linkage back to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.330 
left and those have a linkage back to
the<00:01:05.189> control<00:01:05.580> surfaces<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.650> let's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the control surfaces here so first let's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.690 
the control surfaces here so first let's
do<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.270> elevator<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.340> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
do the elevator that's a little bit more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
do the elevator that's a little bit more
intuitive<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.840> we'll<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> first<00:01:13.760> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
intuitive so we'll do that first the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160 
intuitive so we'll do that first the
first<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.150> we're<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.960> we're

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:17.119> channel<00:01:18.119> 2<00:01:20.540> we're<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:23.479> mix

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
going to channel 2 we're going to mix

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
going to channel 2 we're going to mix
them<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.140> hundred<00:01:25.740> percent<00:01:26.090> elevator<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
them a hundred percent elevator and you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.700 
them a hundred percent elevator and you
can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:31.700> doing<00:01:32.840> pretty<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:34.020> what

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can see that is doing pretty much what

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
can see that is doing pretty much what
we<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.159> pull<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> stick<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.020> kind

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we want pull back on the stick it's kind

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
we want pull back on the stick it's kind
of<00:01:37.290> bring<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> plane<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:39.030> forward<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
of bring the plane up put forward on the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.219 
of bring the plane up put forward on the
stick<00:01:40.079> it'll<00:01:40.560> take<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> plane<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:42.229> now

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
stick it'll take the plane down now

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.039 
stick it'll take the plane down now
let's<00:01:43.590> jump<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
let's jump out and do that over on

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.090 
let's jump out and do that over on
channel<00:01:46.530> 3<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.280> well<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.770> say

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
channel 3 as well so we're gonna say

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.660 
channel 3 as well so we're gonna say
elevator<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.240> hundred<00:01:52.170> percent

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.840 

and<00:01:54.850> now<00:01:55.450> you'll<00:01:55.659> notice<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.409> not<00:01:56.950> what

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and now you'll notice this is not what

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.240 
and now you'll notice this is not what
we<00:01:58.030> want<00:01:58.330> we<00:01:58.810> want<00:01:58.840> both<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.380> these<00:01:59.620> pulling<00:02:00.070> up

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
we want we want both of these pulling up

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.920 
we want we want both of these pulling up
so<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.790> we're<00:02:00.940> gonna<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.570> we're<00:02:01.900> just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
so what we're gonna do is we're just

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.359 
so what we're gonna do is we're just
going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.290> change<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.800> weight<00:02:02.979> from<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
going to change the weight from a

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.930 
going to change the weight from a
hundred<00:02:03.700> percent<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.070> we're<00:02:06.490> gonna<00:02:06.640> bump

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
hundred percent and we're gonna bump

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.260 
hundred percent and we're gonna bump
that<00:02:07.180> down<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:10.630> -<00:02:11.020> 100<00:02:11.470> percent<00:02:12.270> pullback

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that down to - 100 percent pullback

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.070 
that down to - 100 percent pullback
plane<00:02:13.870> goes<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.410> push<00:02:15.370> forward<00:02:15.930> surfaces<00:02:16.930> go

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
plane goes up push forward surfaces go

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.140 
plane goes up push forward surfaces go
down<00:02:17.370> plane<00:02:18.370> goes<00:02:18.610> down<00:02:20.400> okay<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:21.610> what<00:02:21.970> we're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
down plane goes down okay now what we're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.800 
down plane goes down okay now what we're
gonna<00:02:22.270> do

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
gonna do

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.660 
gonna do
we've<00:02:23.140> got<00:02:23.410> no<00:02:25.170> left<00:02:26.170> or<00:02:26.319> right<00:02:26.380> motion<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
we've got no left or right motion on the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.970 
we've got no left or right motion on the
aileron<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> we're<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.600> mix<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.140> on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
aileron so we're going to mix in on

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.180 
aileron so we're going to mix in on
channel<00:02:33.910> two<00:02:34.060> first<00:02:34.510> we're<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.860> edit

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
channel two first we're going to edit

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.500 
channel two first we're going to edit
we're<00:02:36.790> going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.209> insert<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:38.070> mix<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.510> one

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
we're going to insert a mix and that one

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.560 
we're going to insert a mix and that one
we're<00:02:41.050> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.860> take<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.489> from<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.090> aileron

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
we're going to take it from the aileron

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.220 
we're going to take it from the aileron
and<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.280> also<00:02:45.670> gonna<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.090> either<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.870> plus

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
and this is also gonna be either a plus

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.380 
and this is also gonna be either a plus
or<00:02:47.500> minus<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:48.310> hundred<00:02:48.489> percent<00:02:48.820> would<00:02:49.269> you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
or minus a hundred percent would you

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.540 
or minus a hundred percent would you
basically<00:02:50.200> depending<00:02:50.709> on<00:02:50.800> how<00:02:50.950> your<00:02:51.130> servos

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
basically depending on how your servos

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.610 
basically depending on how your servos
are<00:02:51.760> installed<00:02:52.150> it'll<00:02:52.690> either<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.959> plus<00:02:53.350> or

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
are installed it'll either be plus or

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.670 
are installed it'll either be plus or
minus<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.600> just<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.110> kind<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.410> test

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
minus and you just have to kind of test

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.800 
minus and you just have to kind of test
it<00:02:56.800> out<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.100> see<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.489> works<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.970> now<00:02:58.750> we

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
it out and see what works for you now we

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.280 
it out and see what works for you now we
pull<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> right<00:02:59.820> now<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.880> right<00:03:01.290> should

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
pull to the right now the right should

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.449 
pull to the right now the right should
go<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.600> reversed<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.380> that's<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.220> bump

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
go up this is reversed so that's a bump

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:22.680 
go up this is reversed so that's a bump
that<00:03:06.519> down<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.660> minus<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:09.690> hundred<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:22.180> we<00:03:22.420> see

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
that down to minus a hundred and we see

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.560 
that down to minus a hundred and we see
push<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.350> stick<00:03:23.590> right<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.760> right<00:03:24.970> surface

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
push the stick right the right surface

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.039 
push the stick right the right surface
moves<00:03:25.959> up<00:03:26.350> push<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.370> stick<00:03:27.610> left<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.810> right

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
moves up push the stick left the right

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.000 
moves up push the stick left the right
surface<00:03:29.470> moves<00:03:30.130> down<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:32.079> test<00:03:32.380> out<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.739> mix

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
surface moves down we test out the mix

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
surface moves down we test out the mix
we<00:03:33.880> still<00:03:34.180> get<00:03:34.390> up<00:03:34.690> down<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:36.810> you'll<00:03:37.810> see<00:03:38.200> when

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
we still get up down now you'll see when

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.080 
we still get up down now you'll see when
we're<00:03:38.799> pushed<00:03:39.100> hard<00:03:39.610> left<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.980> we're<00:03:41.980> going

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
we're pushed hard left and we're going

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.090 
we're pushed hard left and we're going
up<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.329> down<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.930> elevator<00:03:44.380> we're

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
up and down with the elevator we're

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.729 
up and down with the elevator we're
getting<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.709> typical<00:03:48.489> Elavon<00:03:49.560> won't<00:03:50.560> cover

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
getting the typical Elavon won't cover

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.430 
getting the typical Elavon won't cover
the<00:03:50.920> in<00:03:51.070> detail<00:03:51.489> why<00:03:51.850> why<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.170> way<00:03:53.290> it

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
the in detail why why that is the way it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.069 
the in detail why why that is the way it
is<00:03:53.560> but<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:53.950> those<00:03:54.100> other<00:03:54.220> postings<00:03:54.760> I've

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
is but in those other postings I've

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.390 
is but in those other postings I've
gotten<00:03:56.079> notes<00:03:56.290> about<00:03:56.709> why<00:03:56.920> each<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
gotten notes about why each of the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.819 
gotten notes about why each of the
control<00:03:57.790> surfaces<00:03:58.329> does<00:03:58.989> what<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.380> does

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
control surfaces does what it does

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.650 
control surfaces does what it does
so<00:04:00.280> now<00:04:00.459> let's<00:04:01.980> jump<00:04:02.980> over<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.370> channel<00:04:03.849> 3<00:04:04.239> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
so now let's jump over to channel 3 the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.309 
so now let's jump over to channel 3 the
left<00:04:04.930> side<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:06.810> insert

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
left side and insert

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.179 
left side and insert
an<00:04:08.650> aileron<00:04:09.459> mix<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.599> let's<00:04:11.290> see<00:04:11.709> we<00:04:11.890> push

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
an aileron mix and let's see we push

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.390 
an aileron mix and let's see we push
that<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.849> left<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.890> needs<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.250> be

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
that to the left and it needs to be

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:28.310 
that to the left and it needs to be
reversed<00:04:15.760> because<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.630> should<00:04:17.079> be<00:04:17.259> going<00:04:17.590> up

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.659 

100<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.759> we<00:04:30.940> have<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.300> we<00:04:31.479> push<00:04:31.750> left

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
100 and there we have it we push left

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:42.230 
100 and there we have it we push left
right<00:04:34.169> forward<00:04:35.169> back<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:37.509> we<00:04:38.229> go<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:39.310> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.020 

different<00:04:43.240> corners<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.699> everything's<00:04:45.699> good

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
different corners and everything's good

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.850 
different corners and everything's good
now<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.630> one<00:04:46.930> thing<00:04:47.199> that's<00:04:47.500> going<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.680> be<00:04:47.830> a

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
now the one thing that's going to be a

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.330 
now the one thing that's going to be a
problem<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.699> for<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.449> super<00:04:49.750> fly<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.889> has<00:04:51.130> some

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
problem is for the super fly it has some

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.180 
problem is for the super fly it has some
recommended<00:04:52.000> throws<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.289> these<00:04:53.530> are<00:04:53.680> waiting

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
recommended throws and these are waiting

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.680 
recommended throws and these are waiting
like<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.699> just<00:04:54.849> like<00:04:55.000> super<00:04:55.330> over

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
like this is just like super over

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.290 
like this is just like super over
controlling<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.220> what<00:04:57.340> we're<00:04:57.490> gonna<00:04:57.639> do<00:04:57.970> is

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
controlling so what we're gonna do is

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.680 
controlling so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.759> change<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.949> weight<00:05:03.539> from<00:05:04.539> a

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
we're going to change the weight from a

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.960 
we're going to change the weight from a
hundred<00:05:05.160> will<00:05:06.160> do<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.520> channel<00:05:06.820> two

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
hundred will do this on channel two

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.230 
hundred will do this on channel two
first<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.449> you<00:05:07.539> can<00:05:07.720> see<00:05:08.070> we'll<00:05:09.070> say<00:05:09.310> edit<00:05:09.610> and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
first so you can see we'll say edit and

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.450 
first so you can see we'll say edit and
will<00:05:10.750> basically<00:05:10.990> change<00:05:11.289> everywhere<00:05:12.220> worth

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
will basically change everywhere worth

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.159 
will basically change everywhere worth
as<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.639> hundred<00:05:13.150> we're<00:05:13.479> just<00:05:13.659> going<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.900> change

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
as a hundred we're just going to change

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.120 
as a hundred we're just going to change
it<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.380> 50<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:16.810> add<00:05:17.080> experiment<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.800> earlier

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
it to 50 and I add experiment it earlier

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.089 
it to 50 and I add experiment it earlier
and<00:05:18.520> determine<00:05:19.060> that<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.240> was<00:05:19.510> about<00:05:19.750> right

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
and determine that that was about right

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:29.610 
and determine that that was about right
so<00:05:21.099> we<00:05:21.220> change<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.000> 50<00:05:27.720> have<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.930> change

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
so we change that to 50 have it change

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:39.180 
so we change that to 50 have it change
that<00:05:29.949> to<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.340> minus<00:05:30.820> 50<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:37.710> we'll<00:05:38.710> just<00:05:39.010> kind

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
that to a minus 50 and we'll just kind

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.430 
that to a minus 50 and we'll just kind
of<00:05:39.250> see<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.639> difference<00:05:40.030> Mac<00:05:40.419> you<00:05:40.990> can<00:05:41.169> see

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
of see the difference Mac you can see

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.529 
of see the difference Mac you can see
this<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:41.800> moving<00:05:42.010> much<00:05:42.400> laughing<00:05:42.820> see<00:05:43.210> this<00:05:43.389> is

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
this is moving much laughing see this is

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.610 
this is moving much laughing see this is
jumping<00:05:43.930> up<00:05:44.110> more<00:05:44.409> down<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.960> same<00:05:46.960> for<00:05:47.380> left

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
jumping up more down and same for left

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.270 
jumping up more down and same for left
and<00:05:47.830> right<00:05:47.949> motion<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.960> we<00:05:50.380> will<00:05:50.590> change<00:05:50.919> that

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
and right motion so we will change that

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:08.950 
and right motion so we will change that
for<00:05:53.760> Channel<00:05:54.760> three

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:23.659 

and<00:06:10.999> change<00:06:11.999> it<00:06:12.180> over<00:06:12.809> on<00:06:13.110> mix<00:06:21.469> and<00:06:22.469> now<00:06:23.279> we<00:06:23.339> can

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
and change it over on mix and now we can

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:31.059 
and change it over on mix and now we can
see<00:06:24.050> there's<00:06:25.939> the<00:06:26.939> recommended<00:06:27.830> motions<00:06:28.939> for

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069 
see there's the recommended motions for

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.010 
see there's the recommended motions for
for<00:06:32.069> the<00:06:32.189> superfly<00:06:32.759> anyways<00:06:33.629> it's<00:06:33.809> pretty

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
for the superfly anyways it's pretty

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.049 
for the superfly anyways it's pretty
straightforward<00:06:34.770> just<00:06:35.009> to<00:06:35.490> keep<00:06:35.669> in<00:06:35.819> mind

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:36.059 
straightforward just to keep in mind

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.379 
straightforward just to keep in mind
that<00:06:37.020> the<00:06:37.620> pluses<00:06:38.069> and<00:06:38.249> minuses<00:06:38.759> will<00:06:39.180> be<00:06:39.360> a

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
that the pluses and minuses will be a

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.040 
that the pluses and minuses will be a
kind<00:06:39.960> of<00:06:40.080> random<00:06:40.759> based<00:06:41.759> on<00:06:42.149> you<00:06:42.870> know<00:06:42.930> how

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
kind of random based on you know how

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.639 
kind of random based on you know how
you've<00:06:43.229> got<00:06:43.529> the<00:06:44.279> servos<00:06:44.699> set<00:06:45.240> up<00:06:45.419> as<00:06:45.629> you<00:06:46.409> can

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:46.649 
you've got the servos set up as you can

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:48.889 
you've got the servos set up as you can
see<00:06:46.710> here<00:06:47.279> yeah<00:06:47.729> I've<00:06:47.909> just<00:06:47.939> got<00:06:48.180> them<00:06:48.509> opposed

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:48.899 
see here yeah I've just got them opposed

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:51.260 
see here yeah I've just got them opposed
left<00:06:49.680> and<00:06:49.889> right<00:06:50.129> for<00:06:50.669> you<00:06:50.759> know<00:06:50.819> for<00:06:50.999> symmetry

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
left and right for you know for symmetry

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.809 
left and right for you know for symmetry
on<00:06:51.539> the<00:06:51.659> plane<00:06:51.990> you<00:06:52.830> could<00:06:53.009> have<00:06:53.249> your<00:06:53.430> set<00:06:53.669> up

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 
on the plane you could have your set up

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.980 
on the plane you could have your set up
differently<00:06:54.349> but<00:06:55.349> basically<00:06:56.189> you<00:06:56.639> mix<00:06:57.209> in<00:06:57.449> the

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
differently but basically you mix in the

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.070 
differently but basically you mix in the
elevator<00:06:58.409> first<00:06:58.860> to<00:06:59.459> make<00:06:59.610> sure<00:06:59.669> the<00:07:00.539> up<00:07:00.899> and

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
elevator first to make sure the up and

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.040 
elevator first to make sure the up and
down<00:07:01.229> motion<00:07:01.499> is<00:07:01.949> correct<00:07:02.520> and<00:07:02.759> then<00:07:03.479> mix<00:07:03.839> in

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
down motion is correct and then mix in

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.589 
down motion is correct and then mix in
the<00:07:04.229> aileron<00:07:04.789> remember<00:07:05.789> when<00:07:06.059> you<00:07:06.180> push<00:07:06.389> the

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 
the aileron remember when you push the

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:09.079 
the aileron remember when you push the
stick<00:07:06.839> left<00:07:07.199> the<00:07:07.800> left<00:07:08.099> side<00:07:08.370> should<00:07:08.699> go<00:07:08.879> up

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.089 
stick left the left side should go up

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:11.719 
stick left the left side should go up
when<00:07:09.839> you<00:07:09.930> push<00:07:10.169> the<00:07:10.379> stick<00:07:10.649> right<00:07:10.680> the<00:07:11.550> right

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
when you push the stick right the right

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.019 
when you push the stick right the right
side<00:07:12.300> should<00:07:12.539> go<00:07:12.719> up<00:07:12.839> do<00:07:13.620> all<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:13.949> and<00:07:14.249> you

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
side should go up do all that and you

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.259 
side should go up do all that and you
shouldn't<00:07:15.360> have<00:07:15.419> a<00:07:15.569> problem<00:07:16.729> doing<00:07:17.729> Elavon

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:18.269 
shouldn't have a problem doing Elavon

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:23.449 
shouldn't have a problem doing Elavon
mixing<00:07:18.779> on<00:07:18.959> on<00:07:19.919> the<00:07:20.669> ER<00:07:20.969> my<00:07:21.120> next
