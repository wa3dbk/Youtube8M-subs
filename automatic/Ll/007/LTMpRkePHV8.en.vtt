 from six fifteen 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.200
 later I wanted to tell you a series of 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.570
 tips and recommendations how can 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.510
 be therefore different areas of interest 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.850
 where can you see the rally section 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.340
 sprint as we all know comes out of the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.950
 The village of Mo Danish enters the village 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.500
 from the vallín to the artosa and finish 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.590
 in the goal is in the village of boronas 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.880
 as recommendations then the paella of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.640
 exit 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.540
 the intermediate zone in the valley and in the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.850
 chapel a narrow zone with humidities 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.910
 mud since in recent years we have 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.190
 had rain and it gets in the area 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.710
 quite complicated afterwards it is also 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.230
 very interesting a paella that 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.780
 finds just before the descent that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 It is very spectacular and very fast and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.170
 we enter the jump that is also 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.960
 spectacular as we have every year 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.660
 a lot of images and how can you 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.540
 check on the poster as we have a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.060
 very spectacular photo of the jump of 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.010
 our pilot asdrúbal that also 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.310
 will be this year disputing the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.070
 rallysprint and already after we recommend 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.080
 also the area towards the goal that good 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.570
 In recent years some pilots have 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 had a problem in that area and have 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.060
 had to leave 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.980
 apart from the areas of interest it is very 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.079
 important to respect the measures of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.819
 security if we do not want to go out in any 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.890
 television news of course because 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.900
 lately we see that in the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.260
 only the rallies leave when 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.379
 there is some accident not good to recommend 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.780
 especially to be located in very high areas 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.260
 important and above all not to be placed in 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.810
 areas forbidden to the public and in areas 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.989
 which is the yellow ribbon 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.940
 On the other hand, recommend them also 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.340
 all the public that attends to see the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.670
 rallysprint than to enjoy it 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.440
 fully and have a great time to pay attention 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.660
 of the councils of the commissioners 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.810
 sports that are found during 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.880
 the whole stretch and also very I think that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.640
 It is very important that we do not leave trash 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.739
 that we take care of the environment so that good 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.230
 the people of the villages of the valley and the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.660
 artosa and boronas are happy and the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.859
 day you count do not find a 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.350
 dump not good also thank you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.690
