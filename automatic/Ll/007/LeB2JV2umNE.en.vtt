00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.110
 we will be interested in this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.520
 first capsule to the formation of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.519
 images at the bottom of the eye ie 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.559
 how images can form 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 in a clear way at the back of the eye if 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 we dissect an eye 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.330
 we see that it is made up of three 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.550
 concentric envelopes 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.430
 we first outside there 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 sclera below the choroid and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.969
 finally the retina that is represented here 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 so by a brown layer in front of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.100
 the sclera eye becomes 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.379
 transparent and will form what we 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.629
 call the choroidal cornea when she 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.289
 in the front of the eye will color for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 train what's called the iris she's going 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.930
 stop at this zone 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.090
 called the pupil then the iris is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 contract and expand what regulates 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 the amount of light that gets into 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.840
 the eye then the light that reaches 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:17.189
 the eye first reaches the cornea 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:22.049
 the aqueous humor the crystalline body 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.310
 glazed where the vitreous humor and finally the image 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.259
 is formed basically on art and they have 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.590
 finally the light that runs through 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.729
 the eye to reach the retina and well 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 crosses transparent backgrounds the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.659
 light rays that come from a 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.100
 distant object parallel to each other a 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.009
 once refracted deviated by the cornea then 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 by the lens that plays the role in 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.299
 makes a lens convergent and well 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.149
 will converge at one point 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:00.299
 the focus and if the eye does not show any 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.299
 anomaly of vision is this point 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.619
 of convergence was seeing itself lies on the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.689
 retina while we will see at the time there to 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.270
 some anomalies of vision then in 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.490
 physical 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.190
 you have certainly already assimilated 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.530
 the eye to a lens convergent and 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.740
 on this diagram you without recalling the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.880
 principles of constructing an image to 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.590
 so from a lens of an object 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.130
 in the picture goes through a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.020
 converging lens 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.130
 then the crystalline in the shape of a 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.630
 lens by convex and transparent 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.110
 we see here that it is organized in 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.300
 concentric fibers and fibers 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.150
 concentric consist of 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.210
 cells that we see here that are in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.700
 is devoid of core and containing 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.290
 a soluble and transparent protein 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.260
 we call the cristaline so 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.780
 finally the lens is a 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.900
 structure of the eye that owes its 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.780
 transparency so to a peculiarity of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.850
 these cells 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.710
 the lens acts as a 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.360
 deformable lens indeed when 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.340
 close object have lifted just now 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.100
 to form a sharp image on the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.690
 retina the lens goes so-called 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.490
 to accommodate that is to say that he is going 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.730
 decrease as seen here 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.120
 its radius of curvature its phase 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.000
 previous is going to bulge and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.940
 the image they were beyond the eye 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.440
 well eventually will be brought back on the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.010
 retina the lens and elastic it 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.380
 can be deformed by slipping 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.890
 on the other fibers that 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.100
 constitute and in particular its deformation 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.440
 will be controlled by muscles on 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.190
 call ciliary muscles so 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.000
 represented here that are connected 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.970
 finally attached to the lens because we 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.060
 call the zone hull 2 ​​in that matches 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.570
 in fact to suspensory ligament so 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 connected between the lens and the muscles 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.860
 cl yesterday so what happens when a 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.860
 distant object and well the muscles 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.210
 ciliary are released what will 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.980
 cause tension of the ligament and 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.170
 so the lens 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.410
 will be released or flattened we see it 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.980
 here if the ciliary fibers are released 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.760
 and the ligament is going to be tight and that 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.990
 so will shoot the lens and he'll 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.030
 to have a so-called loose form on the other hand 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.100
 in the case of a close object where 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.770
 normally if we do not do anything 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.510
 accommodation if the lens does not 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.900
 does not distort the image is located at 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.920
 the rear 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.650
 so we have to change the curvature of the 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.630
 crystalline and well this time the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.800
 ciliary muscles contracts so that's 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.950
 for example when you are in the process of 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.040
 read 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.350
 so the muscles if yesterday contracts and 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.020
 it is clear that by contracting the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.970
 ciliary muscles release tension 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.750
 that there was on the ligaments 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:15.770
 suspensions here compared to these 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:19.130
 so is ultimately the crystalline goes 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.770
 take a more bulging form he goes 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.870
 increase its convergence and rays 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.550
 bright will be able to converge here 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.050
 much closer with a focus so 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.660
 closer then is converged on the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.000
 retina then you have to know that this 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.970
 curvature modification and realized by 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.390
 reflex way actually there is detection by 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.250
 the cerebral cortex of a blurred image and 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.610
 it will automatically lead to sending 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.250
 of messages controlling the contraction 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.720
 stretcher muscle that's what's 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.940
 goes on I told you when you're in 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.760
 to say then let's quote a few 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.500
 anomalies related to aging 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.780
 of the crystalline for example in the case 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.370
 a myopic eye and well the lens 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.510
 is too bombs and the too converge 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.930
 and the image are formed in front of the 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.230
 retina 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.630
 this image is therefore blurred on the contrary 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.940
 as part of a hyperopic eye the 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.720
 crystalline is past convergent it is 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.410
 less bulging and the image will project to 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.270
 the back of the retina if the lens 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.110
 loses its transparency and well its 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.780
 opacification will hinder the transmission 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.890
 light rays and will result in 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.120
 vision disorders this is what we 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.250
 call cataract 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.470
 for example here we see a vision with 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.690
 cataracts the whole field of the visual 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.620
 is fuzzy and well can happen as soon 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.199
 young age in case of transfer 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.910
 genetics or so this is the case most 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.010
 frequent with aging what we 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.850
 call the cataract scene it takes 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.380
 know that there are factors of 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.290
 the environment like ultraviolet 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.940
 smoke a significant amount of sugar in 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.130
 the meaning we will call diabetes who 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.660
 can be responsible for these 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.860
 modifications ie water here 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:03.350
 pacification of the crystalline finally for 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.320
 finish with a last related anomalies 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.960
 at the vision well with age the 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.960
 crystalline can also lose its 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.770
 elasticity and so ultimately 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:20.080
 accommodation will be more difficult 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.080
 and this is called presbyopia
