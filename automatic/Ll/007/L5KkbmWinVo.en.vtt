00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.940
 so friends we look at the today 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.910
 new water cooling from cool master 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.350
 and that since 120 v in the second 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.760
 revised version 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.130
 this is a 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.390
 all-in-one water cooling that is how 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.750
 you see here the whole is already 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.490
 pre-assembled you do not have to hose 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 and everything afterwards but the whole 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.450
 a complete package at the now in the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.590
 second version after the fan 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.600
 was revised 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.960
 that means this should be much quieter 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.630
 his as well as the pump and the whole 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 system works for every mainboard resp 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.020
 for any processor no matter of amd or 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.370
 from intel 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.890
 no matter if all the 775 socket or newer 20 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.800
 11 3 actually for every system 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.600
 suitable and we compare the whole 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.120
 sometimes with a normal 40 euro 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 air cooler as the whole thing cuts off 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.940
 what temperature and volume at last 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.530
 so again briefly to the system so 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.290
 from the feel so like the whole 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.760
 It feels really well processed too 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.750
 relatively easy that has me personally 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.210
 wondered and I had mine now 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.000
 no flaws that means something for 40 euros 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.460
 Extremely little in this water cooling 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 is the whole really top processed 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 I can not say so then we look 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.799
 what the system can do i have it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.930
 here on my xeon 1231 strapped that 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.290
 is a normal ii 7 quasi only 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.909
 a bit cooler and we'll hear each other now 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.159
 at such a small soundcheck below 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.729
 full load four snow off the i30 and how 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.729
 the water cooling 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.360
 heard under load are both 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.550
 actually exactly as loud as sees 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.310
 it with the temperatures from the i30 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.140
 runs after an hour of prime 95 that is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.259
 for an hour long cores on full load 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.750
 to a maximum of 70 degrees water cooling 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.980
 on the other hand, we are a bit higher here 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.930
 now at 75 degrees on the warmest core 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.760
 but everything is still in a relative 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 good measure that is both 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.090
 actually acceptable 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.860
 that is when the volume is under load 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.990
 the temperatures are the same right away 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.459
 Almost equal is where is the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.420
 difference or what would 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.670
 I recommend 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.530
 and now we come to the biggest 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 Critic of such all-in-one 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.730
 water cooling because this pump is not 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.650
 decoupled that means in normal operation 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.580
 if you do not do anything on your pc 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.370
 no burden 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.959
 then you will always hear this pump out there 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.940
 An air cooling unit is as good as 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.489
 silent and the all-in-one water cooling 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.590
 and just on such a funny thing 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.300
 level I soundproofed that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.730
 housing and I hear it anyway 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.370
 and right here I would say hey people 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.140
 everything under 50 euro will pick you up 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 rather a LuftkÃ¼hlung because with it ride 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.570
 you actually in most cases 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.670
 significantly better 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.320
 that was from my side i hope that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.820
 failed again if so I would 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 I am very happy about a rating 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.610
 and because you already have experiences 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.470
 with such small compact 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.120
 You could have water cooling done me 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.920
 yes is in the comments write 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.239
 that was it from my side see me 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.239
 us at the next video ciao
