and<00:01:56.479> finally<00:01:56.990> actually<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.380> decreased<00:01:57.830> risk<00:01:58.009> of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and finally actually a decreased risk of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.030 
and finally actually a decreased risk of
heart<00:01:59.330> disease<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.659> cancer<00:01:59.840> with<00:02:00.830> this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
heart disease and cancer with this

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.910 
heart disease and cancer with this
substance<00:02:01.759> slash<00:02:02.150> supplement<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.799> is

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
substance slash supplement so what is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.469 
substance slash supplement so what is
the<00:02:04.040> magic<00:02:04.220> supplement<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.030> talking<00:02:05.390> about

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the magic supplement we're talking about

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.810 
the magic supplement we're talking about
here<00:02:05.840> coach<00:02:06.110> sounds<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.070> carbohydrates<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
here coach sounds like carbohydrates to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.319 
here coach sounds like carbohydrates to
me<00:02:07.909> carbohydrates<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.950> all<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.670> low-carb

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
me carbohydrates so all this low-carb

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.089 
me carbohydrates so all this low-carb
craze<00:02:11.689> we<00:02:12.049> have<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.409> have<00:02:12.590> at<00:02:12.769> least<00:02:12.860> an

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
craze we have to have at least an

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.190 
craze we have to have at least an
established<00:02:13.700> threshold<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.390> carbohydrates

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
established threshold of carbohydrates

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.309 
established threshold of carbohydrates
to<00:02:15.880> not<00:02:16.880> only<00:02:17.030> maintain<00:02:17.360> function<00:02:18.170> but

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
to not only maintain function but

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.820 
to not only maintain function but
replenish<00:02:18.800> glycogen<00:02:18.950> levels

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
replenish glycogen levels

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.820 
replenish glycogen levels
again<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:20.910> mp3<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.780> truth<00:02:21.990> about<00:02:22.290> diet<00:02:22.530> if

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
adequate enough carbohydrate then what's

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.190 
adequate enough carbohydrate then what's
gonna<00:02:43.530> happen<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:45.630> we<00:02:45.780> noticed<00:02:46.110> with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
gonna happen is like we noticed with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.650 
gonna happen is like we noticed with
vitamin<00:02:46.710> deficiency<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.330> enough

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
vitamin deficiency when you have enough

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.320 
vitamin deficiency when you have enough
vitamins<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.220> notice<00:02:50.580> any<00:02:50.790> promoted

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
health effects but without specific
vitamins<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.300> real<00:02:54.480> sick<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
vitamins you can get real sick and the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.440 
vitamins you can get real sick and the
same<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.770> true<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:56.040> carbohydrates<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.060> what<00:02:57.330> we

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
same is true of carbohydrates so what we

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.930 
same is true of carbohydrates so what we
see<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> with<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.710> lack<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.190> threshold

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
see is with a lack of threshold

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.090 
see is with a lack of threshold

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
we actually compromised our immune

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.280 
we actually compromised our immune

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.449 
and compete usually get sick right after
and<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.890> lack<00:03:44.430> of
