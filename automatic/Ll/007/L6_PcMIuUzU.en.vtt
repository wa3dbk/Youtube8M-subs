00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.710
 when I was in England I have 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.530
 tried many delicious desserts including 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.809
 a wonderful barry chocolate iphone 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.549
 two layers of wrapping cream of 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.740
 cookies to be sure of 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.260
 spoil us enough decoration with 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.720
 cream and strawberries I know it looks like a spot but 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.430
 I guarantee you that it is just like that 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.520
 together we prepare title strawberries and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.520
 chocolate 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.820
 as you will see this recipe is very fast 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 then immediately cut the strawberries for the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 composed 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.120
 I light the stove and immediately turn to it 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.120
 tales 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.030
 then the sugar 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.530
 from a nice mix and let go to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.300
 rather bright flame because of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.930
 strawberries must flake and dry 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.930
 of vegetation liquid 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.070
 it will take about a quarter of an hour twenty 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.659
 minutes in the meantime we prepare the cream 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.240
 towards only three quarters of this dose 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.170
 of milk that we add the sugar but 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.170
 it is a drop of vanilla essence 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.179
 stir a little and leave on a flame 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.179
 low 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.030
 meanwhile sieve the starch to prepare 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.030
 the rest of the cream 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 little trick for not making the dance 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.240
 bowl for the whole bathroom anto kitchen 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.810
 paper pox pinch and then alone 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.810
 under the bowl 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.220
 now I can add milk 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780
 no 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.849
 now that I've diluted it well 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.440
 I reach in hot milk I should 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.680
 always mix the cream otherwise 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.360
 could clot now leave 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.069
 cool the cream then pour it in 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.780
 this bowl and I cover it with film 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.400
 in contact 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.340
 in this way I will avoid the formation of the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.750
 crust and as soon as the compote will do 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.750
 ready to sift her too 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.160
 I let it cool completely 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.690
 cream and make it this way 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.140
 when I go to join them they will not create 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 bluetooth 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 perhaps to mix better you were not 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.640
 see it's become smooth I can 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 transfer it to the door bag 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.269
 at the time of whipping cream 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.990
 add the icing sugar already 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.990
 sifted 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 I put the cream in the bush bag e 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.430
 now I 'm ready to compose mine 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.840
 iphone in favor chocolate therefore for 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.840
 first thing I put the cream 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.030
 now the cookies 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.290
 some more cream 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.639
 and then the strawberries 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.590
 and now the whipped cream 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.550
 finishing touch a strawberry and more 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.550
 crumbled biscuits 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.609
 I continue with all the others 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.659
 ingredients for 4 pray for strawberries and 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:15.259
 chocolate for the cream 330 grams of 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.779
 whole milk 60 g of granulated sugar 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:21.629
 one gram of essence of Venice 35 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.319
 grams of corn starch 55 grams of 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:28.159
 oreo biscuits for the compote 400 grams 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:33.149
 of strawberries 150 g of granulated sugar 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:35.639
 to decorate 120 grams of strawberries 250 g 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.389
 of liquid cream 100 g of sugar a 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.179
 veil 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.159
 an iphone strawberry in english means 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:43.199
 nonsense and in fact it is seen as the 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.649
 simple to prepare them chocolate boards 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.669
 you don't need other combinations 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.349
 probably the English at this time 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.179
 they are enjoying in mind but me 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.360
 I prefer a good episode of this 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.360
 mountain
