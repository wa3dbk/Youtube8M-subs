we feel comfortable with with where

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
we feel comfortable with with where
things<00:00:30.239> are<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.079> basically<00:00:31.529> confirms

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
things are and that basically confirms

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.810 
things are and that basically confirms
the<00:00:32.160> geometry<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> bridge<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.370> adjusted

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the geometry of the bridge we adjusted

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.210 
the geometry of the bridge we adjusted
the<00:00:35.940> design<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> their<00:00:36.930> steep<00:00:37.770> angle

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
the design because of their steep angle

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.460

look down to here interested markings of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
look down to here interested markings of
that<00:00:48.330> level<00:00:48.770> design<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.100> increase<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that level design and increase the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
that level design and increase the
efficiency<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.390> reached<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> goal<00:00:52.740> of<00:00:52.830> our

efficiency also reached the goal of our

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
efficiency also reached the goal of our
project<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.760> minimize<00:00:54.240> disturbance

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
project is really minimize disturbance

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
project is really minimize disturbance
to<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.380> valley<00:00:55.560> below<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.250> bridge<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to the valley below the bridge and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
to the valley below the bridge and
there's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.570> creek<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.260> runs

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
there's a little creek that kind of runs

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.190 
there's a little creek that kind of runs
down<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> bottom<00:00:59.310> here<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.080> that's<00:01:01.080> all

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
down in the bottom here and that's all

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.980 
down in the bottom here and that's all
gonna<00:01:01.380> be<00:01:01.590> kept<00:01:01.800> natural<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.240> the<00:01:03.330> slopes

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
gonna be kept natural and and the slopes

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.740 
gonna be kept natural and and the slopes
are<00:01:04.170> pretty<00:01:04.350> gradual<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.159> some<00:01:05.339> trails

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
are pretty gradual with some trails

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
are pretty gradual with some trails
skirting<00:01:06.750> either<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> scouts

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
skirting either side and so the scouts

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
skirting either side and so the scouts
will<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> come<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
will be able to come down and be able to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
will be able to come down and be able to
see<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> bridge<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:10.980> underneath<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.730> this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
see the bridge from underneath in this
kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> natural<00:01:12.630> habitat<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.580> from<00:01:14.580> where

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
kind of natural habitat and from where

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.950 
kind of natural habitat and from where
we're<00:01:14.909> standing<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.480> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.690> be<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
we're standing it's going to be about

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.520 
we're standing it's going to be about
nine<00:01:16.230> stories<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> bridge<00:01:17.730> deck<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
nine stories up to the bridge deck and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.500 
nine stories up to the bridge deck and
you'll<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.370> cables<00:01:20.580> coming

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510

you'll see that the cables coming
underneath<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.080> main<00:01:22.530> deck<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.640> can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
underneath the main deck and you can

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.430 
underneath the main deck and you can
just<00:01:23.940> visualize<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.690> scouts<00:01:25.050> kind<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
just visualize the scouts kind of

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.050 
just visualize the scouts kind of
shouting<00:01:25.620> down<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.100> each<00:01:26.190> other<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> shouting

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
shouting down to each other and shouting

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.500 
shouting down to each other and shouting
up

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
up

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.230 
up
there<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.410> wooded<00:01:29.160> area<00:01:29.280> pretty

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
there and this wooded area pretty

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
there and this wooded area pretty
exciting<00:01:30.600> trails<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.830> up<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.670> down<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
exciting trails come on up and down the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.250 
exciting trails come on up and down the
valley<00:01:33.000> they're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> awesome<00:01:33.900> when

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
valley they're gonna be awesome when

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.020 
valley they're gonna be awesome when
you're<00:01:34.410> crossing

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.960 

so<00:01:41.540> we're<00:01:41.660> at<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> New<00:01:41.960> River<00:01:42.110> Gorge<00:01:42.230> Bridge

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
so we're at the New River Gorge Bridge

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.400 
so we're at the New River Gorge Bridge
we're<00:01:43.970> up<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.330> catwalks<00:01:44.750> underneath<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
we're up on the catwalks underneath the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.610 
we're up on the catwalks underneath the
roadway<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.820> bridge<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:47.780> almost<00:01:48.140> 900

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
roadway this bridge is is almost 900

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.410 
roadway this bridge is is almost 900
feet<00:01:48.830> above<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.220> valley<00:01:49.400> floor<00:01:49.490> while<00:01:50.180> ours

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
feet above the valley floor while ours

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.900 
feet above the valley floor while ours
will<00:01:50.690> be<00:01:50.830> 100<00:01:51.830> feet<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.370> this<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.550> obviously

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
will be 100 feet so this is obviously

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
will be 100 feet so this is obviously
taller<00:01:53.420> but<00:01:54.670> it'll<00:01:55.670> help<00:01:55.820> us<00:01:56.030> understand<00:01:56.570> like

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
taller but it'll help us understand like

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.080 
taller but it'll help us understand like
a<00:01:57.290> Scouts<00:01:57.740> experience<00:01:58.310> being<00:01:58.580> up<00:01:58.760> on<00:01:58.910> those

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
a Scouts experience being up on those

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.540 
a Scouts experience being up on those
walkways<00:01:59.390> on<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:00.590> bridge<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.100> particular

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
walkways on this bridge in particular

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.990 
walkways on this bridge in particular
it's<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.479> highway<00:02:02.840> bridge<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.000> vibrations

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
it's a highway bridge so vibrations

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.330 
it's a highway bridge so vibrations
aren't<00:02:05.240> as<00:02:05.479> big<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.840> concern<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:07.160> when

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
aren't as big of a concern but when

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.680 
aren't as big of a concern but when
you're<00:02:07.460> walking<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.030> bridge<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.270> really

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you're walking on the bridge you really

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
you're walking on the bridge you really
feel<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.100> something<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
feel it and and that's something that

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.330 
feel it and and that's something that
we're<00:02:10.910> considering<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.630> wingtip<00:02:12.080> bridge<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
we're considering on wingtip bridge the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.520 
we're considering on wingtip bridge the
secondary<00:02:14.030> walkways<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.870> are<00:02:15.020> going<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> feel

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
secondary walkways you are going to feel

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.310 
secondary walkways you are going to feel
the<00:02:15.709> movement<00:02:16.300> but<00:02:17.300> vertical<00:02:17.810> movement<00:02:18.170> is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the movement but vertical movement is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320 
the movement but vertical movement is
actually<00:02:18.680> more<00:02:18.860> comfortable<00:02:19.160> than<00:02:19.459> lateral

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
actually more comfortable than lateral

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330 
actually more comfortable than lateral
movement<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.470> that's<00:02:21.650> why<00:02:21.830> we<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
movement and so that's why we have the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.470 
movement and so that's why we have the
blade<00:02:23.270> stays<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.020> back<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.739> stabilize<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
blade stays the back to stabilize the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.080 
blade stays the back to stabilize the
structure<00:02:26.780> against<00:02:27.260> swaying<00:02:28.070> side<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> side

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
structure against swaying side to side

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:42.770 
structure against swaying side to side
but<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.930> really<00:02:30.170> feel<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.739> thing

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.900 

but<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.740> knew<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.250> during<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.610> competition

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
but I knew is during the competition

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.490 
but I knew is during the competition
when<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> saw<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.870> which<00:02:46.020> we<00:02:46.200> could<00:02:46.350> be

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
when I saw this in which we could be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.610 
when I saw this in which we could be
something<00:02:46.710> related<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> boys

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.680 

well<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.700> wrapped<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:54.269> tour<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
well we just wrapped up our tour of the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.500 
well we just wrapped up our tour of the
New<00:02:54.810> River<00:02:54.959> Gorge<00:02:55.260> Bridge<00:02:56.180> very<00:02:57.180> educational

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
New River Gorge Bridge very educational

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.229 
New River Gorge Bridge very educational
hoping<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> put<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.590> all<00:02:58.709> together<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.239> put

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
hoping to put that all together and put

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.259 
hoping to put that all together and put
it<00:03:00.720> into<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> wingtip<00:03:01.560> bridge<00:03:01.849> we<00:03:02.849> will<00:03:03.120> see

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
it into the wingtip bridge we will see

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.319 
it into the wingtip bridge we will see
you<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.390> 2013
