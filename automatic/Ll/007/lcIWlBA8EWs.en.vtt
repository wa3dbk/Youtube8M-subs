you want to make two of these and stick
them<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.470> ground<00:01:05.500> side-by-side<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
them in the ground side-by-side this

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.380 
them in the ground side-by-side this
trap<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:12.310> 550<00:01:12.820> paracord

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
trap is 550 paracord

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.790 
trap is 550 paracord
which<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.690> bought<00:01:13.810> here<00:01:14.020> for<00:01:14.050> this<00:01:14.230> video

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
which I bought here for this video

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.740 
which I bought here for this video
reason<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.730> good<00:01:15.940> as<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.300> name<00:01:16.480> quite

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
reason this is good as in the name quite

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.930 
reason this is good as in the name quite
people<00:01:17.050> power<00:01:17.230> cord<00:01:17.470> between<00:01:17.770> 550<00:01:18.400> pounds<00:01:18.700> of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
people power cord between 550 pounds of

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.400 
people power cord between 550 pounds of
weight<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.780> would<00:01:19.870> be<00:01:19.960> good<00:01:20.110> if<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.260> wanted

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
weight so it would be good if you wanted

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.550 
weight so it would be good if you wanted
to<00:01:20.500> make<00:01:20.620> a<00:01:20.650> man-sized<00:01:21.100> trap<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.960> however<00:01:23.380> was

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
to make a man-sized trap and however was

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.070 
to make a man-sized trap and however was
that's<00:01:23.770> like<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.040> one<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.220> found<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.990> this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
that's like the one I found in this

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.560 
that's like the one I found in this
pretty<00:01:26.410> room<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.820> attached<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.390> might

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.490 
screening
and<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:35.650> ideal<00:01:35.950> but<00:01:36.520> small<00:01:37.000> game<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.380> I've

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
and what ideal but small game so I've

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.230 
and what ideal but small game so I've
done<00:01:38.710> here<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.580> line<00:01:39.729> attached<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
done here is if the line attached to the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.810 
done here is if the line attached to the
birch<00:01:40.479> comes<00:01:41.020> down<00:01:41.290> patched<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> straight

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
birch comes down patched in a straight

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.539 
birch comes down patched in a straight
stick<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.799> would<00:01:45.009> compound<00:01:45.369> in

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
stick here and that would compound in

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.490 
stick here and that would compound in
the<00:01:45.640> minute<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:46.930> want<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> keep<00:01:47.320> some

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the minute you just want to keep some

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.219 
the minute you just want to keep some
extra<00:01:47.710> slack<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:49.450> make<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.840> loop<00:01:50.020> that's

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
extra slack to make that loop that's

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.889 
extra slack to make that loop that's
when<00:01:50.409> caps<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:50.860> actually<00:01:51.250> only<00:01:51.899> when

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
when caps you out actually only when

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.480 
when caps you out actually only when
saying<00:01:53.140> up<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.409> trap<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.800> safety<00:01:54.159> reasons

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
saying up the trap the safety reasons

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.160 
saying up the trap the safety reasons
it's<00:01:54.670> best<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.000> be<00:01:55.180> on<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.420> side<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.899> trap

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
it's best to be on the side of the trap

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.620 
it's best to be on the side of the trap
not<00:01:56.530> one<00:01:56.920> or<00:01:57.399> behind<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:58.299> if<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.600> is

attached to the rope will more than

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.990 
attached to the rope will more than
likely<00:02:02.470> spring<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.549> hit<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.970> eye

why it's rather this is working and

why it's rather this is working and
you've<00:02:19.550> got<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.730> tension<00:02:20.120> coming<00:02:20.300> down<00:02:20.510> this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
you've got the tension coming down this

twist and spin out and go back up what's
happening<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:31.150> can't<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.270> out<00:02:32.450> because

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
happening here is can't go out because

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.840 
happening here is can't go out because
this<00:02:32.960> stick<00:02:33.290> which<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.190> connecting<00:02:34.790> between

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the Y's can't go up in higher therefore

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.060 
the Y's can't go up in higher therefore
it's<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.170> -<00:02:39.350> what<00:02:39.530> wants<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:39.950> is

it's out there - what wants to do is

where you're going to rest a little bit
to<00:02:44.930> create<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.230> platform<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.820> again<00:02:47.180> will

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
to create a platform and again will

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.470 
to create a platform and again will
steps<00:02:48.110> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.350> platform<00:02:49.000> push<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.210> stick

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
steps on the platform push that stick

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:00.220 
steps on the platform push that stick
down<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.080> equals<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.710> spin<00:02:52.490> up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.100

freedom<00:03:05.110> move<00:03:05.230> up<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.560> down<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.860> rope<00:03:06.040> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
freedom move up and down the rope and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.910 
freedom move up and down the rope and
attention<00:03:07.690> comes<00:03:07.900> down<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> animal<00:03:08.740> oh

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920
