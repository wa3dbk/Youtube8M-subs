this video is going to teach you the
different<00:00:03.080> kinds<00:00:03.230> of<00:00:03.470> fatty<00:00:03.710> acids<00:00:04.190> and<00:00:04.609> why

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:04.789 
different kinds of fatty acids and why

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:06.909 
different kinds of fatty acids and why
one<00:00:05.059> kind<00:00:05.359> is<00:00:05.600> different<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.079> other<00:00:06.109> will

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
one kind is different the other will

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.520 
one kind is different the other will
cover<00:00:07.099> topics<00:00:07.339> like<00:00:07.640> saturated<00:00:08.540> fatty<00:00:09.049> acids

the broad categories of saturated
unsaturated<00:00:23.540> fats<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.710> will<00:00:25.100> also<00:00:25.310> go<00:00:25.430> into

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
unsaturated fats I will also go into

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.170 
unsaturated fats I will also go into
trans<00:00:26.210> fats<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:26.840> sis<00:00:27.470> fats<00:00:27.770> for<00:00:28.370> those<00:00:28.550> trans

fats they're really bad once you've

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.600 
fats they're really bad once you've
probably<00:00:30.530> heard<00:00:30.770> about<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.190> want<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.430> avoid

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
probably heard about you want to avoid

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.460 
probably heard about you want to avoid
we'll<00:00:32.119> talk<00:00:32.270> about<00:00:32.390> what<00:00:32.599> those<00:00:32.750> are<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.200> why

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
we'll talk about what those are and why

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.950 
we'll talk about what those are and why
you<00:00:33.530> want<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.830> avoid<00:00:33.920> them<00:00:34.130> now<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.880> two<00:00:35.180> big

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
you want to avoid them now the two big

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.260 
you want to avoid them now the two big
categories<00:00:36.320> of<00:00:36.830> fats<00:00:37.070> are<00:00:37.370> saturated<00:00:37.820> and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
categories of fats are saturated and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.270 
categories of fats are saturated and
unsaturated<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.290> what<00:00:39.829> they're<00:00:39.980> talking

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
unsaturated and what they're talking

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.010 
unsaturated and what they're talking
about<00:00:40.370> when<00:00:40.520> they<00:00:40.610> say<00:00:40.820> those<00:00:40.970> two<00:00:41.180> things<00:00:41.210> are

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
about when they say those two things are

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.430 
about when they say those two things are
the<00:00:42.740> kind<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.390> carbon-carbon<00:00:44.390> bonds<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.320> are

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
the kind of carbon-carbon bonds that are

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.770 
the kind of carbon-carbon bonds that are
included<00:00:45.739> in<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.220> chain<00:00:46.579> or<00:00:47.000> in<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.300> carbon

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
included in the chain or in the carbon

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.420 
included in the chain or in the carbon
chain<00:00:47.810> at<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.170> backbone<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:48.980> these<00:00:49.160> fatty

acids now on saturated fatty acids

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.580

reason<00:00:53.149> why<00:00:53.239> they're<00:00:53.420> saturated<00:00:54.079> I'm<00:00:54.440> going

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
reason why they're saturated I'm going

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.870 
reason why they're saturated I'm going
to<00:00:54.649> keep<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:54.920> straight<00:00:55.130> ahead<00:00:55.310> is<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.640> think

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
to keep that straight ahead is to think

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.000 
to keep that straight ahead is to think
the<00:00:56.360> really<00:00:56.540> terms<00:00:56.810> of<00:00:56.930> stuff<00:00:57.200> as<00:00:57.410> many<00:00:57.739> atoms

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the really terms of stuff as many atoms

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.370 
the really terms of stuff as many atoms
as<00:00:58.370> make<00:00:58.550> connections<00:00:59.149> to<00:00:59.390> that<00:00:59.930> bond<00:01:00.170> as

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
as make connections to that bond as

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.110 
as make connections to that bond as
possible<00:01:00.829> they're<00:01:00.980> really<00:01:01.130> saturating<00:01:02.000> it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
possible they're really saturating it

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.569 
possible they're really saturating it
hence<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.570> name<00:01:02.660> saturated<00:01:03.649> really<00:01:04.100> sad<00:01:04.369> from

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
hence the name saturated really sad from

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.340 
hence the name saturated really sad from
that<00:01:04.699> bond<00:01:04.879> because<00:01:05.420> many<00:01:05.659> connections<00:01:06.049> as

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that bond because many connections as

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.559 
that bond because many connections as
possible<00:01:06.829> so<00:01:07.729> they<00:01:07.819> help<00:01:07.969> us<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:08.299> called<00:01:08.479> a

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
possible so they help us it's called a

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.800 
possible so they help us it's called a
single<00:01:09.159> carbon-carbon<00:01:10.159> bond<00:01:10.810> now

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
single carbon-carbon bond now

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.929 
single carbon-carbon bond now
unsaturated<00:01:12.649> like<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.490> name<00:01:13.670> would<00:01:13.819> suggest

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
unsaturated like the name would suggest

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.929 
unsaturated like the name would suggest
this<00:01:14.899> bond<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.319> really<00:01:15.679> not<00:01:15.889> saturated<00:01:16.579> atoms

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
this bond is really not saturated atoms

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.399 
this bond is really not saturated atoms
they're<00:01:17.090> not<00:01:17.209> kind<00:01:17.389> of<00:01:17.479> pack<00:01:17.719> as<00:01:17.929> many<00:01:18.049> things

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
they're not kind of pack as many things

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.440 
they're not kind of pack as many things
as<00:01:18.560> make<00:01:18.770> connections<00:01:19.249> around<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:19.969> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
as make connections around there and so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.969 
as make connections around there and so
they<00:01:20.569> have<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.749> double<00:01:21.139> bond<00:01:21.499> you<00:01:21.859> know<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
they have a double bond you know a

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:22.929 
they have a double bond you know a
little<00:01:22.159> bit<00:01:22.249> about<00:01:22.399> chemistry

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
little bit about chemistry

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.609 
little bit about chemistry
you<00:01:23.299> know<00:01:23.479> why<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:23.749> till<00:01:24.079> one<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:24.439> work

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
you know why this till one can work

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.959 
you know why this till one can work
while<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.039> chemical<00:01:25.429> structure<00:01:25.759> still

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
while this chemical structure still

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.270 
while this chemical structure still
works<00:01:26.149> but<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:26.899> video<00:01:27.229> suffice<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.039> say

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
works but for this video suffice to say

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.340 
works but for this video suffice to say
that<00:01:28.759> there's<00:01:29.299> not<00:01:29.450> as<00:01:29.600> many<00:01:29.719> connections<00:01:30.049> as

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
that there's not as many connections as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.830 
that there's not as many connections as
you<00:01:30.560> can<00:01:30.709> see<00:01:30.920> here<00:01:31.130> we<00:01:31.189> only<00:01:31.249> have<00:01:31.369> core<00:01:32.090> black

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
you can see here we only have core black

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840 
you can see here we only have core black
lines<00:01:33.200> around<00:01:33.709> this<00:01:33.889> carbon-carbon<00:01:34.340> bond

that's<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.609> same<00:02:04.700> case<00:02:05.179> down<00:02:05.419> here<00:02:05.479> at<00:02:05.689> the

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
that's the same case down here at the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.209 
that's the same case down here at the
Delmont<00:02:06.169> even<00:02:06.560> though<00:02:06.740> our<00:02:06.799> partners<00:02:07.069> make

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
Delmont even though our partners make

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.130 
Delmont even though our partners make
connections<00:02:07.669> they're<00:02:08.090> still<00:02:08.299> as<00:02:08.569> far<00:02:09.019> apart

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.490 
connections they're still as far apart
as<00:02:09.439> possible

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
as possible

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.040

so<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.710> degrees<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.880> gonna<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.150> about<00:02:12.270> 120

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so these degrees here gonna be about 120

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.160 
so these degrees here gonna be about 120
versus<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> 90<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:15.360> presents<00:02:15.570> an

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
versus the 90 and this presents an

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
versus the 90 and this presents an
interesting<00:02:16.650> case<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.100> really<00:02:17.490> where<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
interesting case and really where the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630 
interesting case and really where the
difference<00:02:18.480> arises<00:02:19.140> from<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.250> Accenture

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.300 
difference arises from in the Accenture
unsaturated<00:02:21.180> bonds<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.750> because<00:02:22.160> since<00:02:23.160> we

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
unsaturated bonds is because since we

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.090 
unsaturated bonds is because since we
have<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:24.390> equal<00:02:24.840> spacing<00:02:25.380> down<00:02:25.560> here<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
have not equal spacing down here and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.040 
have not equal spacing down here and
you're<00:02:26.250> dealing<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.700> chain<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:27.900> are

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
you're dealing with the chain there are

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.230 
you're dealing with the chain there are
different<00:02:28.410> orientations<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.340> unsaturated

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
different orientations and unsaturated

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.540 
different orientations and unsaturated
fatty<00:02:31.080> acid<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:32.070> opposed<00:02:32.460> to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
fatty acid can have as opposed to

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.850 
fatty acid can have as opposed to
saturate<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.050> see<00:02:34.200> these<00:02:34.320> ARS

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
saturate one so you see these ARS

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.520 
saturate one so you see these ARS
up<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> saturated<00:02:36.210> fatty<00:02:36.540> acid<00:02:36.960> think

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
up here the saturated fatty acid think

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
up here the saturated fatty acid think
of<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:37.770> ours<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.640> rest<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> chain

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
of those ours as the rest of the chain

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.330 
of those ours as the rest of the chain
that's<00:02:39.660> where<00:02:39.870> our<00:02:40.080> means<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.100> one

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that's where our means so this is one

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.880 
that's where our means so this is one
chain<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.660> let's<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.140> think<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.800> your

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
chain here let's just think of in your

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.550 
chain here let's just think of in your
head<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.390> metal<00:02:45.390> chain<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
head like a metal chain and this is the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.750 
head like a metal chain and this is the
end<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> chain<00:02:47.190> we're<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.550> looking<00:02:47.730> at

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
end of the chain we're just looking at

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.600 
end of the chain we're just looking at
one<00:02:48.060> link<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.840> bond<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.410> chain<00:02:49.650> down

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
one link or one bond in this chain down

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.120 
one link or one bond in this chain down
here<00:02:50.970> however<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.990> have<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.140> end<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:53.010> our

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
here however we have one end of our

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760 
here however we have one end of our
chain<00:02:53.160> 1r<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> haven't<00:02:54.990> drawn<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
chain 1r but I haven't drawn up the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.470 
chain 1r but I haven't drawn up the
other<00:02:55.980> arm<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.580> other<00:02:56.610> end<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> chain<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
other arm the other end of the chain and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.930 
other arm the other end of the chain and
the<00:02:57.630> reason<00:02:57.900> why<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:58.950> our

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the reason why that is is because our

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.330 
the reason why that is is because our
could<00:03:00.360> go<00:03:00.540> up<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:00.959> where<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.500> our<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:02.190> down

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
could go up here where the our go down

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
could go up here where the our go down
here<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.240> notice<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.959> put<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> our<00:03:04.410> up

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
here and you notice if we put the our up

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.560 
here and you notice if we put the our up

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
structure is pretty linear however if

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.910 
structure is pretty linear however if
you<00:03:27.690> put<00:03:27.900> R<00:03:28.140> down<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.760> notice<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.120> now

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
you put R down here you notice that now

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.380 
you put R down here you notice that now
it's<00:03:31.920> shaped<00:03:32.190> almost<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.640> boomerang<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
not be so linear in space it's gonna be

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.199 
not be so linear in space it's gonna be

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
if you go the trans is more linear

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.120 
if you go the trans is more linear
systems<00:04:06.630> more<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> boomerang<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.890> why<00:04:08.070> is

systems more like a boomerang and why is

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.920 
systems more like a boomerang and why is
this<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.489> important<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.480> important

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
this is important this is important

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.539 
this is important this is important
because<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.739> we'll<00:04:10.860> draw<00:04:11.070> out<00:04:11.220> what<00:04:11.430> this

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
because so we'll draw out what this

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.680 
because so we'll draw out what this
might<00:04:11.730> look<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:13.519> we<00:04:14.519> said<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.209> saturate

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
might look like as we said the saturate

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.570 
might look like as we said the saturate
is<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:16.019> very<00:04:16.200> linear<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> bunch

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
is gonna be very linear you have a bunch

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.770 
is gonna be very linear you have a bunch
of<00:04:17.669> 90<00:04:17.880> degrees<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.479> where<00:04:18.690> you're

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
of 90 degrees this is where you're

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.310 
of 90 degrees this is where you're
changing

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
changing

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.350 
changing
but<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:20.010> took<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.340> chain<00:04:20.640> all<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.090> way

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
but we took this chain all the way

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.500 
but we took this chain all the way
through<00:04:21.600> down<00:04:22.500> here<00:04:22.830> I'll<00:04:23.610> draw<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.820> cyst<00:04:24.180> first

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
through down here I'll draw a cyst first

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.320 
through down here I'll draw a cyst first
we're<00:04:25.410> now<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.590> straight<00:04:25.950> line<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.700> then<00:04:27.180> it's

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
we're now a straight line and then it's

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.960 
we're now a straight line and then it's
gonna<00:04:27.480> Bend<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.500> let's<00:04:28.620> say<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.100> would<00:04:29.940> be

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
gonna Bend so let's say that would be

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.000 
gonna Bend so let's say that would be
our<00:04:30.210> sis<00:04:30.510> pond<00:04:30.750> right<00:04:30.990> therapy<00:04:31.320> arc<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.740> bond

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
our sis pond right therapy arc this bond

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.050 
our sis pond right therapy arc this bond
and<00:04:32.400> for<00:04:32.970> trans<00:04:35.270> you're<00:04:36.270> gonna<00:04:36.390> have<00:04:38.060> pretty

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
and for trans you're gonna have pretty

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.710 
and for trans you're gonna have pretty
much<00:04:39.620> another<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.800> linear<00:04:41.130> fatty<00:04:41.820> acid<00:04:42.300> just

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
much another of linear fatty acid just

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.690 
much another of linear fatty acid just
like<00:04:42.900> our<00:04:43.170> saturated<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.400> right<00:04:44.520> here<00:04:44.610> you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
like our saturated so right here you

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.700 
like our saturated so right here you
have<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.820> trans<00:04:45.210> unsaturated<00:04:45.480> fatty<00:04:46.320> acid

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
have a trans unsaturated fatty acid

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.490 
have a trans unsaturated fatty acid
that's<00:04:46.800> pretty<00:04:47.070> much<00:04:47.130> linear<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.640> assist

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
that's pretty much linear and assist

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.080 
that's pretty much linear and assist
unsaturated<00:04:49.500> one<00:04:49.740> which<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.130> not<00:04:50.670> very<00:04:50.910> linear

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
unsaturated one which is not very linear

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.200 
unsaturated one which is not very linear
now<00:04:51.870> move<00:04:52.410> over<00:04:52.500> here<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:52.950> cell<00:04:53.280> as<00:04:53.610> you

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
going to allow for less mobility so

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.140 
going to allow for less mobility so

premier look pretty much like the trans

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.940 
premier look pretty much like the trans
and<00:06:03.540> for<00:06:03.750> reasons<00:06:04.020> I<00:06:04.110> won't<00:06:04.230> go<00:06:04.410> into<00:06:04.590> right

now the saturated bonds although they do

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.130 
now the saturated bonds although they do
look<00:06:08.730> a<00:06:08.790> little<00:06:08.940> bit<00:06:09.090> like<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.390> trans<00:06:09.690> they're

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
look a little bit like the trans they're

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.630 
look a little bit like the trans they're
actually<00:06:10.470> healthier<00:06:10.890> than<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.100> than<00:06:11.550> the

trans unsaturated fatty acids so in
