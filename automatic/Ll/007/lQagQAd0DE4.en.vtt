patty<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.860> pulled<00:02:05.100> pork<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
patty and the pulled pork I think it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219

would<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.659> bit<00:02:06.840> better<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
would be a little bit better and it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.359 
would be a little bit better and it
would<00:02:07.290> push<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> five<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.190> five

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
would push it to that five out of five

would push it to that five out of five
but<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.300> is
