00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730

 toni which is in charge of all 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.790
 controls have an exceptional ear and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.610
 I personally have had 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.229
 earnings with work recording I'm 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 very happy about the sound and sharpness 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.200
 who stole on this record the experience 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.880
 of bbva hungry with lots and it was 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.270

 recording I think we're very 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.549
 satisfied with the result and I think that 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.649
 We would highly recommend a record 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.979
 because centered with our 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.979
 professionalism 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.910
 hello my name is alejandra d 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.580
 the experience in such records has been 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.290
 pretty complete 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.320
 I came here with a project with a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.020
 idea with a model and well known 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.300
 anthony seemed to me part of the world 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.460
 operate a person with whom you can 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.160
 start to upload experience here was 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.130
 great since I had to play all 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.230
 the instruments therefore I had 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.310
 pretty support from the sun and it took quite 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.560
 weather 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 the price was quite spectacular in 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.620
 the sense of putting it compared to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.100
 recording studio subjects I had 7 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.590
 years looking for a structure that could 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.570
 shape my current civil work 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.580
 produce it by trying resources 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.620
 Currently my album is produced 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.870
 It has an international distribution 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.480
 is on iTunes and is in the portals of 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.030
 then good internet then it's all a 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.340
 world where you start without arriving with a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.560
 only part quotes as a file or as 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.660
 a little model in an idea and good 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.950
 Well I'm at a point to record my 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.510
 third material my third disc 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 hello I'm vall or I recorded a record of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.510
 guided meditations here 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.120
 toni the disc is part of the material that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.470
 now used teaching materials to 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.240
 teach dedication 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.730
 so that people 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.250
 is going to concentrate on wetting the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.040
 this album the album was wonderful 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.900
 we had to make adjustments but the truth 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.159
 we do not limit ourselves to the time of recording 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.250
 the music the voice the times all the 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 details on is very important in a 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.739
 meditation disc that there is silence and 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.750
 that was achieved enough also then I 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.019

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.680
 but we are left with tonic we know that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.680

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.189
 our doors we did not know what 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.229
 that was to enter a studio with Tony 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.669
 outside first time we wanted that to 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.800
 beginning we arrived and we felt that way 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.949
 like a little 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.539
 fearful timid but they look like 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.300
 very attentive and in a way 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.520
 very professional now I do not like 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.630

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.400
 here with tony has lost very several 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.510
 things for example one of them was 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.880
 they assemble same songs that we attract 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.030

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.370
 production like saccharin also the 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.710
