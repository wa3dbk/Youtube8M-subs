 you were married by the music school that decided. to produce it then his own 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.200
 of music the organizer now. of honor 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.040
 the master cerniglia 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.600
 he is the artistic director 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.649
 there are many collaborators 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.889
 it is because we have said that your functions among others are those of 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.920
 section manager in italy queue before the body of the house 

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.479
 young people talk about kids so young quality cover and how they are 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.479
 divided from the point of view of the tools 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.889
 the orchestra formed the water town about a hundred e101 this year 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.059
 3 boys theme not condoned from 6 to 16 years 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.429
 a very large boy, we have not decided to leave him because 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.310
 to give the opportunity all these young girls d 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.400
 approaching a real symphony orchestra indeed beautiful by 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.099
 this orchestra and that gives the possibility to all boys films

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.959
 ladder. musical afternoons 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.239
 It is important to also say that it is something that does not make sense to our territory 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.290
 sum is one 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.149
 uniqueness 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149
 yes it creates a mico we say as a project 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.439
 we want to exaggerate, I would say almost in Italy because why 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:02.719
 fr tender. all these guys this person I don't have synchronized text 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.040
 these guys come from very different stories, they're not all students 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.519
 the cantù music school is only a small part of it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.829
 they recognize music 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.019
 and come from the province of Como 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.069
 varese read also from the canton ticino to someone from the province of milan 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.130
 there are all yeast teachers of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.880
 for private individuals and accidents privately 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 someone html music schools someone from the conservatory 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.719
 key int 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.729
 everyone joins next. once a year normally the week 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.410
 before the schools start 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.649
 waters have freed themselves so even to inaugurate it has not 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.669
 school year 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.969
 and they are all here together to make symphonic music so beautiful that it is 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:48.469
 offers 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.249
 well definitely an experience 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.779
 artistic as we have said because mpa are compared to those that 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:58.219
 these are the musical realities of the greatest masters ever seen 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.499
 what is a human experience 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.749
 because the boys meet are boys of it very maria but what it is 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:09.869
 therefore the baggage that they bring home which the experiences they betray 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.529
 ready for me as far as the stars of the sky meanwhile 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.379
 me guys go to 9 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.259
 to 16 years of various and various levels from the second year who does not know the year of 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.540
 limoncello for tweets 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.229
 very important 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.090
 having a small boy has a second grade 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.290
 spagna al cantuccio is flanked by a boy of 16 at the sixth level 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.180
 of cello 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 have these two levels these two experiences 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:40.949
 next 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.789
 it's a lot we will tell the duke photo on the level. human practical level 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.279
 friendships definitely friendships n 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.770
 in my opinion you can especially say the guys called music don't say moon 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 a feeling 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.150
 in particular in the reds of the desires this experience syphilis is seen 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.449
 lot 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.659
 I wanted to ask you house because we mentioned it but it was not said 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.919
 how many are the inscriptions inside the orchestra therefore the head 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.960
 formed intrinsic limit law michelini for canning there are two 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.400
 teachers following 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.120
 these two faces are the first seconds of rimini, there are the violas cession of roncelli 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.699
 regarding some stringed instruments 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.599
 then there are the wind instruments 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.089
 wind instruments and percussion 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.339
 and here are the teachers just 20 years old 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.719
 so steven this section we can also say that the baggage 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.270
 personal artistic hand surely the patana falls boys but you too because 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:40.620
 in the tests 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.570
 in short, there are those responsible within each sea thomson 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.699
 experiences that also pass on to us as a teacher teacher 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.979
 I think this relationship is a fantastic experience that is among teachers 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.589
 france signers 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.689
 in the various sections for wii u n'experience 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.689
 van gaal really from living and was furnished 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:04.219
 life to recommend safe tracks to recommend 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:10.179
 for now I thank giorgio molteni coordinator of the youth head e 

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.919
