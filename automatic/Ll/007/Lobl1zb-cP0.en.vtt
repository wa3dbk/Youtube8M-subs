00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:11.599
 rush madoff to very good androids and 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.849
 miguel and this is all supplied in 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.369
 this video I bring you three shooter games 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.930
 online and free for android las 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.000
 general characteristics of the three is 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.880
 that all three are in third person are 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.730
 online are free and the disadvantages 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.730
 What it has is that the user who pays 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.610
 note a lot in the weapons that the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.890
 three are you can buy extra things 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.949
 and let's see the first the first one 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.500
 call respawn neighbors or answer 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.820
 talk as you want to call it good this 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.949
 game has the advantage that it has 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.629
 missions that do not need to be 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.969
 connected to the internet for example 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.010
 sometimes kill three enemies and they give you 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.530
 money to buy more weapons too 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.289
 we can make friends with a facebook and 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.760
 multiplayer entered into a server I 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.649
 I'm from the blue team and we're going to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.350
 face against the red team the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.179
 trejos can be played by teams all 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.220
 against everyone and in the second I'm going to 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.020
 show has other game modes but 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.790
 well let's see what these games that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.930
 I bring you are they are going to require 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.480
 pretty graphics 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.490
 3d environments that we are seeing is not 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.340
 question that is very noticeable when a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.200
 user pays as I said before because 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.030
 has some spectacular weapons 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.789
 let's see if we find some 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.979
 enemy to see if we can kill him 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.619
 we can shoot rats when we shoot 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.520
 treated for example the shrapnel now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.520
 yes we have to see yes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.880
 you see that you have better weapons than 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.409
 we therefore do not burst the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.719
 ass 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.679
 you have found some of us killed 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.359
 someone and we end this week 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.979
 again the same will go what I have 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.079
 said before who who pays has better 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.560
 weapons and it shows quite in the three 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.690
 games the truth 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.320
 to follow 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 to see yes 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 to die is also that we are at the level 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.760
 more basic so as we go 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.770
 getting levels we will also go 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.229
 getting better weapons with the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.840
 consequential improvement of points and good 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.210
 let's move on to the next game this 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.820
 I think you'll know everything and it's satocÃ¡n 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.590
 dead zone this game is in spanish and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.520
 we can buy a lot of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.160
 improvements 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.630
 we see that almost no free gold we can 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.580
 download apps and get 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.620
 free gold which does not help enough 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 to get decent weapons because the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.890
 that touch us at the beginning of the game 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.620
 how the three games are pretty bad 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.690
 we go to the death game when 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 we got level 4 unlocked another 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.180
 so that area of death as and good is 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.830
 game that I find the fastest 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.819
 servers here we can shoot 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.780
 recharge and run or roll 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.780
 love is bread 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.650
 and here they will also kill me because I am a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.650
 so much fool 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.210
 that is, we water, we arrived a little more 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.430
 high 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.209
 the egg roll 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.209
 it is question 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.280
 this would be like the most the most but the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.220
 others are a little more the graphics of 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.870
 this are more realistic 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.590
 but also the players are more 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.590
 deadly 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 help to kill a worm but help 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.470
 to kill me 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.440
 This has been used big blue we will 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.810
 move on to the next 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.990
 and last but not least 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.730
 important we have going to serve the game 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.410
 of the funniest of the three that I've 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.800
 said as we will see below 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.700
 we have nine or are among those to choose 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.700
 as we will see below 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.629
 and we see that we have already started the game 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.540
 look at this we have to attack body 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.610
 body and to attack in the distance we 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.360
 we found a blue bear because we are 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.360
 on the red team 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.980
 how 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.680
 this when we meet with friends 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 we can go much better because these 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.470
 our partners do not help a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.130
 shit we see that we are not shooting at 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.730
 point and do not die 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.730
 by the owner 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.390
 Bogota 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.850
 all 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.010
 well that was quite entertaining me 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.990
 the 3 personally the one I like the most 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.030
 so I invite you to try all three and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.570
 that you tell me what are the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.570
 it seems better 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.940
 I'm going to remove some of our ball 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.699
 we have won 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.349
 I killed more I kill 5 times the typical and 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.270
 good androids I hope that I have 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.219
 liked the online games and if it has 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.080
 liked leaving a like and tell me if 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.300
 you want other videos of online games 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.729
 with whom to play with your friend and 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.919
 well this has been all passed through my 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.289
 playlists add me in 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.120

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.389
 has been all androids until next 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.389
 video
