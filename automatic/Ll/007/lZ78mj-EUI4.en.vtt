it will be fully charged it will be
green<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.600> while<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> butter<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
green down here while the butter is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.090 
green down here while the butter is
being<00:01:31.560> charged<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.560> availability<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
being charged you have a availability to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.530 
being charged you have a availability to
check<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> status<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> charge<00:01:37.439> after

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
check the status of the charge after

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.499 
check the status of the charge after
approximately<00:01:39.540> 10<00:01:39.869> hours<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> charging<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
approximately 10 hours of charging I can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
approximately 10 hours of charging I can
finally<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.610> green<00:01:45.090> light<00:01:46.759> flashing

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
finally see the green light flashing

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
finally see the green light flashing
that<00:01:47.939> means<00:01:48.000> fully<00:01:48.689> charged<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.530> also

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that means fully charged we can also

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.700 
that means fully charged we can also
check<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.329> percentage<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.320> charge

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
check what is the percentage of charge

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
check what is the percentage of charge
and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:54.290> 100%<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> indicates<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and it's 100% so it indicates that the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.499 
and it's 100% so it indicates that the
battery<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.990> fully<00:01:58.590> charged<00:01:59.159> finally<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.210> what

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
battery is fully charged finally so what

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
battery is fully charged finally so what
I<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.079> basically<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.829> disconnect<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
I can do basically is disconnect the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.109 
I can do basically is disconnect the
charger<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.140> source<00:02:07.129> after<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.640> can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
charger from the source after that I can

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.020 
charger from the source after that I can
remove<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.020> clamps

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
remove the clamps

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.570 
remove the clamps
that<00:02:13.030> means<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.750> battery<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.500> finally<00:02:15.400> ready

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
that means this battery is finally ready

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.809 
that means this battery is finally ready
to<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:16.030> installed<00:02:16.450> back<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> vehicle<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.130> I
