00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
questions that we have about that in
this<00:01:19.259> episode<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.979> didn't<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.490> me<00:01:20.700> leo<00:01:20.880> dolls

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170 
this episode we didn't see me leo dolls
and<00:01:21.360> ban<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.650> Archer<00:01:23.150> none<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and ban a lot same for Archer none of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
and ban a lot same for Archer none of
that<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.900> episode<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.280> will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that in this episode so that will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
that in this episode so that will
probably<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.750> next<00:01:27.930> episode<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
probably be not the next episode but I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
probably be not the next episode but I
episode<00:01:28.799> after<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> am<00:01:30.329> thinking

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
episode after that because I am thinking

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
episode after that because I am thinking
that<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> next<00:01:31.500> episode<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> all

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that the next episode is going to be all

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
that the next episode is going to be all
about<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.659> past<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.350> probably

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
about the past and there's probably

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
about the past and there's probably
nothing<00:01:34.770> gonna<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> happening

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

questions you know it's it's a lot a lot
of<00:03:31.599> questions<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:32.349> I<00:03:32.620> did<00:03:33.069> like<00:03:33.280> kind<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.299> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
of questions but I did like kind of the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.990 
of questions but I did like kind of the
back<00:03:35.109> story<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:35.739> Dre<00:03:35.980> fizz<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.370> Hendrickson

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
back story with Dre fizz and Hendrickson

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.059 
back story with Dre fizz and Hendrickson
because<00:03:37.299> we<00:03:37.419> did<00:03:37.599> get<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.379> little<00:03:38.680> bit<00:03:38.859> out

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
because we did get that a little bit out

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.520 
because we did get that a little bit out
of<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.569> interesting<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.260> see

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
of that and that was interesting to see

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.220 
of that and that was interesting to see
so<00:03:41.950> maybe<00:03:42.250> something<00:03:42.940> else<00:03:43.120> still<00:03:43.780> happened

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
so maybe something else still happened

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.629 
so maybe something else still happened
in<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.379> past<00:03:44.560> with<00:03:44.709> those<00:03:44.980> two<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.400> well

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
in the past with those two as well

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.210 
in the past with those two as well
because<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:47.199> know<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.709> don't<00:03:47.829> know<00:03:48.069> I<00:03:48.099> just

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
because you know I don't know I just

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.670 
because you know I don't know I just
don't<00:03:48.639> trust<00:03:48.879> it<00:03:49.329> neither<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.989> them<00:03:50.199> but<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.560> I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
don't trust it neither of them but if I

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.800 
don't trust it neither of them but if I
have<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.889> choose<00:03:50.919> henriksen<00:03:51.910> or<00:03:52.060> trayvis<00:03:52.569> i

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
have to choose henriksen or trayvis i

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.740 
have to choose henriksen or trayvis i
would<00:03:53.530> pick<00:03:53.709> Dreyfus<00:03:54.310> because<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.970> think<00:03:55.480> he

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
would pick Dreyfus because I I think he

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.409 
would pick Dreyfus because I I think he
I<00:03:55.989> don't<00:03:56.889> know<00:03:57.069> I<00:03:57.129> think<00:03:57.400> he's<00:03:57.519> more<00:03:57.699> realistic

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
I don't know I think he's more realistic

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.270 
I don't know I think he's more realistic
than<00:03:58.449> Hendrickson<00:03:59.260> Hendrix<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.769> just<00:03:59.980> wants

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
than Hendrickson Hendrix and just wants

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.020 
than Hendrickson Hendrix and just wants
the<00:04:00.310> whole<00:04:00.639> demon<00:04:01.180> stuff<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.019> go<00:04:02.199> on<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.030> yeah

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the whole demon stuff to go on and yeah

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.789 
the whole demon stuff to go on and yeah
it<00:04:04.449> seems<00:04:04.810> like<00:04:04.900> he<00:04:05.139> doesn't<00:04:05.169> have<00:04:05.560> feelings

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
it seems like he doesn't have feelings

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.830 
it seems like he doesn't have feelings
at<00:04:06.129> all<00:04:06.160> either<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.849> Rafe<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.480> actually

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
at all either and Rafe is it actually

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.460 
at all either and Rafe is it actually
feels<00:04:08.530> like<00:04:08.829> he<00:04:09.010> does<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:10.540> emotions<00:04:11.169> and

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
feels like he does have emotions and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.069 
feels like he does have emotions and
like<00:04:11.650> some<00:04:11.949> other<00:04:12.160> nights<00:04:12.879> when<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.750> comes<00:04:13.930> to

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
like some other nights when it comes to

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.869 
like some other nights when it comes to
the<00:04:14.199> fights<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.709> thought<00:04:14.919> they<00:04:15.069> were<00:04:15.190> very<00:04:15.370> epic

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
the fights I thought they were very epic

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.310 
the fights I thought they were very epic
though<00:04:16.090> at<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.510> beginning<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.900> had<00:04:17.019> that

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
though at the beginning we had that

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.449 
though at the beginning we had that
whole<00:04:17.500> fight<00:04:17.829> with<00:04:18.160> houses<00:04:18.789> and<00:04:19.709> Geeta<00:04:20.709> versus

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
whole fight with houses and Geeta versus

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.730 
whole fight with houses and Geeta versus
the<00:04:21.609> other<00:04:21.639> ones<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.599> combined<00:04:23.530> attack

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
the other ones and that combined attack

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.070 
the other ones and that combined attack
with<00:04:24.219> tornado<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.030> bombs<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.599> was<00:04:25.810> pretty

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
with tornado and a bombs that was pretty

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.360 
with tornado and a bombs that was pretty
awesome<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.710> see

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
awesome to see

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.640 
awesome to see
although<00:04:27.699> it<00:04:27.970> didn't<00:04:28.300> do<00:04:28.449> anything<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.229> them<00:04:29.380> I

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
although it didn't do anything to them I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.680 
although it didn't do anything to them I
taught<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.280> would<00:04:30.550> at<00:04:30.820> least<00:04:31.030> hurt<00:04:31.360> them<00:04:31.570> a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
taught it would at least hurt them a

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.350 
taught it would at least hurt them a
little<00:04:31.720> bit<00:04:32.260> but<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:33.100> only<00:04:33.280> heard<00:04:33.729> Jericho

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
little bit but it only heard Jericho

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.540 
little bit but it only heard Jericho
from<00:04:34.720> us<00:04:34.870> for<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.080> could<00:04:35.320> see<00:04:35.530> any<00:04:35.680> help<00:04:36.100> remain

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
Dreyfuss were all right it didn't even

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.680

have a scratch I felt kind of bad for
Jericho<00:04:41.320> though<00:04:41.680> because<00:04:41.979> she<00:04:42.639> is<00:04:42.729> just

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
Jericho though because she is just

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.790 
Jericho though because she is just
losing<00:04:43.240> her<00:04:43.600> friends<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.290> she<00:04:44.350> doesn't

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
losing her friends and she doesn't

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920 
losing her friends and she doesn't
realize<00:04:44.949> what<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.550> good<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.150> bad<00:04:46.180> side<00:04:46.660> is

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
realize what a good and a bad side is

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.770 
realize what a good and a bad side is
and<00:04:47.260> what<00:04:47.740> exactly<00:04:47.889> happened<00:04:48.760> so<00:04:48.970> I'm<00:04:49.240> kind<00:04:49.690> of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
and what exactly happened so I'm kind of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.379 
and what exactly happened so I'm kind of
hoping<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.260> Jericho<00:04:50.770> will<00:04:50.979> go<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:52.180> side

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
hoping that Jericho will go to the side

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.420 
hoping that Jericho will go to the side
of<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.720> seven<00:04:53.020> deadly<00:04:53.050> sins<00:04:53.500> as<00:04:53.740> well<00:04:53.949> if<00:04:54.250> she
