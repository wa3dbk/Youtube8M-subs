00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
easy way to close it if it's not already

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.410 
easy way to close it if it's not already
obvious<00:00:09.690> there's<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.380> red<00:00:10.650> pull<00:00:10.950> handle

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
obvious there's this red pull handle

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
obvious there's this red pull handle
pull<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.570> down<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.000> lower

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
pull that down and then you can lower

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
pull that down and then you can lower
your<00:00:21.420> door<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> garage<00:00:25.619> door<00:00:25.980> down

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
your door now with the garage door down

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
your door now with the garage door down
you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.060> actually<00:00:27.240> loop<00:00:27.689> something<00:00:28.050> through

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you can actually loop something through

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
you can actually loop something through
that<00:00:29.240> hole<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.840> rail<00:00:31.109> by<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.430> wheel<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that hole on the rail by that wheel and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.830 
that hole on the rail by that wheel and
that<00:00:34.340> will<00:00:35.340> block<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> garage<00:00:36.180> door<00:00:36.540> from

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that will block the garage door from

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.889 
that will block the garage door from
opening<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.469> again<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.719> can

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
opening up again so that way you can

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
opening up again so that way you can
lock<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> best<00:00:41.670> solution

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
lock it it's not the best solution

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
lock it it's not the best solution
