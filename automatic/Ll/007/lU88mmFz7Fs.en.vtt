00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.779
 at 1 she will be one of the forty-one competitor to claim under 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.590
 european champion next week helsinki and candice didier deschamps 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.990
 child prodigy of French skating already has a solid experience of these 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.069
 big appointments 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.449
 in 2003 she was only 14 years old when she rose to the top of the hierarchy 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.970
 hexagonal junior champion of France of all time we went 

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:24.039
 quickly propelled into the highly competitive world of skating a career 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.029
 early to be followed by a desert crossing back to the most 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 high level last December on the young woman to mature 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.190
 when I was young I was not thinking what I was told to do 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.200
 and percent and I learn is not at all the competition 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 the cities in doha envisioned is much tighter 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580
 understood what it was actually the competition and I lost a bit 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.790
 confidence in myself 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.960
 the lack of confidence the achilles heel of candidates 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.390
 the skater has many assets to shine in this discipline is 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.770
 the title of both technical and artistic skills 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.720
 an extraordinary physique a silhouette 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 an explosive and a rotating society 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 which allows him to do all types of leather 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.650
 it's 12 13 years old she has a lot of willpower 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 e but there not always confidence in his means in his abilities 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.950
 a lack of confidence and that will have to be overcome to make room for 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.980
 top of the European hierarchy 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.320
 next week 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.910
 I still do that I made eight delegates n ya ni and make good 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:28.960
 scores and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.670
 with good scores in general 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 the results follow the goal even if 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 victory and know it because we've been talking about it since this summer 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.880
 it's giving in ten in the top ten for good and simple 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.350
 reason that it is important and in addition it is a second blow of heart for the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.950
 France next year 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.730
 would allow a second skater to be able the european champion 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.020
 now it's quite a director 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 what championships of Europe and the not of an exceptional level 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.790
 but now you have to do that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.570
 but in its place in the ten 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 it's a goal the sarkozy candidate will have to wait a bit 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.260
 of his performance at the European Sales Championships largely his 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.359
 participation in the world championship 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.680

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.720
 at the end of the week
