00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.780

 which a post from the blog who who and taxi 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 with club is that if they told me about it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 like a family and hiking in blame me

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 what do you think of the Italian championship 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.690
 you've seen matches on television 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.760
 get talked nonsense 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.520
 if ex buildings I know it's very difficult 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.210
 Italian football is known everywhere 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.760
 in the world with being outdated and physical and 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.770
 a championship with a lot of great players 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.570
 physical and fought as he leaves too 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.680
 understand the annual ranking yes 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.080
 measure from football and I've never played 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.450
 here and I have faced teams a few times 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.070
 Italian but I know it's a lot of football 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 hard and erect see the presence from 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.580
 jean you played by the principals 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.650
 european championships spain france 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.090
 materials pissed glutea nor that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.760
 English for my style of play and the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.800
 mentality but it is still positive to be able to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 make different experiences like art had 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.620
 in my career 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.750
 cure and I grew up and got the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.510
 possibility to appreciate other environments 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.160
 other lifestyles and other teams now 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.170
 I'm in Italy and I'm happy 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.110
 especially because I'm in a big one 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.050
 companies such as juve reads 22 6 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 meeting to know if it is certain that both the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.239

 beautiful I lived in a magnificent city 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.630
 It was a somewhat complicated experience 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.490
 for the approach to football but I have it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.910
 however much appreciated and I do not regret 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:58.130
 to have a date that you hope 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.590
 champions in our pockets lagani us the yes the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 juventus is a great experience and gf 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.130
 league since she also won and how 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.130
 you know the juventus wants to go on the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.590
 as possible in this competition 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:14.240
 3 difficult to wissing pack 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.580
 we find it hard to gay is one 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.320
 very difficult competition when the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.570
 start and you never know if you will succeed in 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.330
 win it but you have to try it anyway e 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.050
 gangs 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.150
 as a team with the G20s and I believe that one 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.430
 team like Juve has the players 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.100
 mentality and athletic qualities for 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.050
 let us put all our strength into it and 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.380
 energies to bring it to the mill house 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.110
 touches can man so safe other things 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.080
 the statistics said that to achieve a 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.120
 ceva statistics say that in addition to 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.370
 being a goleador you are also a man at 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.910
 kind of striker who likes to count that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.980
 can easily fit into these schemes 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.790
