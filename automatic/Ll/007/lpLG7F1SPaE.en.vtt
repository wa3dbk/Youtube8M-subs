of be able to put them in the right

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.180 
of be able to put them in the right
location<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> love<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:19.070> has

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
location so I love it because it has

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.920 
location so I love it because it has
different<00:02:19.400> shapes<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.030> different<00:02:20.150> colors<00:02:20.660> so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
different shapes and different colors so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.840 
different shapes and different colors so
puzzles<00:02:21.710> are<00:02:21.830> great<00:02:22.040> for<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.310> age<00:02:22.550> because

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
puzzles are great for this age because

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.880 
puzzles are great for this age because
they're<00:02:23.000> really<00:02:23.180> learning<00:02:23.450> how<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.890> decipher

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
they're really learning how to decipher

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.400 
they're really learning how to decipher
between<00:02:25.430> different<00:02:26.000> shapes<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.690> sizes<00:02:26.960> and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
between different shapes and sizes and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.810 
between different shapes and sizes and
colors<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.980> that's<00:02:28.100> really<00:02:28.370> important<00:02:28.730> for

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
colors so that's really important for

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.520 
colors so that's really important for
them<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.000> be<00:02:29.090> able<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.690> also<00:02:30.260> they're

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
them to be able to do that also they're

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
them to be able to do that also they're
developing<00:02:31.130> their<00:02:31.460> fine<00:02:32.120> motor<00:02:32.150> skills<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
developing their fine motor skills a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.750 
developing their fine motor skills a
little<00:02:33.080> bit<00:02:33.200> better<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.830> they're<00:02:34.310> walking

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
little bit better and they're walking

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
little bit better and they're walking
and<00:02:34.970> starting<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.420> run<00:02:35.630> during<00:02:35.960> this<00:02:36.230> period

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and starting to run during this period

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.800 
and starting to run during this period
of<00:02:36.650> time<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.370> their<00:02:38.210> brain<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.570> really

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
of time and their brain is really

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.270 
of time and their brain is really
developing<00:02:39.020> very<00:02:39.530> rapidly<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.190> they're

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
developing very rapidly and they're

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.960 
developing very rapidly and they're
learning<00:02:40.430> lots<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.030> new<00:02:41.210> words<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.580> anything

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
learning lots of new words so anything

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.020 
learning lots of new words so anything
where<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:44.240> can<00:02:44.450> stack<00:02:44.980> stack<00:02:45.980> shapes<00:02:46.400> or

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
where they can stack stack shapes or

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.270 
where they can stack stack shapes or
sort<00:02:47.390> shapes<00:02:47.750> as<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> great<00:02:48.500> learning<00:02:48.830> tool<00:02:49.040> for

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
sort shapes as a great learning tool for

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.040 
sort shapes as a great learning tool for
them<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.120> we<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.920> we<00:02:52.250> were<00:02:52.340> given<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
them so we have this we were given that

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.280 
them so we have this we were given that
given<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.170> my<00:02:54.530> daughter<00:02:54.740> was<00:02:54.920> giving<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.280> for

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
given that my daughter was giving it for

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.230 
given that my daughter was giving it for
for<00:02:57.290> Christmas<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.640> also<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.940> Melissa

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
for Christmas and this is also a Melissa

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.910 
for Christmas and this is also a Melissa
and<00:02:59.450> Doug<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.840> we've<00:03:00.020> used<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> ton<00:03:00.740> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
and Doug and we've used this a ton and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.530 
and Doug and we've used this a ton and
she<00:03:01.040> loves<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.850> reason<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.240> love<00:03:02.420> is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
she loves it and the reason I love is

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.090 
she loves it and the reason I love is
because<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.960> has<00:03:03.080> tons<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.470> different<00:03:03.560> colors

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
because it has tons of different colors

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.250 
because it has tons of different colors
so<00:03:04.130> we<00:03:04.490> can<00:03:04.640> learn<00:03:04.730> colors<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.360> way<00:03:05.510> tons<00:03:06.140> of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
so we can learn colors that way tons of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.610 
so we can learn colors that way tons of
different<00:03:06.350> shapes<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.070> she<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.400> stack<00:03:07.670> them

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
different shapes and she can stack them

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.780 
different shapes and she can stack them
you<00:03:09.620> know<00:03:09.709> according<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.130> their<00:03:10.370> shape<00:03:10.400> but

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
you know according to their shape but

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.220 
you know according to their shape but
then<00:03:10.880> we<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.120> also<00:03:11.239> kind<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.660> mix<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.989> match

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
then we can also kind of mix and match

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.350 
then we can also kind of mix and match
so<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.190> these<00:03:13.370> ones<00:03:13.550> are<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> round<00:03:14.000> runs

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
so so these ones are the round runs

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.930 
so so these ones are the round runs
circles<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:15.320> know<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.620> odd<00:03:15.770> shaped<00:03:16.100> ones<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
circles you know the odd shaped ones the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.150 
circles you know the odd shaped ones the
rectangles

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
rectangles

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.220 
rectangles
with<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> sharp<00:03:19.550> edges<00:03:19.790> or<00:03:20.480> not<00:03:20.810> sharp<00:03:21.080> edges

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
with the sharp edges or not sharp edges

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.650 
with the sharp edges or not sharp edges
but<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> angles<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.760> she<00:03:22.790> has<00:03:23.390> loved

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
but the angles on it so she has loved

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.979 
but the angles on it so she has loved
this<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.400> I'd<00:03:25.489> recommend<00:03:25.610> anything<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.720> this

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
this so I'd recommend anything like this

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.810 
this so I'd recommend anything like this
that<00:03:27.050> has<00:03:27.410> different<00:03:27.860> colors<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.370> shapes<00:03:28.640> and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
that has different colors and shapes and

basically it's a string and you can
thread<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.570> fruit<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:34.310> string<00:04:34.759> so<00:04:35.500> she's

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
thread the fruit on the string so she's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.930 
thread the fruit on the string so she's
been<00:04:36.680> getting<00:04:36.800> really<00:04:37.130> good<00:04:37.430> at<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.699> because

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
she'll hold this and and it forces her

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.100 
she'll hold this and and it forces her
to<00:04:40.400> do<00:04:40.550> these<00:04:40.759> kind<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.090> smaller<00:04:41.479> movements

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
to do these kind of smaller movements

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.689 
to do these kind of smaller movements
where<00:04:42.259> she<00:04:42.410> takes<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.830> peg<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.340> actually

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
where she takes the peg and actually

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.180 
where she takes the peg and actually
puts<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:44.599> know<00:04:44.720> puts<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.979> hole

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
puts you know puts it in the in the hole
