00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
switch what you have to do is there will

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
switch what you have to do is there will
be<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.200> limit<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
be you have a time limit on this and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
be you have a time limit on this and
remember<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.820> round<00:00:48.059> infinity<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.500> still

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
remember it's round infinity you still

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
remember it's round infinity you still
shoot<00:00:49.890> zombies<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.280> 10<00:00:50.430> points<00:00:50.610> whatever<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
shoot zombies at 10 points whatever but

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.729 
shoot zombies at 10 points whatever but
remember<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.110> gonna<00:00:52.289> kill<00:00:52.530> anything

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
remember you're not gonna kill anything

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.389 
remember you're not gonna kill anything
and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.860> round<00:00:55.949> infinity

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and so just because it's round infinity

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270 
and so just because it's round infinity
so<00:00:56.899> basically<00:00:57.899> essentially<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> four

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so basically essentially you the four

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.599 
so basically essentially you the four
players<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.940> died<00:01:00.230> by<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.260> round<00:01:02.190> affinity

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
players have died by now round affinity

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.280 
players have died by now round affinity
so<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> find<00:01:03.690> their<00:01:03.899> dead

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
so there you got to find their dead

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
so there you got to find their dead
bodies<00:01:04.739> lying<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> map<00:01:06.090> somewhere<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bodies lying on the map somewhere and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.359 
bodies lying on the map somewhere and
when<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.229> their<00:01:07.439> dead<00:01:07.619> bodies<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
when you see their dead bodies you and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.210 
when you see their dead bodies you and
have<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> end<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.970> searching<00:01:09.710> their<00:01:10.710> dead

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have to end up searching their dead

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.310 
have to end up searching their dead
bodies<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> search<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.200> will

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bodies and when you search them you will

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.130 
bodies and when you search them you will
either<00:01:13.740> find<00:01:14.549> their<00:01:14.850> switch<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.420> find<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
either find their switch or not find the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.399 
either find their switch or not find the

bodies lying on the ground at once I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.679 
bodies lying on the ground at once I
believe<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.820> never<00:01:39.420> really

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
ground so it was a little more difficult

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.810 
ground so it was a little more difficult
for<00:01:47.939> me<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.280> locations

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
for me so but I do know some locations

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
for me so but I do know some locations
at<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> my<00:01:51.930> friend<00:01:52.259> actually

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
at the right and my friend actually

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.100 
at the right and my friend actually
ended<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:52.979> finding<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.729> body<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.329> had<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
ended up finding the body that had it so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560 
ended up finding the body that had it so
we<00:01:55.229> actually<00:01:55.350> fail<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:57.299> didn't

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
we actually fail that time we didn't

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.690 
we actually fail that time we didn't
find<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> switch<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.649> gotta<00:01:58.829> kill<00:01:59.310> zombies

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
find the switch so we gotta kill zombies

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.929 
find the switch so we gotta kill zombies
until<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.810> max<00:02:01.439> ammo<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
until we get an max ammo then we do it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
until we get an max ammo then we do it
again<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.270> remember<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.619> we're

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
again now remember as you see we're

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
again now remember as you see we're
sending<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.180> stand<00:02:06.659> next<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
sending all we all stand next to the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
sending all we all stand next to the
table<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.489> next<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.539> cannot<00:02:09.840> be

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
table right up next to it you cannot be

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
table right up next to it you cannot be
off<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.440> another<00:02:10.890> fat<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.940> wasted<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
off of another fat because we wasted a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
off of another fat because we wasted a
time<00:02:12.720> bomb<00:02:12.900> twice

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
time bomb twice

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.460 
time bomb twice
before<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.150> 2times<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.540> happened<00:02:15.900> because

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
before this 2times it happened because

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
before this 2times it happened because
we<00:02:16.680> were<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:17.099> not<00:02:17.340> standing<00:02:17.879> next<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
we were all not standing next to it we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.080 
we were all not standing next to it we
thought<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.989> was<00:02:19.049> something<00:02:19.260> else<00:02:19.440> putting<00:02:19.739> up

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
thought it was something else putting up

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
thought it was something else putting up
being<00:02:21.090> something<00:02:21.420> else<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.930> remember<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.379> see

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
being something else so remember to see

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
being something else so remember to see
there<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.950> says<00:02:22.980> nothing<00:02:23.400> was<00:02:23.489> found<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.090> we

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
there it says nothing was found and we

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.059 
there it says nothing was found and we
do<00:02:24.390> encounter<00:02:24.599> body<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.110> say<00:02:25.290> hold<00:02:25.650> X<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
do encounter body will say hold X to

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.070 
do encounter body will say hold X to
search<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.239> hold<00:02:27.510> X<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.900> body

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
search and so you do hold X on the body

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.050 
search and so you do hold X on the body
and<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.680> will<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.909> bit

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.660 
and it will my it will take a little bit
time<00:02:30.269> but<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.349> mean<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.890> gotta<00:02:32.069> find<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.549> in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
time but I mean you gotta find it in

time but I mean you gotta find it in
order<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.970> find<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:34.440> switch<00:02:34.760> alright<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:37.340> we

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
order to find the switch alright so we

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.729 
order to find the switch alright so we
don't<00:02:38.519> find<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.150> time<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:40.019> actually<00:02:40.200> end

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
sometimes in that alleyway where you had

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.800 
sometimes in that alleyway where you had
that<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.250> big<00:03:14.459> guy<00:03:14.609> opening<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.359> get<00:03:15.569> over

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that the big guy opening up to get over

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.970 
that the big guy opening up to get over

to the witch house there could be one
too

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720

that<00:03:51.720> was<00:03:51.840> misty<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.260> don't<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.799> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that was misty I don't know but that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.420 
that was misty I don't know but that
that<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.489> one<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.000> places<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:55.680> dead<00:03:56.160> body

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that is one of the places a dead body

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.400 
that is one of the places a dead body
can<00:03:56.549> be<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.480> there<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.900> where<00:03:58.169> I<00:03:58.319> was

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
can be right there is where I was

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.670 
can be right there is where I was
talking<00:03:58.560> about<00:03:58.709> in<00:03:58.949> front<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.310> gunsmith

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
talking about in front of the gunsmith

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.580 
talking about in front of the gunsmith
so<00:04:01.910> just<00:04:02.910> remember<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.629> will<00:04:04.049> not<00:04:04.199> be<00:04:04.379> able<00:04:04.530> to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
so just remember you will not be able to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.170 
so just remember you will not be able to
kill<00:04:04.769> these<00:04:05.190> zombies<00:04:05.250> no<00:04:05.730> matter<00:04:05.879> how

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
kill these zombies no matter how

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.589 
kill these zombies no matter how
powerfully<00:04:06.690> on<00:04:06.780> because<00:04:06.989> again<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.129> round

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
powerfully on because again it is round

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.430 
powerfully on because again it is round
around<00:04:09.599> affinity<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.609> still<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:12.750> but

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
around affinity you can still just but

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.009 
around affinity you can still just but
you<00:04:13.470> do<00:04:13.919> again<00:04:14.730> do<00:04:15.000> whatever<00:04:15.150> because<00:04:15.750> you're

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019

yeah that's it guys

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.779 
yeah that's it guys
oh<00:04:21.959> wait<00:04:22.229> actually<00:04:22.409> we're<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:22.830> done

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
oh wait actually we're not done

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.260 
oh wait actually we're not done
so<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:24.389> friend<00:04:24.690> sofa<00:04:25.289> who<00:04:25.620> got<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.130> switch<00:04:26.400> he

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
so my friend sofa who got the switch he

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.529 
so my friend sofa who got the switch he
he<00:04:27.900> found<00:04:28.289> that<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:29.130> Yasha<00:04:29.430> end<00:04:29.639> up<00:04:29.759> it's<00:04:30.389> a

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
he found that in Yasha end up it's a

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.719 
he found that in Yasha end up it's a
build<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.900> part<00:04:31.199> now<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.410> build<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.250> on<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.639> the

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
build of part now you build it on to the

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.020 
build of part now you build it on to the
guillotine<00:04:32.910> table<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.520> build<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:35.910> on

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
guillotine table so you build that on

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.219 
guillotine table so you build that on
the<00:04:36.180> Det<00:04:36.630> table<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.120> that's<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:39.690> fifth

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
the Det table and so that's the fifth

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.129 
the Det table and so that's the fifth
part<00:04:40.880> essentially<00:04:41.880> for<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.479> gate<00:04:42.690> or<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
part essentially for the gate or the

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.200 
part essentially for the gate or the
guillotine<00:04:43.590> table<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
guillotine table and that is so that

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.640 
guillotine table and that is so that
lets<00:04:45.449> get<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.630> step<00:04:46.110> 6

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
lets get that step 6

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.600 
lets get that step 6
for<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.130> Richtofen<00:04:47.789> side<00:04:48.979> just<00:04:49.979> remember<00:04:50.370> you

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
for the Richtofen side just remember you

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.640 
for the Richtofen side just remember you
need<00:04:50.759> four<00:04:51.060> people<00:04:51.479> in<00:04:51.870> order<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.169> do<00:04:52.259> this<00:04:52.380> you

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
need four people in order to do this you

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.260 
need four people in order to do this you
need<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.889> time<00:04:53.100> mom<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.940> got<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> place

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
need the time mom and you got a place

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.839 
need the time mom and you got a place
directly<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.139> guillotine<00:04:55.320> table<00:04:55.919> you

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
directly on the guillotine table you

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.629 
directly on the guillotine table you
need<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> all<00:04:57.330> be<00:04:57.360> crouching<00:04:58.199> or<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.220> don't

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
something next to that guillotine table

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.969 
something next to that guillotine table
right<00:05:05.729> up<00:05:05.849> next<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.560> right<00:05:07.560> we're

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
round infinity once again were actually

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050 
round infinity once again were actually
I<00:05:21.990> think<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.500> know<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:23.039> a<00:05:23.070> fact<00:05:23.190> actually

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
I think I know that as a fact actually

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.990 
I think I know that as a fact actually
no<00:05:24.240> because<00:05:24.449> we<00:05:24.750> weren't<00:05:24.930> nevermind<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.099> was

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
no because we weren't nevermind I was

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.640 
no because we weren't nevermind I was
gonna<00:05:27.120> say<00:05:27.360> we<00:05:27.539> did<00:05:27.720> do<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:28.020> before<00:05:28.349> the<00:05:28.470> round

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
gonna say we did do it before the round

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.930
