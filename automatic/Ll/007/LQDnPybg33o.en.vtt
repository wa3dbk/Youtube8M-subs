00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 the components of sports training 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.300
 are primarily responsible 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.390
 for success 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.980
 another house of a team 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710
 during a competition 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.510
 so 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.019
 the training should be the most complete 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.070
 efficiently performed in a systematic way 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.039
 is organized 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.960
 within a property 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 to reach 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 the maximum performace 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.420
 this video 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060
 aims 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.400
 there may be difficulty skimming 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.140
 in context 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.539
 the technical fundamentals of football are achieved 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 ball control 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600
 ball driving 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 kick 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.880
 nodding 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 defense and defense 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 and 5Âª 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.289
 in training the technical fundamentals the goalkeeper 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.270
 currently due to the modifications of the rules must have a participation 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.500
 effective at work 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 today 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.329
 a football match the goalkeeper has an effective ground share that he 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.330
 is prepared for situations that will 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.780
 during the game with this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.060
 should participate 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.399
 perfectly 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.410
 like all other work athletes that technical foundation 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.320
 the methods most used in technical soccer training are in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.610
 circuit shape 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.510
 in form of game in real situation of game and of individual form 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.500
 see in detail the description of all the technical foundations of the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.719
 soccer 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.199
 possession 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.760
 the patient is the foundation of football 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.189
 most used during the game 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.629
 is the very dynamics of the game 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.379
 team success 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.209
 and tactical maneuvers 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.209
 depend on its efficient application 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.760
 three aspects are important for the execution of the palace 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.579
 precision 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.579
 safety 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.719
 precision 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.199
 the base has to be run technically perfect 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.579
 and with direction 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.659
 not objective 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.479
 previously determined 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.479
 1 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.519
 safety 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.419
 refers to the execution of the pass in perfect conditions
