graphic designs episode 11 and today we

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.220 
graphic designs episode 11 and today we
are<00:00:18.070> starting<00:00:18.340> off<00:00:18.520> with<00:00:18.820> air<00:00:19.180> wing<00:00:19.600> mark<00:00:19.900> one

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
are starting off with air wing mark one

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.620 
are starting off with air wing mark one
by<00:00:20.560> work<00:00:21.070> from<00:00:21.340> Qatar<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.180> I've<00:00:22.420> probably

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
by work from Qatar and I've probably

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.180 
by work from Qatar and I've probably
mispronounced<00:00:23.620> your<00:00:23.650> name<00:00:23.770> so<00:00:24.130> I'm

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
mispronounced your name so I'm

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.420 
mispronounced your name so I'm
technically<00:00:24.580> Simon<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.260> as<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.070> can<00:00:27.130> see<00:00:27.280> this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
technically Simon so as you can see this

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.270 
technically Simon so as you can see this
design<00:00:27.760> is<00:00:27.789> definitely<00:00:28.480> small<00:00:28.870> but<00:00:29.740> it<00:00:30.100> is

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
design is definitely small but it is

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.029 
design is definitely small but it is
very<00:00:30.370> easy<00:00:30.610> to<00:00:31.000> maneuver<00:00:31.690> and<00:00:31.900> it<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.010> very

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
very easy to maneuver and it is very

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.959 
very easy to maneuver and it is very
small<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.899> said<00:00:35.109> that<00:00:35.260> twice<00:00:35.530> so<00:00:36.129> yeah<00:00:36.760> I

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
small and I said that twice so yeah I

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.090 
small and I said that twice so yeah I
actually<00:00:37.379> changed<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:38.469> around<00:00:38.589> a<00:00:38.829> little<00:00:38.859> bit

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
actually changed it around a little bit

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.849 
actually changed it around a little bit
by<00:00:39.339> adding<00:00:39.550> some<00:00:40.089> ram<00:00:40.929> air<00:00:41.170> intakes<00:00:41.589> a<00:00:41.710> whole

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
by adding some ram air intakes a whole

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.009 
by adding some ram air intakes a whole
bunch<00:00:42.039> of<00:00:42.190> them<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.879> duplicated<00:00:43.539> amount<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
bunch of them the duplicated amount to

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.180 
bunch of them the duplicated amount to
make<00:00:44.140> sure<00:00:44.289> that<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.589> thing<00:00:44.829> is<00:00:44.859> high

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
make sure that this thing is high

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.239 
make sure that this thing is high
altitude<00:00:45.789> flying<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.479> I'm<00:00:47.260> not<00:00:47.469> too<00:00:47.620> sure<00:00:47.829> but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
altitude flying and I'm not too sure but

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.299 
altitude flying and I'm not too sure but
I<00:00:48.309> may<00:00:48.640> have<00:00:48.909> changed<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.839> jet<00:00:50.649> engine<00:00:51.159> I

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
I may have changed the jet engine I

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.369 
I may have changed the jet engine I
think<00:00:51.609> it<00:00:51.729> wasn't<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.510> think<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:52.870> was<00:00:52.929> a<00:00:53.019> basic

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
think it wasn't I think it was a basic

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.579 
think it wasn't I think it was a basic
jet<00:00:53.499> engine<00:00:53.769> but<00:00:53.949> i<00:00:53.979> might<00:00:54.129> be<00:00:54.249> wrong<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:55.589> so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
jet engine but i might be wrong and so

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.889 
jet engine but i might be wrong and so
yeah<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.859> also<00:00:57.249> i<00:00:57.489> really<00:00:58.269> like<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.629> thank<00:00:58.659> you

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
me for the past none of the three videos

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.590 
me for the past none of the three videos
or<00:01:02.739> something<00:01:03.069> ever<00:01:03.489> since<00:01:03.699> i<00:01:03.850> started<00:01:03.909> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
or something ever since i started the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320 
or something ever since i started the
pre-recording<00:01:05.470> thing<00:01:05.680> i<00:01:05.890> was<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.850> bit<00:01:07.000> worried

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
pre-recording thing i was a bit worried

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.390 
pre-recording thing i was a bit worried
that<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.810> guys<00:01:07.960> wouldn't<00:01:08.230> like<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.650> but<00:01:08.800> it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
that you guys wouldn't like it but it

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.580 
that you guys wouldn't like it but it
turns<00:01:09.910> out<00:01:10.150> it's<00:01:10.630> really<00:01:11.020> good<00:01:11.200> for<00:01:11.380> me

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
turns out it's really good for me

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.670 
turns out it's really good for me
because<00:01:12.250> at<00:01:12.810> nighttime<00:01:13.810> when<00:01:13.870> everyone's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
because at nighttime when everyone's

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.270 
because at nighttime when everyone's
asleep<00:01:14.910> like<00:01:15.910> recording<00:01:16.900> will<00:01:17.320> be<00:01:17.440> very<00:01:17.800> noisy

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
asleep like recording will be very noisy

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.090 
asleep like recording will be very noisy
so<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.810> usually<00:01:20.020> do<00:01:20.440> obviously<00:01:20.920> just

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
so what I usually do obviously just

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.070 
so what I usually do obviously just
record<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.490> video<00:01:21.730> without<00:01:22.210> me<00:01:22.510> speaking<00:01:22.780> and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
record the video without me speaking and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.740 
record the video without me speaking and
then<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.770> pre-record<00:01:24.610> when<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:24.790> do<00:01:24.910> have<00:01:25.360> about

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
then I pre-record when I do have about

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.990 
then I pre-record when I do have about
you<00:01:25.960> know<00:01:26.200> 15<00:01:26.380> minutes<00:01:26.950> time<00:01:27.220> or<00:01:27.400> something<00:01:27.760> to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
you know 15 minutes time or something to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.430 
you know 15 minutes time or something to
quickly<00:01:28.750> talk<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> video<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.440> that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
quickly talk over the video so that

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.040 
quickly talk over the video so that
turns<00:01:32.650> out<00:01:32.860> very<00:01:33.670> well<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.150> here<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.660> go<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.870> bit

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
turns out very well and here we go a bit

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.440 
turns out very well and here we go a bit
of<00:01:35.170> reentry<00:01:35.470> heat<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.940> really<00:01:37.150> wanted<00:01:37.360> to

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
of reentry heat and I really wanted to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
of reentry heat and I really wanted to
save<00:01:37.660> this<00:01:37.840> aircraft<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.590> amazing

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
save this aircraft and the amazing

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.520 
save this aircraft and the amazing
couple<00:01:39.730> that<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:39.940> inside<00:01:40.360> wherever<00:01:41.230> that<00:01:41.500> was

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
couple that was inside wherever that was

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.040 
couple that was inside wherever that was
where<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> combi<00:01:42.550> can<00:01:42.850> barely<00:01:43.090> read<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.930> I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
where a combi can barely read it and I

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.900 
where a combi can barely read it and I
said<00:01:44.230> this<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.350> how<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.500> did<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:44.980> I'm

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
said this is how I did it and I'm

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.370 
said this is how I did it and I'm
surprised<00:01:46.240> we<00:01:46.390> actually<00:01:46.720> made<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:46.900> everything

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
surprised we actually made it everything

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.830 
surprised we actually made it everything
the<00:01:47.530> smashes<00:01:47.980> except<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.490> pod<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
the smashes except for the pod the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.490 
the smashes except for the pod the
capsule<00:01:50.230> so<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.490> design<00:01:51.820> here<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.510> bored<00:01:53.080> d

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
capsule so this design here is bored d

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.120 
capsule so this design here is bored d
dash<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.850> mark<00:01:55.300> 6<00:01:55.630> by<00:01:55.810> Craig<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.260> actually<00:01:56.710> can

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
dash to mark 6 by Craig and actually can

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.690 
dash to mark 6 by Craig and actually can
see<00:01:57.340> there<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:58.659> actually<00:01:59.110> didn't<00:01:59.530> Lee<00:01:59.650> went<00:02:00.610> off

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
see there I actually didn't Lee went off

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.840 
see there I actually didn't Lee went off
the<00:02:00.820> runway<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:03.190> reason<00:02:03.520> why<00:02:03.640> that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
the runway and the reason why that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.880 
the runway and the reason why that
happened<00:02:04.180> was<00:02:04.270> because<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.570> quickly<00:02:05.200> went<00:02:05.650> to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
happened was because I quickly went to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.040 
happened was because I quickly went to
another<00:02:06.430> screen<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.909> was<00:02:07.150> watching<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.600> video<00:02:07.870> on

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
another screen I was watching a video on

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.940 
another screen I was watching a video on
youtube<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:09.039> while<00:02:09.789> doing<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:11.620> come

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
youtube and while doing this and I come

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.200 
youtube and while doing this and I come
I<00:02:12.100> came<00:02:12.280> back<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.550> kerbal<00:02:12.970> space<00:02:13.060> program

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
I came back to kerbal space program

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.850 
I came back to kerbal space program
there<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:13.960> off<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> runway

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
there I was off the runway

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.980 
there I was off the runway
so<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> didn't<00:02:15.970> make<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.540> as<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.870> can

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
so but I didn't make it and as you can

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.960 
so but I didn't make it and as you can
see<00:02:17.020> here<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.620> design<00:02:18.010> quickly<00:02:18.400> famed<00:02:18.640> out<00:02:18.850> I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
see here this design quickly famed out I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
see here this design quickly famed out I
didn't<00:02:19.270> modify<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.660> at<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.350> don't<00:02:21.010> think<00:02:21.160> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
didn't modify it at all I don't think I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.570 
didn't modify it at all I don't think I
modified<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.760> from<00:02:22.120> memory<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:24.250> yeah<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
modified it from memory but yeah this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.240 
modified it from memory but yeah this
design<00:02:24.970> has<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> few<00:02:25.900> problems<00:02:25.990> because<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
design has a few problems because of the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.880 
design has a few problems because of the
the<00:02:27.610> ion<00:02:28.300> engines<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:28.930> those<00:02:29.110> sides<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the ion engines on those sides of the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.090 
the ion engines on those sides of the
wings<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.910> bit<00:02:31.090> shaky<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.980> can

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
wings it's a bit shaky but as you can

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.590 
wings it's a bit shaky but as you can
you<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.520> barely<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:34.000> anything<00:02:34.240> because<00:02:34.450> I'm

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you can barely see anything because I'm

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.480 
you can barely see anything because I'm
fast-forwarding<00:02:34.930> too<00:02:35.410> much<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.250> yeah<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.460> a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
fast-forwarding too much but yeah it's a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.030 
fast-forwarding too much but yeah it's a
bit<00:02:36.640> shaky<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.210> I'd<00:02:37.330> suggest<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.930> have<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
bit shaky and I'd suggest to have the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.340 
bit shaky and I'd suggest to have the
the<00:02:39.640> ion<00:02:39.970> entrance<00:02:40.360> more<00:02:40.570> close<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> body

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
the ion entrance more close to the body

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.550 
the ion entrance more close to the body
of<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.920> whatever<00:02:42.880> rocket<00:02:43.390> or<00:02:43.540> jet<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.350> have

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
of the whatever rocket or jet you have

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.930 
of the whatever rocket or jet you have
so<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.400> design<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:46.000> by<00:02:46.300> your<00:02:47.110> soul<00:02:47.770> ODS<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so this design is by your soul ODS and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.040 
so this design is by your soul ODS and
he<00:02:49.060> even<00:02:49.420> has<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.580> pronunciation<00:02:52.050> written

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
he even has the pronunciation written

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.770 
he even has the pronunciation written
down<00:02:53.230> here<00:02:53.560> he<00:02:53.770> has<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.010> yup<00:02:54.250> dash<00:02:54.670> solo<00:02:55.300> te<00:02:55.480> s

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
down here he has it yup dash solo te s

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.690 
down here he has it yup dash solo te s
so<00:02:56.440> that's<00:02:56.620> pretty<00:02:56.980> interesting<00:02:57.220> he<00:02:57.520> knew<00:02:57.670> I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
so that's pretty interesting he knew I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.460 
so that's pretty interesting he knew I
couldn't<00:02:57.970> say<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.959> know<00:02:59.080> well<00:02:59.230> done

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
couldn't say it then you know well done

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.620 
couldn't say it then you know well done
for<00:03:00.040> helping<00:03:00.280> me<00:03:00.370> out<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.300> design

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
for helping me out there so this design

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.770 
for helping me out there so this design
is<00:03:01.810> either<00:03:02.140> called<00:03:02.620> SI<00:03:03.310> roco<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:04.060> or<00:03:04.390> dagger

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
is either called SI roco to or dagger

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.970 
is either called SI roco to or dagger
wit<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.230> believe<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.650> called<00:03:05.770> daga<00:03:06.070> wet<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
wit I believe it's called daga wet and I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.250 
wit I believe it's called daga wet and I
did<00:03:09.000> adjusted<00:03:10.000> i<00:03:10.030> added<00:03:10.450> some<00:03:10.480> ram<00:03:11.020> air

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
did adjusted i added some ram air

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.050 
did adjusted i added some ram air
intakes<00:03:11.650> because<00:03:12.040> i<00:03:12.280> wanted<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.670> see<00:03:12.820> how<00:03:12.910> high

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
intakes because i wanted to see how high

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.240 
intakes because i wanted to see how high
this<00:03:13.120> thing<00:03:13.300> could<00:03:13.840> go<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.350> how<00:03:14.770> fast<00:03:15.010> of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
this thing could go and how fast of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.760 
this thing could go and how fast of
course<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.600> okay<00:03:17.020> I<00:03:17.230> mean<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.650> could

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
course and it's okay I mean it could

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.800 
course and it's okay I mean it could
have<00:03:17.890> went<00:03:18.060> faster<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.299> was<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> smaller

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
have went faster if it was a smaller

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.740 
have went faster if it was a smaller
design<00:03:20.080> but<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.920> heavy<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.489> big<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.540> few

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
design but it is heavy and big in a few

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.410 
design but it is heavy and big in a few
pointless<00:03:23.440> wings<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.070> there<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:26.220> yeah

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
pointless wings here and there but yeah

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.930 
pointless wings here and there but yeah
yeah<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.410> ordered<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.070> new<00:03:30.100> microphone<00:03:30.670> as

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
yeah I I ordered a new microphone as

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.479 
yeah I I ordered a new microphone as
well<00:03:30.970> I've<00:03:31.630> headset<00:03:32.290> really<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:33.010> good

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
well I've headset really with a good

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.970 
well I've headset really with a good
microphone<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> think<00:03:34.420> I've<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:35.530> watched<00:03:35.830> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
microphone and I think I've I watched a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.160 
microphone and I think I've I watched a
few<00:03:36.100> reviews<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.480> will<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.750> coming<00:03:37.959> in<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
few reviews and it will be coming in the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.640 
few reviews and it will be coming in the
mail<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.830> believe<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.880> either<00:03:40.450> two<00:03:41.080> weeks<00:03:41.320> time

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
mail I believe in either two weeks time

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.990 
mail I believe in either two weeks time
or<00:03:41.980> next<00:03:42.580> week<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.209> i'm<00:03:43.570> waiting<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:45.000> so

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
or next week so i'm waiting on that so

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.860 
or next week so i'm waiting on that so
of<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.690> with<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.260> design<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.100> okay<00:03:48.940> there

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
of it with this design it is okay there

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.620 
of it with this design it is okay there
aren't<00:03:50.019> really<00:03:50.080> any<00:03:50.350> problems<00:03:51.090> other<00:03:52.090> than<00:03:52.209> if

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
aren't really any problems other than if

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.090 
aren't really any problems other than if
you<00:03:52.780> smash<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.260> then<00:03:53.560> there<00:03:53.739> will<00:03:53.830> be<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
you smash it then there will be a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.880 
you smash it then there will be a
problem<00:03:54.400> because<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.940> won't<00:03:54.970> work<00:03:55.360> anymore

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
problem because you won't work anymore

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.039 
problem because you won't work anymore
and<00:03:56.890> I've<00:03:57.880> been<00:03:57.970> having<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.330> lot<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.690> fun<00:03:58.900> with

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
and I've been having a lot of fun with

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.990 
and I've been having a lot of fun with
the<00:03:59.200> game<00:03:59.380> you<00:04:00.010> know<00:04:00.100> it's<00:04:00.430> good<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.790> take<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
the game you know it's good to take a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.539 
the game you know it's good to take a
break<00:04:01.090> every<00:04:01.480> now<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.959> then<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.190> design

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
break every now and then so this design

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.600 
break every now and then so this design
I<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:04.269> believe<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.959> sore<00:04:05.230> go<00:04:05.500> then<00:04:05.680> sadako

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
I do believe this is sore go then sadako

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.520 
I do believe this is sore go then sadako
I<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:07.120> that's<00:04:07.540> how<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.720> say<00:04:07.989> I'm<00:04:08.230> not<00:04:08.410> too

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
I think that's how you say I'm not too

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.100 
I think that's how you say I'm not too
sure<00:04:08.709> if<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.250> made<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.269> said<00:04:10.630> in<00:04:10.780> a

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
sure if it's made to be said in a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.979 
sure if it's made to be said in a
certain<00:04:11.440> way<00:04:12.420> because<00:04:13.420> i'm<00:04:13.660> going<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.840> show

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
certain way because i'm going to show

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.020 
certain way because i'm going to show
these<00:04:14.170> guys<00:04:14.350> from<00:04:14.560> overseas<00:04:15.100> or<00:04:15.370> not<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:15.910> know

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
these guys from overseas or not you know

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.719 
these guys from overseas or not you know
everyone's<00:04:16.329> from<00:04:16.540> france<00:04:17.169> or<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.919> know<00:04:18.040> great

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
everyone's from france or you know great

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.390 
everyone's from france or you know great
greece<00:04:19.180> or<00:04:19.359> something<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.500> everyone<00:04:20.950> sees

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
greece or something so everyone sees

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.070 
greece or something so everyone sees
things<00:04:21.609> differently

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
things differently

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.010 
things differently
but<00:04:23.979> yeah<00:04:24.189> this<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.759> thing<00:04:24.789> flamed<00:04:25.300> out<00:04:25.539> it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
but yeah this this thing flamed out it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.429 
but yeah this this thing flamed out it
only<00:04:26.319> has<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.729> couple<00:04:27.789> radial<00:04:28.629> air<00:04:28.840> intakes<00:04:29.289> i

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
only has a couple radial air intakes i

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.490 
only has a couple radial air intakes i
believe<00:04:29.650> about<00:04:29.800> four<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.020> let's<00:04:32.020> see<00:04:32.259> if<00:04:32.289> i

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
believe about four and let's see if i

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.260 
believe about four and let's see if i
actually<00:04:32.650> save<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.310> Cobell<00:04:33.639> for<00:04:33.789> this<00:04:33.909> design

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
actually save the Cobell for this design

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.909 
actually save the Cobell for this design
i<00:04:34.330> probably<00:04:34.689> didn't<00:04:35.349> I<00:04:35.560> don't<00:04:35.770> remember

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
i probably didn't I don't remember

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.700 
i probably didn't I don't remember
saving<00:04:36.280> him<00:04:36.719> wait<00:04:37.719> oh<00:04:37.870> there<00:04:38.199> we<00:04:38.259> were<00:04:38.349> perfect

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
saving him wait oh there we were perfect

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.510 
saving him wait oh there we were perfect

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
been doing a little rant and things in

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.899 
been doing a little rant and things in
the<00:04:47.020> game<00:04:47.259> yeah<00:04:47.889> i<00:04:47.919> was<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.340> little<00:04:48.460> bit<00:04:48.610> bored

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
the game yeah i was a little bit bored

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.390 
the game yeah i was a little bit bored
so<00:04:49.689> i<00:04:50.110> was<00:04:50.439> playing<00:04:50.650> around<00:04:50.770> with<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.009> Kerbal

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
so i was playing around with the Kerbal

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.850 
so i was playing around with the Kerbal
and<00:04:51.990> decided<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.020> see<00:04:53.199> exactly<00:04:53.349> where<00:04:53.740> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
and decided to see exactly where this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.659 
and decided to see exactly where this
curveball<00:04:54.039> was<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.610> space<00:04:55.169> yay<00:04:56.169> from<00:04:56.800> space<00:04:57.069> so

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
curveball was in space yay from space so

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.540 
curveball was in space yay from space so
this<00:04:57.849> design<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.360> called<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.560> phone<00:04:59.889> to<00:05:00.280> it

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
this design is called your phone to it

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.749 
this design is called your phone to it
is<00:05:00.669> by<00:05:00.819> Caden<00:05:01.479> now<00:05:02.050> originally<00:05:02.219> the<00:05:03.219> staging

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
is by Caden now originally the staging

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.570 
is by Caden now originally the staging
that<00:05:03.909> he<00:05:04.000> had<00:05:04.300> was<00:05:04.629> a<00:05:04.659> bit<00:05:05.289> weird<00:05:05.979> I'm<00:05:06.340> not<00:05:06.370> too

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
that he had was a bit weird I'm not too

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.420 
that he had was a bit weird I'm not too
sure<00:05:06.759> if<00:05:07.090> he<00:05:07.449> did<00:05:07.599> it<00:05:07.719> liberally<00:05:08.050> or<00:05:08.289> not<00:05:08.500> but<00:05:09.400> I

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
sure if he did it liberally or not but I

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.920 
sure if he did it liberally or not but I
fixed<00:05:09.909> it<00:05:09.969> up<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.270> what<00:05:10.389> you're<00:05:10.509> saying<00:05:10.719> now<00:05:10.780> is

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
fixed it up in what you're saying now is

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.589 
fixed it up in what you're saying now is
the<00:05:11.289> fixed<00:05:11.650> up<00:05:11.889> version<00:05:12.580> yeah<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.330> this<00:05:13.419> I

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
the fixed up version yeah for this I

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.180 
the fixed up version yeah for this I
just<00:05:13.629> really<00:05:13.960> wanted<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.289> see<00:05:14.440> exactly<00:05:14.770> how

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
just really wanted to see exactly how

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.430 
just really wanted to see exactly how
the<00:05:15.449> reentry<00:05:16.449> heat<00:05:16.569> would<00:05:16.719> fare<00:05:16.960> up<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.289> this

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
the reentry heat would fare up to this

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.070 
the reentry heat would fare up to this
design<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.340> how<00:05:18.639> it<00:05:18.849> would<00:05:19.060> work<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.960> of

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
design and how it would work but of

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.240 
design and how it would work but of
course<00:05:20.259> there<00:05:20.409> are<00:05:20.529> problems<00:05:20.710> with<00:05:20.860> a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
course there are problems with a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.179 
course there are problems with a
spinning<00:05:21.819> with<00:05:22.449> spinning<00:05:22.900> parts<00:05:23.379> because

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
spinning with spinning parts because

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.249 
spinning with spinning parts because
well<00:05:25.029> they're<00:05:25.629> I<00:05:25.659> don't<00:05:25.779> think<00:05:26.080> there<00:05:26.199> were

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
well they're I don't think there were

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.399 
well they're I don't think there were
any<00:05:26.289> struts<00:05:27.069> on<00:05:27.219> this<00:05:27.370> design<00:05:27.759> so<00:05:28.150> any<00:05:28.509> part

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
any struts on this design so any part

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:30.839 
any struts on this design so any part
would<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.800> come<00:05:29.949> flying<00:05:30.159> off<00:05:30.370> as<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.669> could

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
would just come flying off as you could

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.610 
would just come flying off as you could
see<00:05:30.879> and<00:05:31.330> here<00:05:31.659> I<00:05:31.750> go<00:05:31.930> here<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.379> was<00:05:32.590> just

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
see and here I go here I was just

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.159 
see and here I go here I was just
checking<00:05:33.039> out<00:05:33.219> the<00:05:33.250> smoke<00:05:33.580> trails<00:05:34.169> press

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
checking out the smoke trails press

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.869 
checking out the smoke trails press
spacebar<00:05:35.469> everything<00:05:36.159> decoupled<00:05:36.699> and

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
spacebar everything decoupled and

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.339 
spacebar everything decoupled and
everything<00:05:37.300> has<00:05:37.419> a<00:05:37.449> parachute<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.169> that's

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
everything has a parachute and that's

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.839 
everything has a parachute and that's
what<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.589> wasn't<00:05:38.860> too<00:05:38.919> sure<00:05:38.949> was<00:05:39.370> deliberate<00:05:39.789> or

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
what I wasn't too sure was deliberate or

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.430
