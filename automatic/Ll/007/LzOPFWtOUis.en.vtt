00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 two 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello in this video we will see or 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.920
 Learn how to convert the iPad into a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.690
 second or a third monitor this is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 depending on the workstation 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.009
 that you have for this we are going to go 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 to the internet we are going to open a page 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.960
 new and we will enter the site that is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.960
 called pattern from which we will see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 the application we go to applications 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 we click on apps and the application 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.250
 that we are going to occupy is that of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.820
 yesterday display 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.460
 we click on air display and good 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.580
 here this down gives us the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.230
 options which is what we occupy 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.980
 for example in my case I have a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.980
 macbook pro and an ipad 3 then it would be 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.559
 go to occupy this option but the good thing about 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.800
 this application is that nothing else is 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.570
 available for the system and that subject 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.480
 but also available for 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.610
 android which is good for the options 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.830
 they are vast and not only for mac 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.570
 but also for windows then here 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.119
 we see on the page gives us the options 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.200
 so much that we occupy it for you if you want 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.240
 that is mac or an iphone and an ipad or if 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.910
 you want windows of your operating system 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 it's windows but you have an ipad if you have 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.850
 an iphone or if you have windows and a 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.520
 tablet with android system a machine 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 android if we see here lets you combine 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.369
 practically everything we do not have windows 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.440
 phone mark mccormack mac with windows and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.460
 windows with windows then good in 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 this case we are going to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 work these two drivers we are going to give you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.869
 click here for the application that will go 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.300
 on the ipad we do not click here 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 will send the option to open the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.310
 application and we see that it is an application 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.830
 which has a cost of 130 pesos in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.080
 reality is a very cheap application 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.800
 for everything that he offers us later 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.930
 let's see why and good from here 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.550
 we bought the application and we downloaded the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.130
 drivers for mac in this case the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.530
 you install here is to work the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.000
 installer here is to see display what 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.790
 you install does not have any other sciences 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.310
 next following the permissions and good 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.830
 is going to restart your machine and as soon as 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 learn your machine is going to be this menu 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.020
 available here is the air display 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.780
 now yes this menu does not appear here what 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.670
 only thing you have to do is go to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.490
 system preferences and preferences 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.120
 of the system will appear justly 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.630
 here to the display you just click and 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 you will automatically activate it and good 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.080
 here you give show the explain in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.630
 menu bar so you get all the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.310
 weather 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:58.239
 we close it since we closed it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.720
 now we 're going to go to the ipad on the ipad 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.640
 the next thing we're going to see is how 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.680
 today we are going to open the application now 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.110
 we go to the ipad and well we see that the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.160
 application is already installed in the law 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.599
 of the display this application works with 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.680
 your wifi network then let's check 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.560
 only that the beach the ipad and the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.980
 macbook are to the same network in this 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.900
 case is the name of my network here is and 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.269
 is already connected then now we 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.930
 let's go to the application that is air 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.150
 display we will open it and at the moment 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.819
 that we open it we see that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.730
 they have several options and here to have the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.410
 switch for pc or mac any of that 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.260
 be our operating system we're going 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.640
 to work we give mac and good then 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.420
 here we are going to go to the menu 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.480
 of the air display and here we have it 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.330
 we are going to click and here we are just 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.190
 gives the option to connect 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.400
 we are going to give you connect 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.830
 connect to a device in the case of 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.130
 that your device does not register it 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.190
 you automatically enter the ip as you know 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.100
 the ip of the ipad is very easy only in 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.959
 adjustments you go to the name of your network the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.000
 click here on next and here it says 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.970
 ip address which is 10 point in this 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.510
 good case my ip address we give 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.510
 okay 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.080
 we are going to accept it and we see that it 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.120
 will put everything in blue at the moment 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.880
 he puts everything in blue good he wants 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.550
 say that the connection is made and there 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.889
 they blink a little and now we see 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.990
 as we already have a second monitor 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.499
 in which you can handle it either 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.789
 from in this case taken soto trackpad 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:52.719
 this is where the interesting part comes from 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.900
 for us because good we're going to open 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.790
 reason 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.820
 to do it a second monitor and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.190
 we can see how we move from a monitor to 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.250
 another here good let's hear the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.789
 song that came from fowler reason and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.930
 we see how we can tell from the brand to 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.370
 ipad and the interesting thing here is that it 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.210
 start turning everything into touch 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.210
 we can 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.699
 you can touch whatever you want 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.660
 and it gives you the good option for example from 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.900
 she is moving with the mouse in these 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.389
 move some things 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.280
 or that you move it manually by 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.090
 example all the parameters that you 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.060
 want 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.790
 the traders that you need 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.760
 to move 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.640
 and here we see what we are seeing and the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.810
 options to be able to avoid going 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.800
 moving all the sparkling but let's 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.800
 this we are going to give 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.400
 and well let's open for example 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.670
 massive something that I occupy enough we see 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.379
 how we spent it to stay and good you 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.759
 you can be editing 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:11.490
 practically any parameter that you 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.460
 you need more and as if it were a 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.669
 practically iPad application and we see 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.229
 as you can move what you want and 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.900
 good is something that is going to save you a lot 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.120
 time that will allow you good to do 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.590
 countless things this works in 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.099
 any software that you do not 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.920
 you want in logic in life is on pro 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.590
 tools 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.639
 let's open some logic something that 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.229
 It is also very 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.260
 then it 's very useful because it allows you 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:43.540
 any plugin is rescales the size 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.060
 and here we have for example the mixer 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.010
 and we have a part of logic then what 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.180
 What we can do is load the mixer 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:54.630
 towards the second part and we see here as 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.630
 we have 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.990
 I put play look we can open 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.210
 the equalizer we talk about here 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.100
 and even what we can do is re 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.110
 climb what 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.110
 and well here you have your equalizer 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.530
 we can see any parameter that you 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.770
 want and good are things that are going to 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.630
 leave are very useful things that you're going 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.810
 to be able to occupy all the time and that 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.370
 I hope this tutorial has helped me 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.240
 I am the is the living room and see you in the 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.240
 next bye
