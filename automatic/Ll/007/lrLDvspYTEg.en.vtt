 Until there is ready we will be 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.170
 also bank that that is this much 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.060
 Breaded Japanese is a bread but with 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.520
 technique cutter of grated 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.830
 different can only get or not 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.830
 they want to buy what they can use without a 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.010
 bread bread problem then we are already 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.670
 ready to go to the stove and fry 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.640
 these are crucial here I already have oil 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.460
 hot what I 'm going to do is take 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.860
 this brocheta this will Spoon 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.650
 pass here for the pasta that looks good 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.590
 covered everything is mostly cheese 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.340
 because this is going to help us not to be 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.050
 melt when it is in the oil 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.590
 then we cover very well 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.810
 we took it out a little and the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.930
 we go over the bank and we will give 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:12.280
 a very good breaded as I told you 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.650
 it can be this white or ground bread the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.980
 we take out and we take it directly 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.530
 to the oil that we will not leave a minute 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.380
 and half two minutes we just want the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.860
 bank gets well golden 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.610
 and see, that's how we're left with these 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.850
 things and we're going to go over the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.130
 absorbent paper now well that if not 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.610

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.260
 skewer can make them 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.320

 They have a great time with this pasta 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.430
 then they go through the franc and they are 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.980
 they take the same oil in a minute 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.940
 these are going to be ready they do not need 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.240
 more we will see each other in the same way 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.180
