00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I guess my motivation to build this boat

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
I guess my motivation to build this boat
was<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.650> build<00:00:19.949> something<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.400> was

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
was to really build something that was

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.140 
was to really build something that was
more<00:00:20.670> one-off<00:00:21.560> had<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.740> new<00:00:23.150> more

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
more one-off had some new more

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.200 
more one-off had some new more
innovative<00:00:24.689> parts<00:00:25.109> pieces<00:00:25.580> which<00:00:26.580> include

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the engine paint interior I think we

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
the engine paint interior I think we
pushed<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> limits<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.890> came<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
pushed the limits when it came to the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.870 
pushed the limits when it came to the
interior<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> marine<00:00:33.770> but<00:00:34.770> along<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
engines got so scared of power boats

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.860 
engines got so scared of power boats
because<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:38.940> relationship<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.660> Peter

probably the best best interior in the
marine<00:01:59.780> industry<00:01:59.990> at<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.410> time<00:02:00.619> one<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.340> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
marine industry at this time one of the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.710 
marine industry at this time one of the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
other things that we were really after

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.510 
other things that we were really after
with<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> design<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.590> boat<00:02:03.740> was<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.190> go

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
with the design of the boat was to go

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.760 
with the design of the boat was to go
ahead<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.759> get<00:02:04.850> rid<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.090> all<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.360> switches

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
ahead and get rid of all the switches

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.060 
ahead and get rid of all the switches
buttons<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.130> make<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.300> more<00:02:09.020> car-like<00:02:09.440> as<00:02:09.890> far

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
buttons and make it more car-like as far

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.030 
buttons and make it more car-like as far
as<00:02:10.160> interior<00:02:10.459> goes<00:02:10.870> but<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:12.739> were<00:02:12.799> able<00:02:12.920> to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
as interior goes but we were able to
