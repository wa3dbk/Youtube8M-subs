00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.680 

in<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.730> lesson<00:00:08.970> we're<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.540> continue

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
in this lesson we're going to continue

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.799 
in this lesson we're going to continue
building<00:00:10.290> our<00:00:10.769> guitar<00:00:11.179> I'll<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.599> go<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
building our guitar I'll first go to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.780 
building our guitar I'll first go to
x-ray<00:00:13.320> mode<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.099> kind<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.519> through

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
x-ray mode so I can kind of see through

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.710 
x-ray mode so I can kind of see through
my<00:00:14.940> mom<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:16.250> back<00:00:17.250> over<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.970> polygon<00:00:18.539> in

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
my mom and back over here in polygon in

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.490 
my mom and back over here in polygon in
vertice<00:00:19.199> mode<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:22.020> shape<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
vertice mode I can see that the shape of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.419 
vertice mode I can see that the shape of
this<00:00:22.560> guitar<00:00:24.740> really<00:00:25.740> goes<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.480> so

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
this guitar really goes more like so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.120 
this guitar really goes more like so
when<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.670> back<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:29.910> x-ray<00:00:30.689> though<00:00:31.130> more

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
when you get back at x-ray though more

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
when you get back at x-ray though more
like<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.480> i'll<00:00:33.570> grab<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
like this and then i'll grab this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.340 
like this and then i'll grab this
receipt<00:00:38.000> these<00:00:39.000> faces<00:00:39.570> deselect<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
receipt these faces deselect that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
receipt these faces deselect that
perspective<00:00:40.950> view<00:00:42.620> grab<00:00:43.620> those<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:44.370> ahead<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
perspective view grab those go ahead and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.319 
perspective view grab those go ahead and
extrude<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.300> top<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.550> just<00:00:47.550> extrude<00:00:48.090> those

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
extrude those top you just extrude those

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.730 
extrude those top you just extrude those
up<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.780> way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:20.270 

vertices

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 

I'm<00:01:20.760> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> grab<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.540> these<00:01:21.840> vertices

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I'm going to grab all these vertices

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'm going to grab all these vertices
here<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.270> scale<00:01:24.270> those<00:01:24.570> down

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.030 

to<00:01:29.590> where<00:01:29.860> they're<00:01:30.130> almost<00:01:30.580> flat

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.950 

right<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:34.850> that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
right like that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.370 
right like that
all<00:01:36.500> right<00:01:36.940> standard<00:01:37.940> mode

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.090 

and<00:01:40.759> now<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.060> x-ray<00:01:42.840> mode<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.890> ahead

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and now in x-ray mode I want to go ahead

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.389 
and now in x-ray mode I want to go ahead
and<00:01:44.340> start<00:01:44.759> building<00:01:45.829> some<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> parts<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and start building some of the parts of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.710 
and start building some of the parts of
this<00:01:47.490> guitar<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> first<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.509> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
this guitar and the first one is this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.700 
this guitar and the first one is this
plate<00:01:49.549> on<00:01:50.549> our<00:01:50.820> object<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.289> I'm

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
plate on our object so to do this I'm

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130 
plate on our object so to do this I'm
going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.759> top<00:01:53.909> view<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> I'm

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
going to go back to the top view and I'm

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.789 
going to go back to the top view and I'm
going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> start<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.799> another<00:01:56.130> box<00:01:56.429> cube

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
going to start with another box cube

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
going to start with another box cube
going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> move<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.789> and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
going to move it to here and then I'm

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to move it to here and then I'm
going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.289> scale<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:01.770> until<00:02:02.399> it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
going to scale this down until it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630 
going to scale this down until it's
about<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.119> thick<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.979> I'll<00:02:05.100> scale<00:02:05.460> them

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
about so thick and then I'll scale them

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
about so thick and then I'll scale them
out<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.450> accesses<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.979> reason

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
out in these two accesses and the reason

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
out in these two accesses and the reason
I<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.229> view<00:02:10.530> they'll

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I do this so that in this view they'll

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000 
I do this so that in this view they'll
it'll<00:02:11.400> stay<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.760> particular<00:02:12.150> thickness<00:02:13.010> that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it'll stay as particular thickness that

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.240 
it'll stay as particular thickness that
I<00:02:14.069> want<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.930> I'll<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.110> set<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.709> width<00:02:16.980> on

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
I want so I'll then set the width on

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.750 
I want so I'll then set the width on
this<00:02:17.459> one<00:02:17.670> two<00:02:17.940> three<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.530> three<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
this one two three and three and the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.699 
this one two three and three and the
other<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.269> hype<00:02:21.630> almost<00:02:22.380> going<00:02:22.530> to

other one to the hype almost going to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:33.640 
other one to the hype almost going to
tighten<00:02:23.250> too

three on this one and then under
vertices<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:09.750> then<00:04:09.870> adjust<00:04:09.990> this<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.800> more

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
vertices I can then adjust this to more

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:23.210 
vertices I can then adjust this to more
of<00:04:12.290> organic<00:04:13.290> shape<00:04:13.560> now<00:04:13.770> it's<00:04:14.100> nice<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:22.220> it's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
