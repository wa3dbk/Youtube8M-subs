salt<00:01:35.659> which<00:01:36.469> again<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:36.979> got<00:01:37.100> loads<00:01:37.460> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
salt which again it's got loads and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.219 
salt which again it's got loads and
loads<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.939> minerals<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:38.539> don't<00:01:38.840> get<00:01:39.049> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
loads of minerals that we don't get in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.810 
loads of minerals that we don't get in
our<00:01:39.320> diet<00:01:39.619> because<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:40.009> comes<00:01:40.310> from<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.609> sea

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820
