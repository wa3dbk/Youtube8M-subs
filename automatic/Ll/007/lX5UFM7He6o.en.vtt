yeah<00:00:00.450> it's<00:00:00.659> kind<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:00.989> weird<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.589> oldest

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920

one<00:00:02.100> but<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.429> think<00:00:02.460> Ryan's<00:00:02.939> are<00:00:03.060> more<00:00:03.210> mature

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
one but I think Ryan's are more mature

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.990 
one but I think Ryan's are more mature
one<00:00:03.840> he's<00:00:04.080> not<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.529> sharpest<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.220> tools<00:00:05.520> I'll

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
one he's not the sharpest on tools I'll

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.620 
one he's not the sharpest on tools I'll
give<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.629> think<00:00:08.000> people<00:00:09.000> know<00:00:09.450> that's

give you that I think people know that's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.270 
give you that I think people know that's
probably<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> guys<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.650> he<00:00:10.769> rides<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
probably the guys that he rides for the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.740 
probably the guys that he rides for the
mechanics<00:00:11.820> aren't<00:00:12.000> real<00:00:12.150> happy<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.509> him<00:00:12.570> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
