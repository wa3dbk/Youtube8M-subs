tricky<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.670> build<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:36.320> when<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.590> building

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
tricky to build so when I was building

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.040 
tricky to build so when I was building
this<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.520> had<00:03:39.000> trouble<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:42.480> door<00:03:42.840> because

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.720 
this I had trouble on this door because
like<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:44.190> would<00:03:44.370> always<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.940> popping<00:03:45.810> out<00:03:46.730> but

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730

like it would always be popping out but
like<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> build<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.720> rest<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.890> now<00:03:50.100> goes

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
like when I build the rest and now goes

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.960 
like when I build the rest and now goes
in<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.120> out<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:56.010> yeah<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.550> this<00:03:59.550> is<00:03:59.790> not
