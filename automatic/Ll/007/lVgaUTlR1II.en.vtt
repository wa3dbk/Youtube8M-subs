00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.480
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.130
 a new video and nothing I wanted to explain 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.460
 so what has happened with the road to 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:24.410
 bomber this as you see I got 30 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.850
 0 on the square map with the n 94 and that 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.490
 press the record button on the 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.640
 capturing but do not press it well or 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.079
 something and the game was not recorded he gave me the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.930
 title as you see but you can not see the 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.180
 gusts that carried nothing then what 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.940
 What I did is leave the game like this for 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 that you see the next one and at least 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.250
 that you saw the gusts did not touch anything 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.219
 the streaks as you see I have not changed anything 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.050
 I have not cut the video or anything and that 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.989
 then enter cinema mode and departure 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.460
 I was not in with those who 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.559
 I was playing in the player's channel 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.989
 of each one and neither was the game 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.630
 you see that the game was gone 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.960
 of that 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.450
 and nothing because I was like this recording 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 how many more games to see if it came out and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.830
 that and when I started playing between 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 another game and he thought he was 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.070
 started and I said then I'm good between Ivan 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 04 and many times when I start playing 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.200
 well and I see that there is no possibility of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 get what the bomber is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.460
 I start making heads or something like that 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.840
 and here I leave you with the map that was 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.230
 the next as you have seen has not 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 cut nothing 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.430
 and that so you can see that it had light from 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.770
 response and the orbital that many me 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.630
 you said that those gusts are not 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.620
 could get and it's not like that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.080
 can 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 are streaks that do not kill as I mentioned 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.410
 are streaks that do not kill while the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.790
 streak not mate but you can take out even 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.790
 with the swarm 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.990
 and that already to see I leave here two or three 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.060
 low so you could see that and I'll leave you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.950
 with the other game that I could 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.009
 record from the cinema mode because neither 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.020
 I was recording normally when I play 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.940
 well do heads and all that 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.480
 I do not usually record because they do not come out big 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 games 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
 and that's how I was able to get it back so 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.629
 less of the cinema mode is in carrier the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.849
 weapon that he was wearing is the m 27 that was one 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:30.290
 of the last of the last rifles 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.629
 that I had left to go up now 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.609
 and left me for that about 20 or 30 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.150
 heads as you see I start the game and 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.879
 more pointing up trying 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
 give him in the head what happens that 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.739
 when I'm going to get him I see him in 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.640
 answer already I said ostia I'll see if 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.310
 He tried to pull it out but he did not think 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.260
 make me 78 casualties and then try 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.329
 make heads and that but when I go to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.480
 get it orbital and it comes up 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.540
 says host to know if I take it out because this 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.000
 It's good looking and it's good 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.129
 bitch because I would have liked it that way 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 to take it out on and I would have been 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.519
 rather more handsome but there have been those 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.430
 problems over had thought of continuing 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.700
 so doing likes until I got 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.129
 another but it's a bit heavy the way this 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 against all is a stressful game 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.140
 also because the responsos as you see 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.620
 This is the best area on the map 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.470
 to get the bomber also with 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.260
 the two maps these I've got it 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.680
 are the two best I think to take 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.740
 the 30 0 because they are a little bigger and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.140
 then the restaurant is not like that 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.470
 you can stay controlling two parts 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.620
 more quietly on the other maps 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.200
 as they are in the loop for example as 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.319
 You saw there where I stayed on the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.500
 zone from there that's harder to control 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.030
 those areas and these are these parts are 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.530
 rather longer the distances of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.060
 the response 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.540
 here this one that came with the knife 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.950
 since he was taking out the knife 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.319
 I do not do something 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.169
 and here if we get down here not 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.049
 appear but in a little we go 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.100
 from here of this part in follows usually 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.230
 appear here below 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.730
 and it's a bit too complicated because 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.500
 at the moment it comes out it's a bit and it makes 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.260
 they come out here below the stairway is 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.110
 and here I had the orbital and I already 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.870
 saw means fact that the orbital yes 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.070
 which is pretty good to get 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 this I had thought of wearing it abel and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.560
 the answer alone and thus get more 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.290
 get softer and so could also 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.170
 be fine but with the orbital is that 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.440
 we have a lot more advantage than with 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.210
 a vee is clear 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.960
 what happens that costs a lot more than 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.690
 get but well worth it 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.789
 and nothing here already went a bit like I had 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.420
 and as you have seen they come out right away 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.670
 get out of there I got two or three 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.900
 having the orbital so he shot before 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.630
 that they entered the door to 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.780
 secure low tables and nothing to get 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.930
 at least the answer v and the vy 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.760
 well then continue with the streak here 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.190
 corralling were luckily not 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.660
 I knew a lot when I had the answer 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.230
 we got a lot when he shot 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.440
 and that I had thought about doing 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.540
 another series because this is that over and 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.610
 I have seen comments so you tell me 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.060
 yes champion if you have seen videos 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.680
 other videos that are not from the robot this 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.160
 you will see that I do not play 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.230
 1 game with betis as much or anything like that 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.620
 here you have to trace a little more 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.720
 because if we do not move so much we 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.460
 may appear behind 2 meters as 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.370
 you see all the time like this the answer is 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.010
 in this mode 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.830
 here is the knife again I saw it 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.440
 that appeared and turned and said this is 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.500
 the same again I will do the same 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.280
 and is a run and quite powerful with 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.200
 the m 27 without silencer or anything the other 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.990
 so I took it out with it in 94 with 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.740
 muffler silencer and cylinder head me 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.740
 it seems that he was wearing 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.270
 and that had also thought of making a 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.330
 series because I think I'm missing the 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.420
 Mega titles but as call 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.760
 that the seven and eight techno lows 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.970
 eight casualties or more than eight I think they are 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.160
 those of the seven followed or fast that 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.490
 yes I have it that's why it would be fine 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.540
 because that would be a series like that a little 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.240
 more to sack to get in the 78 casualties 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.910
 I do not know how many are exactly and I think 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.860
 It would be pretty good to tell me in the 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.050
 comments and see to see what we can 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.920
 do because this mode this I've already 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.410
 said that I'm a little tired and over 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.060
 in there being not so many people in this 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.070
 mode and I missed the air as it came 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.840
 of the knife from behind when not having 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.200
 so many people playing in this way for the 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.780
 connections tend to go pretty much worse and 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.050
 I hope that you liked it and even 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.050
 the next
