00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.610
 denot and metro also we care about the protection of the environment and everything 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.999
 what surrounds us 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.099
 for those who do not just compost or how to prepare 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.380
 we do not find with the teacher to have all network 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.060
 that does not pabla to the envelope its elaboration 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.179
 gone precision of it 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.289
 that compose it 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 the compote really a supplement 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.870
 in what we use in mining many people call organic fertilizer because 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560
 it really is made up 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.800
 deep waste of how does each 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 again 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.010
 and organic matter that can be degraded easily 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.390
 so how true is it that compost processing can 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.510
 reduced by 50 85 percent accumulated garbage 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.320
 if you exceed that level because we regularly take a volume 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.390
 for example of gardening waste 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.189
 granma 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.720
 or dry i that volume 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.450
 through the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.729
 the processes that develop it microorganism 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 the earthworm insects all of them are consuming the hilti go then tegra 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.509
 giving that when doing the propulsion of your just mentioned 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.890
 but that's why the material necessary for the preparation of the compost 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.950
 ok, you have papers 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 or to dry jover ama del pvem garden scrap 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.370
 they get everything 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.110
 martino in your yard 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.200
 and if they want to elaborate it in a fairly simple percent and have a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 little earth 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.939
 because that's where they go to such or microorganism goes to the mushrooms and what 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.420
 The only thing he does is that a space in your house mixes everything and leaves it for a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.490
 time it adds a little water 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.900
 you can cover them and leave them several days 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.369
 automatically all this organism is going to begin to degrade 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 and which are they 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.479
 the materials that should not be used 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.219
 we should not know anything to see 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.320
 it is food that is late 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.210
 percent and have bones 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.610
 no food, everything must be 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.569
 shell 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.730
 percent can use per hundred 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.689
 they highlighted the egg debut 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.810
 percent what 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.839
 they have high content of carbon nitrogen 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.019
 mainly 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.929
 of potassium phosphorus 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.849
 but all those food waste should not use it 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.229
 So what is the basic recipe for this preparation? 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:37.169
 is going to have that many people have described their opus their recipe 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.620
 but for us to do it very simple 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.939
 You can do as if 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.379
 comos when we prepare a lasagna 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.409
 throws a layer of dirt 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.939
 what we call toso 20 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.939
 then then he does not throw a co2 layer capable of the verve material 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.459
 then we have dry material 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.299
 we go back to throw a haka pavetto I am 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.329
 and the same process until we practically cradle the feat 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.959
 finally you get a little water 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.579
 the important that you create the environment so that eto'o encouraged you 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.599
 will start to degrade and that's all you have to do 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.080
 that will occupy a minimum space egún 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.689
 in a corner of the patio of your house 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.419
 i there are several ways in which they can then percent 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.679
 the in the north pile of the material 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.460
 person what makes a small ditch and has done it to nobody and they leave it 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.169
 another person makes a drawer 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.629
 but basically it's not going to be nor expensive ibarra going to use letting material is 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.289
 accessible on foot 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.899
 already with that regrets for the preparation of the compost 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.509
 The advantage is that in your same house you can prepare 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.979
 a fertilizer or a supplement that really what compotes 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.789
 you do not have to buy fertilizer 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:59.879
 all nuclei are already nourishing your plant to grow much better and 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.929
 fact is proven in many other investigations what that plant that 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.259
 They grow with a posta blister 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:13.029
 those fruits its growth is much better healthier than with com 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.389
 chemical pd supplement 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.680
 What are the advantages of compost preparation? 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.070
 The advantages are many because first you will have 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.610
 there were some plants is very healthy min with good theban resistance in herat 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.309
 fruit 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.620
 many best 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.610
 percent and growth 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 it's much faster 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.320
 percent in fact it is proven that those plants that are sown using 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.330
 the chemical supplement 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.580
 kisses lake 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.830
 incidentally uses compost 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.860
 some there is a big difference between the two in fact going to get a product 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.669
 much healthier 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.719
 then when was this project started and in college 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:55.869
 this year project is really a pilot project eat what we started 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:57.100
 rounded no 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.559
 four years ago 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:59.639
 percent 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.939
 and the main objective is to be able to develop a series of activities 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.150
 the one that served as a complement to our classes 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.919
 a small research project and may even be expanded 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.580
 what this project serves as a model to other educational institutions 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.999
 the dt 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.449
 why in see what a small space can we can generate this type 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:23.980
 of 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.400
 It depends 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.409
 teacher in which this final product is used 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.820
 the final product we are having 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.710
 oo the 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.919
 precisely as matter 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.349
 for some analyzes in some of the our laboratory course 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.280
 percent 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.770
 we have used it previously as part of the research process for 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.180
 Our students 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.150
 in summer camp 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.090
 what the pra viscerally takes place here in the enclosure 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.680
 those who students 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.210
 he is used by louzán children 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.099
 percent 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.010
 for 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.020
 photo to work him the reforestation activity 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.689
 why learn to plant a plant 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.389
 i the material they use in the compote already mixed with marathon sun 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.309
 then what project future activity of tehran develop essence through 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:15.169
 this project 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.279
 in the immediate future we have an active collaborative project with sebin 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.669
 certainly by that mind 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.069
 that children detectable cancun urban garden 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:27.389
 in the facilities 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.779
 understand the center 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:33.490
 in us then we are going to this high helping the design of the garden 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.520
 and we're going it is providing 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.349
 part of the compost 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.339
 Initially, the idea is for these children to learn 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.169
 let generate compost 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.320
 and eventually for that reason they stop their own oep everywhere 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.960
 So You know 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.319
 encourage yourself to start this project in a post on your blog préval 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.389
 for the first 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.160
 since rodríguez
