adult cat from suckling well there's two

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.709 
adult cat from suckling well there's two
ways<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:14.120> wouldn't<00:00:15.120> know<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.540> they're

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
ways that you wouldn't know if they're

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.700 
ways that you wouldn't know if they're
being<00:00:15.990> suckled

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
being suckled

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.179 
being suckled
the<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.400> way<00:00:17.640> would<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.910> um<00:00:19.070> because<00:00:20.070> they

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the first way would be um because they

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.460 
the first way would be um because they
were<00:00:20.310> breast<00:00:20.580> fat<00:00:20.820> too<00:00:21.029> long<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.260> mom

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
were breast fat too long the the mom

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
were breast fat too long the the mom
wouldn't<00:00:22.859> push<00:00:23.010> him<00:00:23.220> off<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.609> maybe<00:00:24.000> they

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
wouldn't push him off because maybe they

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
wouldn't push him off because maybe they
grew<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> streets<00:00:25.019> or<00:00:25.470> maybe<00:00:25.740> they

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
grew up in the streets or maybe they

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.410 
grew up in the streets or maybe they
didn't<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.279> enough<00:00:26.519> food<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> eat<00:00:27.000> and

didn't have enough food to eat and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
didn't have enough food to eat and
that's<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> only<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.019> she<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.439> feed

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that's the only way that she can feed

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
that's the only way that she can feed
her<00:00:28.830> baby<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:29.820> him<00:00:30.000> stop<00:00:30.240> hollering
