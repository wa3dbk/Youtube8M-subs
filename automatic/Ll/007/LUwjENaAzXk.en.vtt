00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
move on and just start over because of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.840 
move on and just start over because of
the<00:00:18.359> fact<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.949> haven't<00:00:20.400> uploaded

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
in three weeks and this is becoming a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.590
