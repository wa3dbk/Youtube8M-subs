00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360 

so<00:00:00.539> let's<00:00:00.750> do<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.110> blast<00:00:01.439> mechanism<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so let's do the blast mechanism of the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.059 
so let's do the blast mechanism of the
day<00:00:02.550> we'll<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.970> transesterification<00:00:04.069> so

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
day we'll do transesterification so

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.680 
day we'll do transesterification so
notice<00:00:05.370> what<00:00:05.549> we're<00:00:05.700> doing<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.359> we're<00:00:06.540> taking

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
notice what we're doing is we're taking

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.990 
notice what we're doing is we're taking
one<00:00:07.140> ester<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.950> we're<00:00:08.130> making<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> different

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
one ester and we're making a different

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.110 
one ester and we're making a different
nester<00:00:09.360> okay<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.490> having<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
nester okay so what we're having is a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.589 
nester okay so what we're having is a
small<00:00:12.710> concentration<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.099> stuff<00:00:14.549> okay<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
small concentration of this stuff okay a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.720 
small concentration of this stuff okay a
small<00:00:15.900> concentration<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.460> high

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
small concentration and a high

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
small concentration and a high
concentration<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.869> ethanol<00:00:19.470> that's<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
concentration of ethanol that's the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.150 
concentration of ethanol that's the
solvent<00:00:20.910> okay<00:00:21.270> that's<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.140> promoter<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.949> this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
solvent okay that's the promoter of this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
solvent okay that's the promoter of this
reaction<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.269> didn't<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> high

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
reaction if you didn't have a high

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
reaction if you didn't have a high
concentration<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> other

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
concentration of one and not the other

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
concentration of one and not the other
then<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.900> reaction<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.710> an

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
then this reaction would be an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
then this reaction would be an
equilibrium<00:00:29.369> okay<00:00:30.119> there's<00:00:30.390> no<00:00:30.570> favoritism

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
equilibrium okay there's no favoritism

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
equilibrium okay there's no favoritism
over<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.399> other

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
over one or the other

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
over one or the other
what's<00:00:33.059> made<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.750> paper<00:00:34.020> than<00:00:34.200> methyl<00:00:34.649> or

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
what's made more paper than methyl or

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
what's made more paper than methyl or
ethyl<00:00:34.890> they're<00:00:35.460> essentially<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.969> same<00:00:36.210> thing

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ethyl they're essentially the same thing

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.030 
ethyl they're essentially the same thing
so<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.059> step<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> reaction<00:00:40.040> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so the first step of the reaction is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
so the first step of the reaction is
going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.460> sulfuric<00:00:42.149> acid<00:00:42.660> reacting<00:00:43.230> with

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
going to be sulfuric acid reacting with

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.350 
going to be sulfuric acid reacting with
ethanol<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:46.039> don't<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:01.750 

draw<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> product

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.479 

okay<00:01:02.300> remember<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.110> mechanism<00:01:03.770> what<00:01:03.950> happens

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
okay remember the mechanism what happens

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.840 
okay remember the mechanism what happens
donate<00:01:05.390> those<00:01:05.780> electrons<00:01:06.500> first<00:01:06.850> these

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
donate those electrons first these

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:34.800 
donate those electrons first these
electrons<00:01:08.479> go<00:01:09.409> over<00:01:09.650> there<00:01:11.110> like<00:01:12.110> that

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.160 

we've<00:01:35.200> got<00:01:35.409> back<00:01:35.680> now<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.510> a<00:01:37.540> resonance

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
we've got back now this is a resonance

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:53.920 
we've got back now this is a resonance
structure

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.020 

of<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.740> molecule<00:01:55.010> there<00:01:57.850> that's<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
of that molecule there that's the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.730 
of that molecule there that's the
molecule<00:01:59.510> we're<00:01:59.660> going<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.930> use<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.410> react

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
molecule we're going to use to react

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:14.230 
molecule we're going to use to react
that<00:02:00.950> ethanol<00:02:01.280> with<00:02:02.050> these<00:02:03.050> are<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.320> same

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.450 

and<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> electrophilic<00:02:15.830> carbonyl

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
and that the electrophilic carbonyl

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:53.380 
and that the electrophilic carbonyl
Carmen

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.420 

then<00:02:53.990> what's<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.620> happen<00:02:54.710> is<00:02:55.250> we're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
then what's going to happen is we're

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.430 
then what's going to happen is we're
going<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> proton<00:02:56.569> transfer<00:02:57.230> I'm

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
going to have to the proton transfer I'm

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.170 
going to have to the proton transfer I'm
not<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> show<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.250> back<00:02:58.459> mechanism

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
not going to show it back mechanism

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.780 
not going to show it back mechanism
because<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.690> two<00:02:59.959> steps<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:01.490> we're<00:03:01.610> just

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
because it's two steps so we're just

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
because it's two steps so we're just
going<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.060> show<00:03:02.920> okay<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.810> what

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
going to show okay like that what

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.470 
going to show okay like that what
happens<00:03:11.840> next

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
happens next

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:32.300 
happens next
collapse<00:03:14.920> knock<00:03:15.920> out<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.340> leaving<00:03:16.520> group

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.540 

like<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.590> then<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.770> last<00:03:34.950> step<00:03:35.310> we'll

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
like that and then the last step we'll

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.580 
like that and then the last step we'll
have<00:03:35.730> another<00:03:36.090> ethanol<00:03:36.720> molecule<00:03:37.290> from<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
have another ethanol molecule from the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.760 
have another ethanol molecule from the
solvent

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.710 

deprotonate<00:03:46.770> that

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.920 

giving<00:03:54.410> us

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.070 

and<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.890> last<00:04:00.190> thing<00:04:00.490> I<00:04:00.640> should<00:04:00.670> say<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:02.050> all

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
and the last thing I should say that all

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.820 
and the last thing I should say that all
of<00:04:02.500> these<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.740> acid<00:04:03.430> base<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.830> nucleophile

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
of these are acid base and nucleophile

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.800 
of these are acid base and nucleophile
electrophile<00:04:06.040> steps<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.360> they're<00:04:07.540> all<00:04:07.780> in

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
electrophile steps so they're all in

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.780 
electrophile steps so they're all in
equilibrium<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:10.470> what's<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.680> promoter<00:04:12.190> of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
equilibrium so what's the promoter of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.660 
equilibrium so what's the promoter of
the<00:04:13.030> reaction<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.720> go<00:04:13.750> forward<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:15.250> because

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
the reaction to go forward it's because

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.580 
the reaction to go forward it's because
we've<00:04:15.880> got<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.090> lot<00:04:16.420> of<00:04:16.810> ethanol<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.570> no

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
we've got a lot of ethanol and no

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.200 
we've got a lot of ethanol and no
methanol<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.830> this<00:04:20.980> reaction<00:04:21.340> okay<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.090> only

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
methanol in this reaction okay the only

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:32.570 
methanol in this reaction okay the only
menthol<00:04:22.690> has<00:04:22.930> being<00:04:23.200> produced<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.740> wrong

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.250 

which<00:04:33.580> cannot<00:04:34.000> compete<00:04:34.600> in<00:04:34.900> sheer<00:04:35.230> numbers

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
which cannot compete in sheer numbers

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.950 
which cannot compete in sheer numbers
against<00:04:36.100> as<00:04:36.520> much<00:04:36.820> ethanol<00:04:37.360> because<00:04:37.600> then

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
against as much ethanol because then
