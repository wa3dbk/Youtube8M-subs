00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.859
 In the following you will see what happens when 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.430
 I take six pokÃ©mon out of my boxes 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.680
 raussuchen and as packed in the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.680
 fight against challenger send 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:23.210
 I open with joker and the djoker has 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.779
 as was glass blitzer that he once 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.250
 is the habit in the first round 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.390
 basically wanted to change 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.330
 use 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.580
 that is generally a good plan for him 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.620
 here, however, the thunder would be lightning 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.090
 then probably the better 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.110
 decision 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.420
 because then paterno survives and has the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.900
 Opportunity to visit Steiner outside 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.120
 lay 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.729
 Titanium stones are not that bad 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.949
 for me but it would have been nice 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.390
 not to have you to go away 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.729
 One can also survive very quickly 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.949
 Correct for that we have well said so 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.390
 later 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.190
 that are always helpful 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.129
 Priority should always be in the team 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.080
 exactly for such situations the place 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 from afar and meters in and meters 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.630
 Big seems to think it would be fast 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.090
 or strong enough defensively but that is 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.930
 not a case the engine has one 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.940
 earthquakes with step and live and consequently 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.290
 MegagroÃŸ is no opponent for her 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.030
 free round the cytomegalovirus 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.830
 classic status move in the first 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640
 round now offers benefits around tartar 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.320
 to put out 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.360
 So now we have a stone on both 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.160
 one knows that from the opus 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.020
 is almost standard 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.330
 unfortunately, now is the pizarro 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.730
 space active and this tito mega has the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.530
 strauchler one sees this frequently however 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.340
 not always i was hoping he 'll 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.330
 not there but so we have good and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.870
 lost and the pizarro room is 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.610
 not nice for my team because nothing out 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.330
 my team really want in payment 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.970
 fight space 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.569
 the best opponent for doing mega 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.099
 of course cookie cookie is lucky now 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.030
 because google gets a free round 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.190
 through a mystic through omega the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.140
 Of course, psycho crisis was a minor one 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.770
 error and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.450
 out of fear then to be eliminated 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.450
 and to use again later 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.380
 then pulls back super mega and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.330
 even that enters the field and even has 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.750
 What now makes the kuki almost 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.459
 no harm because their cracks 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.640
 need to do harm then so 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.880
 a few times dragon dance or protzer in 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.900
 the other variant with plus minus zero 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.700
 and with -1 you can not do it that way 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 so much do even the other hand, 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.739
 could do something with it but 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.260
 even that uses the fact that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.670
 their ok give also hardly sparkle 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.700
 can do a bit of that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.560
 to use dragon dance 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 Now both have blown in Traun 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.650
 So the trick has ended 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.280
 less harm done than me 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.310
 had feared 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 and that is exactly where it is in the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.310
 Upper hand because of the threatening enough 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500
 the crunch despite a kite dance 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.230
 more than do not garros out to it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 remove 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.530
 but despite the dragon's dance, that's always the case 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
 even slower than the jogger and the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.430
 joker then eliminates very quickly 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.290
 the word change so now after the first 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760
 Half of the fight reasonably fast 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.150
 was clarified we come now to the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.320
 really bad guys or the bad girl 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.900
 in canister now prepares the late game 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.610
 action in front of a light shield and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.070
 then then with circumstances also with 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.470
 a reflector because not protected 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.870
 should be able to open a window too 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:08.329
 survive unless this criticism that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.239
 is unattractive but little light shoulder 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:16.440
 and gives us reasonably certainty 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 lost against us with this jersey 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.130
 Now we have archeology and ethnology 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.220
 is outside and the opponent is easy 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.940
 stronger is why now clearly what happened 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.700
 that could be projects 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.070
 I thought we just go 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.360
 times straight forward with the tantrum 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.250
 because although that is resistant to the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.890
 Tantrum from the field still makes 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.160
 enough harm if that is now the three 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.120
 round would have been good case would be the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.510
 very nice 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.310
 but that's just two rounds 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.320
 good fit and currently gets one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.000
 earthquake from now after I saw 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.310
 that this forward thinker earthquake 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.230
 I thought of attacking preaches 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.790
 I'm the second earthquake in 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.760
 I'm floating on the change of gear 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.510
 but Horst Becker already wanted to 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.930
 blow up the air and the death makes him 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:20.470
 Straight in the face as death must 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:24.100
 nunmal so does the field is now made 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.850
 the death against jersey and super mega 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.000
 Of course you want a change 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.990
 provoke or at least a focus 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.810
 bump who knows in any case has it 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.169
 does not work so well 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.230
 super mega could do nothing 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.960
 against the ice tower and safely behind the 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.090
 The ice-cold death can not sign now 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.930
 yet another time the ice tower 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.580
 unleash 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:57.419
 against troicki lost and then survived 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.010
 in fact the first dark aura 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.540
 now could a second ice storm or 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.950
 entry means to even in this case 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.230
 to clarify the whole thing 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.919
 but death does not make a normal end 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.730
 for this fight 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.730
 because the death accompanied jersey personally 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.930
 into hell and that 's the match 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.060
 then over, I hope it has you 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.290
 please write me the comments and 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.430
 We will meet again next time 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.430
 to date
