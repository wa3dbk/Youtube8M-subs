00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
sure they all made their mistakes at 21

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
sure they all made their mistakes at 21
20<00:01:35.100> years<00:01:35.280> old<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.580> they<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:35.820> came<00:01:36.030> into

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
20 years old when they first came into

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180 
20 years old when they first came into
the<00:01:36.330> league<00:01:36.480> so<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.800> take<00:01:38.010> away<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
the league so but what I take away from

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.100 
the league so but what I take away from
that<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.850> learn<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.660> best<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that is you learn from the best and you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.150 
that is you learn from the best and you
learn<00:01:40.260> how<00:01:40.440> those<00:01:40.560> guys<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.920> carried

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
learn how those guys have carried

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.250 
learn how those guys have carried
themselves<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> extremely<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:42.900> on

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
themselves which is extremely well on

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.310 
themselves which is extremely well on

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and off the court so I think I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
and off the court so I think I

I<00:02:00.060> mean<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.300> days<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.690> little<00:02:00.960> long<00:02:01.110> but

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I mean the days get a little long but

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.930 
I mean the days get a little long but
that's<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.920> training<00:02:02.190> camp<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> think

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
that's what training camp is and I think

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
they go into it with that mindset and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.749 
they go into it with that mindset and
everybody's<00:02:08.040> ready<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.490> it's<00:02:08.670> a
