00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the the material I was doing because I

the the material I was doing because I
by<00:01:17.680> staying<00:01:18.010> within<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.580> those<00:01:18.820> limited

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
by staying within that those limited

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.649 
by staying within that those limited
parameters<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.890> forced<00:01:21.250> me<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.510> deal<00:01:22.510> with

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
parameters it forced me to deal with

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.030

certain<00:01:22.840> things<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.200> certain<00:01:23.380> ways<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:23.680> uh

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
certain things in certain ways and uh

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.399 
certain things in certain ways and uh
and<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.939> guess<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.510> violence<00:01:25.869> came<00:01:26.080> out<00:01:26.200> as

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
and I guess and the violence came out as

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.560 
and I guess and the violence came out as
crude<00:01:26.680> actions<00:01:27.130> boom<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.760> do<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.060> you
