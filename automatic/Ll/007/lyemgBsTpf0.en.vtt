00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.870
 the game is usually an activity 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.580
 excellent for dogs because it encourages 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.430
 the practice of physical exercises 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.300
 helping to strengthen your muscles 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.310
 joints preventing overweight 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.200
 It is also a fun activity for 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.300
 he what avoids boredom and 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.310
 facilitates the balance of your character and 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.200
 What's more, it helps to strengthen the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.899
 link between the dog and its owner 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.519
 without forgetting that with the game you can 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.519
 improve the obedience of our dog 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.680
 We can practice a variety of 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.420
 games with our pet both at home 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.949
 how out of it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.470
 normally fosters a very 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.870
 important between the pet and us 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.790
 we can practice the typical game of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.100
 throw the ball to throw it and that the 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.560
 animal return it repeatedly too 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.050
 we can practice it with a toy 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.000
 doll or with a resistant fabric 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.500
 so that the fact of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 throw it to bring it 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.980
 every time you return the object 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.800
 we will reward the dog with a tone of voice 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.080
 cheerful and praising a caress a 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.360
 candy we usually recommend that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.979
 progressively more with the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.320
 caress that no to the prize because there 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.300
 races that have a tendency to music 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.920
 if we go to the park we can launch the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:44.680
 ball at a greater distance so that the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 animal can do more exercise very 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.790
 all right 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.759
 another game that we can practice in 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.800
 house is the hiding place we make our 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.509
 dog feels or is taken on the ground and 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.670
 we hide behind a door 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.250
 from some corner of the house 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.110
 from there we call the dog so that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.759
 come in our search we reward it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 when I get it 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.750
 with this we strengthen on the street that the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 animal is pending and I did not have 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010
 we can also hide some toy or 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.240
 some candy and encourage our 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.980
 pet to find it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.350
 the dogs love to stretch a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.570
 object to win his opponent 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.400
 They are usually toys designed to 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.010
 not damage your denture or that you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.450
 break 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.300
 important do not lift the dog off the ground 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.070
 while holding the toy 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.780
 you have to pull him towards you by loosening 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.700
 force from time to time to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.350
 stimulate it and so that the dog can 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.750
 catch the best with your mouth and do not 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.850
 slide 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.620
 consult your veterinarian about 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.080
 convenience of practicing this game with 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.700
 your pet when we leave alone our 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.760
 dog we can provide you some 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.320
 educational for your entertainment a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.510
 good solution would be the toys 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.190
 holes in this case would serve to put 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.320
 awards and that the animal does not get little 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.270
 little by little the dog has to move the 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.670
 toy on the floor so that it goes 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.610
 releasing the prizes is a very game 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.110
 useful for obese and sedentary dogs and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.640
 that we forced him to exercise 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.830
 change a part of your ration of 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 food can also help us 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.520
 accustom the dog to stay alone in 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.200
 house since it keeps you busy and 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.830
 entertained the first five minutes 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.780
 of separation anxiety

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.320
