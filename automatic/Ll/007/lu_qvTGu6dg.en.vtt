00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
welcome to this tutorial in this

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.770 
welcome to this tutorial in this
tutorial<00:00:10.070> I'll<00:00:10.670> teach<00:00:10.730> you<00:00:11.120> how<00:00:11.270> to<00:00:11.299> make<00:00:11.540> a

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
tutorial I'll teach you how to make a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.949 
tutorial I'll teach you how to make a
Celtic<00:00:12.770> triquetra<00:00:13.490> symbol<00:00:13.520> also<00:00:14.510> known<00:00:14.809> as<00:00:14.930> a

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
Celtic triquetra symbol also known as a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.650 
Celtic triquetra symbol also known as a
Trinity<00:00:15.230> symbol<00:00:15.910> okay<00:00:16.910> first<00:00:17.360> thing<00:00:17.449> we<00:00:17.480> want

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
Trinity symbol okay first thing we want

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.620 
Trinity symbol okay first thing we want
to<00:00:17.690> do<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:18.410> ourselves<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.800> line<00:00:19.359> you<00:00:20.359> can<00:00:20.510> make

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
to do to ourselves a line you can make

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.659 
to do to ourselves a line you can make
this<00:00:20.750> line<00:00:20.990> whatever<00:00:21.289> length<00:00:21.560> you<00:00:21.650> like<00:00:21.890> it's

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
this line whatever length you like it's

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.060 
this line whatever length you like it's
easier<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:22.970> work<00:00:23.060> with<00:00:23.140> units<00:00:24.140> such<00:00:24.259> as<00:00:24.289> 1<00:00:24.619> 10

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
easier to work with units such as 1 10

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.230 
easier to work with units such as 1 10
or<00:00:25.910> 20<00:00:26.539> multiples<00:00:27.019> of<00:00:27.109> tens<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.589> quote<00:00:28.009> good<00:00:28.240> as

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
or 20 multiples of tens of quote good as

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540 
or 20 multiples of tens of quote good as
you'll<00:00:29.390> see<00:00:29.539> why<00:00:29.689> soon<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:31.070> what<00:00:31.249> we<00:00:31.339> want<00:00:31.490> to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
you'll see why soon now what we want to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.200 
you'll see why soon now what we want to
do<00:00:31.669> is<00:00:31.910> we<00:00:32.029> want<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.270> rotate<00:00:32.990> this<00:00:33.290> line<00:00:34.210> 120

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
do is we want to rotate this line 120

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.950 
do is we want to rotate this line 120
degrees<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:35.690> make<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.870> copy<00:00:39.280> 120<00:00:40.280> degrees<00:00:40.580> and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
degrees so make a copy 120 degrees and

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.040 
degrees so make a copy 120 degrees and
then<00:00:41.960> another<00:00:42.110> hundred<00:00:42.410> twenty<00:00:42.590> degrees<00:00:44.050> all

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
then another hundred twenty degrees all

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.760 
then another hundred twenty degrees all
these<00:00:45.350> lines<00:00:45.590> are<00:00:45.920> now<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.250> same<00:00:46.550> length<00:00:46.820> you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
these lines are now the same length you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.360 
these lines are now the same length you
see<00:00:48.770> here<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.800> angle<00:00:51.920> between<00:00:52.760> them<00:00:53.060> all<00:00:54.370> is

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
see here the angle between them all is

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.140 
see here the angle between them all is
120<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.380> 3<00:00:57.380> 120<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:57.950> equals<00:00:58.190> 360<00:00:58.700> which<00:00:58.820> makes<00:00:59.030> a

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
120 so 3 120 is equals 360 which makes a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.280 
120 so 3 120 is equals 360 which makes a
perfect<00:00:59.540> circle<00:00:59.810> as<00:00:59.930> you<00:00:59.960> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.290> here<00:01:02.290> so

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
perfect circle as you can see here so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.960 
perfect circle as you can see here so
we'll<00:01:03.380> get<00:01:03.470> rid<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:03.650> that<00:01:03.710> next<00:01:04.670> thing<00:01:04.759> we<00:01:04.820> want

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
we'll get rid of that next thing we want

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.550 
we'll get rid of that next thing we want
to<00:01:05.000> do<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.299> divide<00:01:05.659> these<00:01:05.900> lines<00:01:06.170> into

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
to do is divide these lines into

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.319 
to do is divide these lines into
quarters<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:09.520> I'm<00:01:10.520> using<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.880> software<00:01:11.119> package

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
quarters so I'm using a software package

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.510 
quarters so I'm using a software package
here<00:01:11.659> called<00:01:11.960> AutoCAD<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.100> get<00:01:13.249> the<00:01:13.340> same

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
here called AutoCAD you get the same

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.039 
here called AutoCAD you get the same
thing<00:01:13.729> applies<00:01:13.969> with<00:01:14.329> if<00:01:14.810> you're<00:01:14.899> drawing

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
thing applies with if you're drawing

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.830 
thing applies with if you're drawing
this<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:15.590> pencil<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.039> pen<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.630> it's<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.659> lot

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
this with pencil and pen and it's a lot

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.080 
this with pencil and pen and it's a lot
easier<00:01:18.549> with<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.670> software<00:01:21.579> ok<00:01:22.579> if<00:01:22.789> I<00:01:22.880> delete

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
easier with the software ok if I delete

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.130 
easier with the software ok if I delete
this<00:01:23.270> line<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.600> can<00:01:23.630> see<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.020> I've<00:01:24.109> created

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
this line you can see that I've created

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.590 
this line you can see that I've created
and<00:01:24.939> 4<00:01:25.939> units<00:01:26.390> 1<00:01:26.810> 2<00:01:27.049> 3<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:27.979> reform<00:01:28.460> there<00:01:28.850> bring

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and 4 units 1 2 3 and reform there bring

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.969 
and 4 units 1 2 3 and reform there bring
that<00:01:29.719> line<00:01:29.869> back<00:01:30.399> okay<00:01:31.399> so<00:01:32.200> basically<00:01:35.920> if<00:01:36.920> we

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
that line back okay so basically if we

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.800 
that line back okay so basically if we
look<00:01:37.249> at<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.399> distance<00:01:37.729> here<00:01:37.969> it'll<00:01:38.659> be<00:01:38.719> the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
look at the distance here it'll be the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.950 
look at the distance here it'll be the
same<00:01:39.049> between<00:01:39.170> each<00:01:39.530> point<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:43.719> so<00:01:44.719> there<00:01:44.869> we

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
same between each point and so there we

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.749 
same between each point and so there we
go<00:01:44.990> that's<00:01:45.319> lips<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.159> ones<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.460> not<00:01:46.579> quite

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
go that's lips the ones it's not quite

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.480 
go that's lips the ones it's not quite
on<00:01:46.880> they're<00:01:47.319> all<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.439> same<00:01:48.469> all<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.310> same

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
on they're all the same all the same

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.059 
on they're all the same all the same
distance<00:01:49.909> all<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.840> want<00:01:51.109> to<00:01:51.170> do<00:01:51.289> is<00:01:51.590> create<00:01:52.009> an

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
distance all I want to do is create an

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.870 
distance all I want to do is create an
arc<00:01:52.359> with<00:01:53.359> its<00:01:53.799> middle<00:01:54.799> point<00:01:55.039> going<00:01:55.549> through

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
arc with its middle point going through

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.289 
arc with its middle point going through
the<00:01:56.389> first<00:01:56.539> quarter<00:01:56.959> you<00:01:57.939> can<00:01:58.939> see<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.209> this

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
the first quarter you can see here this

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.940 
the first quarter you can see here this
is<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.450> first<00:01:59.689> quarter<00:02:00.219> okay<00:02:01.219> so<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.179> could

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
is the first quarter okay so we could

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.590 
is the first quarter okay so we could
look<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.069> our<00:02:04.130> first<00:02:04.369> back<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:04.909> there<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.509> we

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
look at our first back in there and we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.559 
look at our first back in there and we
want<00:02:05.749> to<00:02:05.840> divide<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:08.450> other<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:10.569> for

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
want to divide the the other and for

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.429 
want to divide the the other and for
a<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.849> lines<00:02:15.290> into<00:02:16.290> quarters<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.709> well<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:19.049> do

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
a the lines into quarters as well so do

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.830 
a the lines into quarters as well so do
that<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.430> we'll<00:02:20.519> get<00:02:20.670> another<00:02:20.790> arc<00:02:21.060> going

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that and we'll get another arc going

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.140 
that and we'll get another arc going
from<00:02:22.170> here<00:02:22.530> let's<00:02:23.250> midpoint<00:02:23.730> going<00:02:24.000> through

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
from here let's midpoint going through

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.729 
from here let's midpoint going through
the<00:02:24.239> quarter<00:02:24.510> point<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.439> to<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> end

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the quarter point and then to the end

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.330 
the quarter point and then to the end
point<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.329> again<00:02:27.329> from<00:02:27.569> here<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.890> quarter

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
point and again from here to the quarter

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.880 
point and again from here to the quarter
point<00:02:29.579> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> end<00:02:30.629> point<00:02:30.680> okay

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
point to the end point okay

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.630 
point to the end point okay
next<00:02:32.879> we<00:02:33.000> want<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.420> give<00:02:33.599> our<00:02:34.579> symbol<00:02:35.579> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
next we want to do is give our symbol a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.809 
next we want to do is give our symbol a
little<00:02:35.849> bit<00:02:35.939> of<00:02:36.030> thickness<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.730> make

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
little bit of thickness so you can make

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.959 
little bit of thickness so you can make
this<00:02:38.909> thick<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.389> like<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.819> just

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
this thick as you like and we just

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.080 
this thick as you like and we just
offset<00:02:42.120> those<00:02:42.450> lines<00:02:43.760> clean<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.970> other

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
offset those lines clean up the other

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.869 
offset those lines clean up the other
lines<00:02:48.530> okay<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.799> now<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.189> all<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:50.700> work

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
lines okay and now with all not work

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.699 
lines okay and now with all not work
it's<00:02:51.269> usually<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.139> an<00:02:52.260> over-and-under

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it's usually going in an over-and-under

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.849 
it's usually going in an over-and-under
pattern<00:02:53.159> so<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.180> might<00:02:54.389> have<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:55.379> first<00:02:55.620> line

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
pattern so we might have this first line

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.460 
pattern so we might have this first line
going<00:02:56.849> over<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.540> goes<00:02:57.780> over<00:02:58.049> these<00:02:58.200> lines

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
going over this goes over these lines

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.369 
going over this goes over these lines
here<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.389> as<00:03:00.389> we<00:03:00.510> come<00:03:00.599> along<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.049> wants<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> go

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
here and as we come along it wants to go

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.420 
here and as we come along it wants to go
under<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.769> line<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.900> we'll<00:03:04.049> like<00:03:04.889> that<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.370> as

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
under this line so we'll like that so as

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.020 
under this line so we'll like that so as
you<00:03:05.549> can<00:03:05.639> see<00:03:05.700> we've<00:03:06.000> got<00:03:06.030> over<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.530> under

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you can see we've got over and under

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.759 
you can see we've got over and under
then<00:03:09.030> coming<00:03:09.269> back<00:03:09.299> here<00:03:09.689> wants<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.470> go<00:03:10.620> back

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
then coming back here wants to go back

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.140 
then coming back here wants to go back
over<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.530> that's<00:03:13.680> basically<00:03:14.189> that<00:03:14.459> symbol

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
over so that's basically that symbol

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.379 
over so that's basically that symbol
there<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.569> give<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.620> or<00:03:16.709> two<00:03:16.739> sometimes

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
there and give you one or two sometimes

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.099 
there and give you one or two sometimes
people<00:03:18.389> put<00:03:18.479> a<00:03:18.540> circle<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.049> there

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
people put a circle in there

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.839 
people put a circle in there
this<00:03:22.109> might<00:03:22.500> need<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> adjust<00:03:23.489> our

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
this might need to adjust our

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.479 
this might need to adjust our
over-unders<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.859> it<00:03:25.949> over<00:03:26.099> here<00:03:26.220> we

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
over-unders see some of it over here we

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.719 
over-unders see some of it over here we
want<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.699> go<00:03:26.760> under<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:30.209> then<00:03:30.269> over<00:03:33.049> and

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729

want to get under with this one okay we
clean<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.139> lines<00:03:55.370> that's<00:03:56.370> basically<00:03:56.760> how

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
clean up the lines that's basically how

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.159

you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.419> make<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.750> triquetra<00:03:58.139> symbol

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
you can make a triquetra symbol

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.050 
you can make a triquetra symbol
hopefully<00:03:59.129> that's<00:03:59.250> been<00:03:59.280> helpful<00:03:59.370> if<00:03:59.939> you
