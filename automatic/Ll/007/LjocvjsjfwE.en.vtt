little quick tutorial on the swamp man
and<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.269> genesis<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> swamp<00:00:10.740> man<00:00:11.179> first

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and the genesis of the swamp man first

and the genesis of the swamp man first
thing<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.719> need<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.710> get<00:00:14.130> some<00:00:14.340> trees

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
thing I need to do was get some trees

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.080 
thing I need to do was get some trees
for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.750> sloth<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.070> used<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.820> program

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
for the sloth and I used a program

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
for the sloth and I used a program
called<00:00:18.630> view<00:00:19.170> vuv<00:00:20.119> from<00:00:21.119> p<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.510> software<00:00:22.170> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
called view vuv from p on software it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.070 
called view vuv from p on software it's
a<00:00:22.859> super<00:00:23.550> high-end<00:00:23.970> piece<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> software<00:00:24.840> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
a super high-end piece of software but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
a super high-end piece of software but
it<00:00:25.199> takes<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.769> years<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.550> render<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> frame<00:00:27.240> so

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it takes like years to render a frame so

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.290 
it takes like years to render a frame so
i<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.519> using<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> tools

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
i would just using some of the tools

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.749 
i would just using some of the tools
that<00:00:30.720> program<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> render<00:00:31.980> trees<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that program has to render trees and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.610 
that program has to render trees and
model<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.450> trees<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:34.020> guess<00:00:34.230> some<00:00:34.350> trees

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
model some trees so i guess some trees

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.670 
model some trees so i guess some trees
from<00:00:35.520> view<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.899> converted<00:00:36.899> them<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> objects

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
from view and converted them to objects

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.100 
from view and converted them to objects
and<00:00:37.800> brought<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.309> iclone<00:00:38.850> found<00:00:39.840> some

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and brought them into iclone found some

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.540 
and brought them into iclone found some

and<00:00:57.719> give<00:00:58.170> him<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> texture<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> next<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and give him a texture the next thing I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.049 
and give him a texture the next thing I
needed<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:01.020> Spanish<00:01:01.469> moss<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> got

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
needed was some Spanish moss so I got

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.740 
needed was some Spanish moss so I got
the<00:01:03.680> Flex<00:01:04.680> cloth<00:01:05.010> material<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.030> went<00:01:06.630> online

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the Flex cloth material and went online

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
the Flex cloth material and went online
once<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.470> found<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.340> picture<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.150> Spanish

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
once again found a picture of Spanish

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
once again found a picture of Spanish
moss<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.549> textured<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:13.530> object<00:01:14.070> with

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
moss and so I textured that object with

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.420 
moss and so I textured that object with
the<00:01:14.729> Spanish<00:01:15.210> moss<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.810> created<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.710> opacity

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the Spanish moss and created an opacity

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
the Spanish moss and created an opacity
map<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.979> Photoshop<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> gave<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
map in Photoshop and can I gave it to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
map in Photoshop and can I gave it to
see<00:01:22.979> through<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.729> maybe<00:01:24.150> Spanish<00:01:24.570> moss

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
see through look like maybe Spanish moss

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.920 
see through look like maybe Spanish moss
should<00:01:25.530> look<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:27.060> helped<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
should look and that helped a lot and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.999 
should look and that helped a lot and
then<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.470> able<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.570> take<00:01:30.570> those<00:01:31.049> textures

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
then I was able to take those textures

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
then I was able to take those textures
and<00:01:32.720> put<00:01:33.720> them<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> tree<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and put them on the tree and so now the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
and put them on the tree and so now the
tree<00:01:36.979> has<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.810> Spanish<00:01:40.020> moss<00:01:40.290> hanging<00:01:40.590> from

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
tree has the Spanish moss hanging from

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
tree has the Spanish moss hanging from
it<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.520> gave<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.210> Spanish<00:01:42.750> moss

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it and that gave me the Spanish moss

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.170 
it and that gave me the Spanish moss
effect<00:01:43.460> which<00:01:44.460> worked<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.119> okay<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
effect which worked out I think okay and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.710 
effect which worked out I think okay and
then<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:48.869> thing<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.890> took<00:01:50.570> great<00:01:51.570> my

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
then the next thing I took great my

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
then the next thing I took great my
swamp<00:01:51.990> man<00:01:52.200> took<00:01:53.130> Dylan<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.170> gave<00:01:55.170> him<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.649> see

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
swamp man took Dylan and gave him a see

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.359 
swamp man took Dylan and gave him a see
one<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> female<00:01:57.360> hairstyles<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:59.719> took<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
one of the female hairstyles I took the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.700 
one of the female hairstyles I took the
Spanish<00:02:02.369> moss<00:02:02.549> texture<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> textured<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
Spanish moss texture and textured the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.080 
Spanish moss texture and textured the
hairstyle<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> spin-off<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
hairstyle with the spin-off and so it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.750 
hairstyle with the spin-off and so it
gave<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> nice<00:02:09.720> effect<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.430> used<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
gave a nice effect and I used that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.059 
gave a nice effect and I used that
Spanish<00:02:12.209> moss<00:02:12.390> texture<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.470> upper<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
Spanish moss texture on the upper and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.360 
Spanish moss texture on the upper and
lower<00:02:14.340> clone<00:02:14.910> cloth<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.680> created<00:02:17.040> another

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
lower clone cloth and I created another

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780 
lower clone cloth and I created another
tree<00:02:17.700> bark<00:02:17.970> texture<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.319> skin<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
tree bark texture for the skin so it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.520 
tree bark texture for the skin so it
started<00:02:21.300> getting<00:02:21.390> skin<00:02:21.810> or<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> locked

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
started getting skin or like a locked

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.690 
started getting skin or like a locked
and<00:02:22.739> then<00:02:23.250> took<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.489> trees<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.129> kind<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.250> move

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and then took my trees and kind of move

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.199 
and then took my trees and kind of move
my<00:02:26.970> trees<00:02:27.239> around<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.020> attach<00:02:28.680> them<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:30.000> della

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
my trees around and attach them to della

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.589 
my trees around and attach them to della
and<00:02:30.980> gave<00:02:31.980> him<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.489> tree<00:02:32.700> bark<00:02:32.940> effect<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
and gave him the tree bark effect and
