so I mean that got scrapped and it took
a<00:01:01.640> long<00:01:01.820> time<00:01:01.879> for<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.329> reissue<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:02.840> out

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
a long time for the reissue to get out

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.960 
a long time for the reissue to get out
and<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.469> was<00:01:03.590> just<00:01:03.829> all<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.160> it<00:01:04.699> was<00:01:04.820> like<00:01:04.940> a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
and it was just all the it was like a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.510 
and it was just all the it was like a
few<00:01:05.149> new<00:01:05.239> songs<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.929> remixes<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.280> stuff<00:01:07.490> I

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
few new songs and remixes and stuff I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.889 
few new songs and remixes and stuff I
think<00:01:07.670> there's<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.880> kusik<00:01:08.179> song<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.539> there<00:01:08.690> too

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
think there's a kusik song in there too

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.230 
think there's a kusik song in there too
so<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.039> kind<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.280> felt<00:01:10.460> like<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.850> guess

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so that that kind of felt like I guess

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.669 
so that that kind of felt like I guess
like<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> disappointment<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.020> fans<00:01:12.200> too<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.649> a

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
like a disappointment of fans too and a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.370 
like a disappointment of fans too and a
big<00:01:12.830> controversy<00:01:13.190> around<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.750> yeah<00:01:15.170> that

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
big controversy around that so yeah that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.529 
big controversy around that so yeah that
was<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.530> bit<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.360> controversy<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.450> drama

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
was a bit of the controversy and drama

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.270 
was a bit of the controversy and drama
surrounding<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.229> band<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.590> lot<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.890> fans<00:01:19.100> were

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
surrounding the band a lot of fans were

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.710 
surrounding the band a lot of fans were
probably<00:01:19.490> skeptical<00:01:19.970> about<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.539> big<00:01:20.690> changes

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
probably skeptical about the big changes

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.660 
probably skeptical about the big changes
in<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.229> band<00:01:21.380> meaning<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.920> could<00:01:22.039> be<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.190> huge

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
in the band meaning it could be a huge

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.969 
in the band meaning it could be a huge
sound<00:01:23.119> difference<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.810> album<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.860> know

sound difference in the album you know
like<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.310> said<00:01:25.369> especially<00:01:25.940> with<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.090> new

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210

screamer

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
screamer

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.570 
screamer
and<00:01:26.840> clean<00:01:27.170> vocalist<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.130> getting<00:01:28.369> away<00:01:28.520> from

and clean vocalist so getting away from
the<00:01:28.789> controversy<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.450> drama<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:29.780> actually

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
the controversy and drama and actually

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840 
the controversy and drama and actually
getting<00:01:30.259> into<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.560> album<00:01:30.860> review<00:01:31.100> itself<00:01:31.550> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
getting into the album review itself I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.910 
getting into the album review itself I
feel<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.930> intro<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:33.500> album<00:01:33.860> is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
feel like the intro to this album is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.100 
feel like the intro to this album is
actually<00:01:34.040> kind<00:01:34.549> of<00:01:34.670> weak<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:35.299> was<00:01:35.869> very

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
actually kind of weak I was very

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.050 
actually kind of weak I was very
disappointed<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.369> song<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.759> day<00:01:37.909> it

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
disappointed with the song do you day it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.569 
disappointed with the song do you day it
was<00:01:38.149> literally<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.840> think<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.710> 36<00:01:40.189> seconds<00:01:40.460> of

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
was literally I think with 36 seconds of

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.510 
was literally I think with 36 seconds of
this<00:01:41.140> just<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.259> filler<00:01:42.530> track<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.040> mean<00:01:43.189> for<00:01:43.430> me

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
this just a filler track I mean for me

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.770 
this just a filler track I mean for me
it<00:01:43.729> was<00:01:43.850> kind<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:44.240> like<00:01:44.360> an<00:01:44.479> intro<00:01:44.750> into

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it was kind of just like an intro into

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.330 
it was kind of just like an intro into
the<00:01:45.229> first<00:01:45.439> song<00:01:45.619> which<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:45.890> think<00:01:46.070> could<00:01:46.250> have

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
the first song which I think could have

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.730 
the first song which I think could have
just<00:01:46.490> put<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.670> two<00:01:46.880> songs<00:01:47.090> together<00:01:47.680> it's<00:01:48.680> not

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
just put the two songs together it's not

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.050 
just put the two songs together it's not
the<00:01:48.920> fact<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.219> it<00:01:49.310> was<00:01:49.430> really<00:01:49.520> bad<00:01:49.759> it's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
the fact that it was really bad it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.370 
the fact that it was really bad it's
just<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.420> felt<00:01:50.659> like<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.869> was<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.200> filler

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
just I felt like it was just a filler

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.020 
just I felt like it was just a filler
and<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.920> know<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.250> probably<00:01:52.670> could<00:01:52.909> have<00:01:52.939> been

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and you know it probably could have been

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.310 
and you know it probably could have been
couldn't<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.689> been<00:01:53.840> there<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.170> would

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
couldn't have been there and I would

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.830 
couldn't have been there and I would
have<00:01:54.409> been<00:01:54.469> pleased<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.909> second<00:01:56.270> song<00:01:56.420> FYI

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
have been pleased the second song FYI

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.600 
have been pleased the second song FYI
which<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.350> felt<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.890> what<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.219> was<00:01:58.310> leading

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
which I felt like is what it was leading

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.450 
which I felt like is what it was leading
into<00:01:59.170> it<00:02:00.170> was<00:02:00.289> an<00:02:00.380> okay<00:02:00.649> song<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.130> mean<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.340> was

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
into it was an okay song I mean it was

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.459 
into it was an okay song I mean it was
fully<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:01.939> screaming<00:02:02.299> from<00:02:02.479> doriano<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
fully just screaming from doriano so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.170 
fully just screaming from doriano so
it's<00:02:03.619> pretty<00:02:03.770> heavy<00:02:04.009> but<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.789> know<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.060> usual

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
it's pretty heavy but you know the usual

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.760 
it's pretty heavy but you know the usual
breakdown<00:02:05.780> thing<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.259> think<00:02:06.320> people<00:02:06.680> are

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
breakdown thing that I think people are

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.009 
breakdown thing that I think people are
expecting<00:02:06.890> from<00:02:07.219> this<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.000> overall<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.570> felt<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
expecting from this so overall I felt a

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.210 
expecting from this so overall I felt a
little<00:02:09.140> disappointed<00:02:09.769> with<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:09.920> intro<00:02:10.190> to

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
little disappointed with the intro to

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.800 
little disappointed with the intro to
the<00:02:10.399> album<00:02:10.700> by<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.880> time<00:02:11.060> we'd<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.299> track<00:02:11.510> 3

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the album by the time we'd the track 3

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.720 
the album by the time we'd the track 3
however<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.470> feel<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.160> album<00:02:13.400> picks<00:02:13.579> off

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
however I feel like the album picks off

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.210 
however I feel like the album picks off
with<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> story<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.269> tell<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.680> finally<00:02:15.950> see

were<00:03:39.439> periphery<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.599> volumes<00:03:41.599> saying<00:03:42.049> that

were periphery and volumes saying that

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.360 
were periphery and volumes saying that
ripped<00:03:42.319> out<00:03:42.469> the<00:03:42.590> intro<00:03:42.859> of<00:03:42.889> some<00:03:43.159> of<00:03:43.250> their

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370

ripped out the intro of some of their
songs<00:03:43.780> or<00:03:44.780> started<00:03:45.169> like<00:03:45.260> one<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.500> their<00:03:45.680> songs

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
songs or started like one of their songs

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.099 
songs or started like one of their songs
the<00:03:46.310> other<00:03:46.430> bands<00:03:46.669> but<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.329> kind<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.870> ignore

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
the other bands but I kind of ignore

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.629 
the other bands but I kind of ignore
that<00:03:48.290> because<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.739> know<00:03:48.829> stuff<00:03:49.250> happens

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
that because you know stuff happens

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.699 
that because you know stuff happens
where<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.790> have<00:03:50.139> contrasting<00:03:51.139> instrumentals

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
where you have contrasting instrumentals

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.780 
where you have contrasting instrumentals
you<00:03:51.769> know<00:03:51.889> it<00:03:51.979> may<00:03:52.129> sound<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.459> something

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
you know it may sound like something

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.670 
you know it may sound like something
else<00:03:52.909> it<00:03:53.479> happens<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.930> lot<00:03:53.959> more<00:03:54.260> often<00:03:54.560> than

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
else it happens a lot more often than

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.390 
else it happens a lot more often than
you<00:03:54.769> think<00:03:54.829> so

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
you think so

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.729

a<00:03:59.269> interesting<00:04:00.109> intro<00:04:00.409> but<00:04:00.680> overall<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.370> was

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
a interesting intro but overall it was

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
members of the band so they couldn't

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.590

and I will say it's okay I mean I feel
like<00:05:12.420> it<00:05:12.480> was<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.660> good<00:05:12.780> effort<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.830> band

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
like it was a good effort and the band

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.070 
like it was a good effort and the band
is<00:05:14.160> doing<00:05:14.250> what<00:05:14.580> they<00:05:14.670> enjoy<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.990> know
