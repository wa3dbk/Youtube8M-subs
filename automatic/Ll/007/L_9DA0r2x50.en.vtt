00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
understand to be honest so i just wanted

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.140 
understand to be honest so i just wanted
to<00:03:39.260> show<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.070> literally<00:03:40.489> don't<00:03:41.000> have

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
to show that like I literally don't have

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.600 
to show that like I literally don't have
um<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:43.810> don't<00:03:44.810> have<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.980> client<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.130> made<00:03:46.340> me<00:03:46.459> do

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
um I don't have a client that made me do

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.949 
um I don't have a client that made me do
this<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.910> pretty<00:03:47.150> much<00:03:47.239> just<00:03:47.360> did<00:03:47.780> what

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
this I pretty much just did what

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.539 
this I pretty much just did what
everybody<00:03:48.200> else<00:03:48.410> has<00:03:48.620> access<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.310> so

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
everybody else has access to so

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.300 
everybody else has access to so
therefore<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.450> doesn't<00:03:51.169> give<00:03:52.130> me<00:03:52.220> an

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
therefore it doesn't give me an

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.360 
therefore it doesn't give me an
advantage<00:03:52.639> over<00:03:52.910> anybody<00:03:53.359> else

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
advantage over anybody else

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.750 
advantage over anybody else

for it on cosmic and if it really I'm
probably<00:04:40.640> not<00:04:40.850> going<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.060> get<00:04:41.180> unbanned<00:04:41.510> for

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
probably not going to get unbanned for

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.220 
probably not going to get unbanned for
those<00:04:41.930> who<00:04:42.350> care<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:42.920> I'm<00:04:43.730> probably<00:04:44.000> going<00:04:44.810> to

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
those who care so I'm probably going to

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.680 
those who care so I'm probably going to
have<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.410> either<00:04:45.820> quit<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:47.030> don't<00:04:47.270> know<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.600> don't

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
have to either quit I don't know I don't

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.890 
have to either quit I don't know I don't
really<00:04:47.900> want<00:04:48.230> to<00:04:48.350> waste<00:04:48.890> money<00:04:49.190> on<00:04:49.310> another

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
really want to waste money on another

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.960 
really want to waste money on another
like<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.050> literally<00:04:51.410> can't<00:04:52.190> play<00:04:52.370> any<00:04:52.550> planet

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
like I literally can't play any planet

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.520 
like I literally can't play any planet
so<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.480> have<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.970> four<00:04:56.240> or<00:04:56.360> five<00:04:56.390> ranks<00:04:56.930> on<00:04:57.080> on

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
so I have like four or five ranks on on

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.680 
so I have like four or five ranks on on
cosmic<00:04:58.070> altogether<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:59.120> have<00:04:59.300> noble

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
cosmic altogether and I have noble

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.840 
cosmic altogether and I have noble
almost<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.020> highest<00:05:00.170> one<00:05:00.440> on<00:05:00.590> forgotten<00:05:01.340> so

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
almost the highest one on forgotten so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.130 
almost the highest one on forgotten so
that's<00:05:02.000> kind<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.360> bummer<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.690> that's

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140
