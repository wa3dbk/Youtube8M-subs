of working with science and football

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
of working with science and football
together<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.550> relatively<00:00:27.300> recent

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

occurrence in England assume the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
occurrence in England assume the
countries<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.140> work<00:00:31.380> too<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.949> been<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.369> on

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
countries of work too it's been going on

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.959 
countries of work too it's been going on
for<00:00:32.759> many<00:00:32.880> many<00:00:33.090> years<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.880> it<00:00:35.880> will

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
for many many years I think that it will

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
for many many years I think that it will
give<00:00:36.120> us<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.270> great<00:00:36.450> advantage<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.989> try<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
give us a great advantage to try and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 
give us a great advantage to try and
catch<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.030> Laurel

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
catch up and then like we do in Laurel

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
catch up and then like we do in Laurel
of<00:00:39.600> things<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.290> start<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.980> lead<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.180> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of things then we start to lead so I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.650 
of things then we start to lead so I
think<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.020> fantastic<00:00:43.200> initiative<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
think it's a fantastic initiative I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
think it's a fantastic initiative I
think<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.809> still<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.200> early<00:00:46.350> days<00:00:46.710> i

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
think it's still very early days i

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
think it's still very early days i

for the model for the last 10 15 years

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.440 
for the model for the last 10 15 years
and<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.630> Germans<00:01:11.049> are<00:01:11.430> streets<00:01:12.430> ahead<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.909> a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and the Germans are streets ahead of a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.760 
and the Germans are streets ahead of a
lot<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.659> countries<00:01:14.080> most<00:01:14.290> countries<00:01:14.590> not<00:01:14.710> just

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
lot of countries most countries not just

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.850 
lot of countries most countries not just
England<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:17.170> started<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.619> project

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
England and so we started a project

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.510 
England and so we started a project
called<00:01:18.520> Project<00:01:19.530> 208<00:01:20.530> just<00:01:21.190> before<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
called Project 208 just before the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.539 
called Project 208 just before the
European<00:01:21.820> Championships<00:01:22.390> where<00:01:23.310> every<00:01:24.310> club

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
European Championships where every club

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.350 
European Championships where every club
is<00:01:24.670> affiliated<00:01:25.149> with<00:01:26.940> they<00:01:27.940> have<00:01:28.060> sports

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
is affiliated with they have sports

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.810 
is affiliated with they have sports
scientists<00:01:29.080> who<00:01:29.680> are<00:01:29.860> trying<00:01:30.130> through<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
scientists who are trying through the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.910 
scientists who are trying through the
university's<00:01:31.360> it's<00:01:31.509> ellsberg<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.200> elsewhere

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
university's it's ellsberg and elsewhere

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.200 
university's it's ellsberg and elsewhere
and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.250> through<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.490> Football

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
and then through the Football

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.149 
and then through the Football
Association<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:35.140> two<00:01:35.679> things<00:01:35.830> are<00:01:36.039> linked

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
Association so two things are linked

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
Association so two things are linked
very<00:01:36.340> closely<00:01:36.580> together<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:38.580> each<00:01:39.580> player

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
very closely together and each player

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.830 
very closely together and each player
especially<00:01:41.259> national<00:01:41.860> players<00:01:42.069> are<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:43.479> or

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
especially national players are or or

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.600 
especially national players are or or

tests in sports scientists not once or

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.109 
tests in sports scientists not once or
twice<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.600> year<00:01:52.720> which<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:53.049> quite<00:01:53.649> commonplace

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
twice a year which is quite commonplace

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.930 
twice a year which is quite commonplace
maybe<00:01:55.119> twenty<00:01:55.539> times<00:01:55.780> here<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:57.039> also<00:01:57.580> we

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
maybe twenty times here and also we

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.710 
maybe twenty times here and also we
introduce<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.869> Prost<00:01:59.280> process<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:01.600> we

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
introduce a Prost process of what we

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.180 
introduce a Prost process of what we
call<00:02:01.840> performance<00:02:02.409> testing<00:02:02.679> not<00:02:02.860> fitness

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
call performance testing not fitness

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.669 
call performance testing not fitness
testing<00:02:03.549> which<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.450> talk<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.289> all<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> coaches

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
testing which is talk to all the coaches

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.440 
testing which is talk to all the coaches
and<00:02:06.099> then<00:02:06.789> they<00:02:06.940> go<00:02:07.119> back<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.330> their

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
and then they go back to their

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.859 
and then they go back to their
collection<00:02:07.660> they<00:02:08.020> do<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.349> once<00:02:08.590> every<00:02:09.160> week

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
collection they do that once every week

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.449 
collection they do that once every week
so<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.379> type<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.860> development

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
so you can see that type of development

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.240 
so you can see that type of development
is<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.360> long<00:02:13.629> way<00:02:13.950> ahead<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.190> what<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.550> do

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
is a long way ahead of what we do

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.340 
is a long way ahead of what we do
I<00:02:17.330> was<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> first<00:02:18.450> full-time<00:02:18.990> fitness

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
I was the first full-time fitness

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.850 
I was the first full-time fitness
coaching<00:02:19.680> British<00:02:19.950> football<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.370> 1981<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.860> at

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
coaching British football in 1981 and at

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
coaching British football in 1981 and at
the<00:02:22.980> time<00:02:23.160> I'd<00:02:23.490> come<00:02:23.700> back<00:02:23.820> from<00:02:24.030> working

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the time I'd come back from working

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.570 
the time I'd come back from working
three<00:02:24.720> years<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.050> brazil<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.620> using<00:02:26.220> portable

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
three years in brazil and using portable

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.640 
three years in brazil and using portable
and<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.810> came<00:02:27.990> back<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.230> England<00:02:28.350> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and when I came back to England and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.310 
and when I came back to England and
realized<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.660> things<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.200> were

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
realized that the things that we were

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.650 
realized that the things that we were
trying<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.650> advocate<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.970> were<00:02:33.060> being<00:02:33.390> laughed

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
trying to advocate we were being laughed

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.190 
trying to advocate we were being laughed
at<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.180> football<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:37.050> not

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
at you know this is football it's not

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
at you know this is football it's not
science<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.070> football<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:38.700> art

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
science this is football it's not art

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
science this is football it's not art
because<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.440> little<00:02:40.680> bit<00:02:40.830> different

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
because that's a little bit different

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.310 
because that's a little bit different
you<00:02:41.490> know<00:02:41.610> especially<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.060> Brazil<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.600> they

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you know especially in Brazil they they

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.880 
you know especially in Brazil they they
merge<00:02:43.740> art<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.760> science<00:02:45.510> together<00:02:45.890> because

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
merge art and science together because

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.410 
merge art and science together because
the<00:02:47.010> question<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.700> football<00:02:48.060> art<00:02:48.270> or

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the question is is football art or

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.360 
the question is is football art or
science<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.740> answer<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
science and the answer that the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
science and the answer that the
Brazilian<00:02:50.820> coast<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.240> go<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.750> science<00:02:52.080> it's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
Brazilian coast we go it's science it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.800 
Brazilian coast we go it's science it's
a<00:02:52.650> sorry<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.100> art<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.910> backed<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.360> by

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
a sorry it's art which is backed up by

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.060 
a sorry it's art which is backed up by
science<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.090> we've<00:02:57.720> tended<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.410> past<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
science and we've tended in the past to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.130 
science and we've tended in the past to
separate<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.610> two<00:02:59.820> footballs<00:03:00.510> either<00:03:00.720> an

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
separate the two footballs either an

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530 
separate the two footballs either an
entertainment<00:03:01.920> which<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.190> played<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:03.240> it's<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
entertainment which is played or it's a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.990 
entertainment which is played or it's a
scientific<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.560> know<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.800> two<00:03:05.010> things<00:03:05.310> start

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
scientific you know the two things start

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.900 
scientific you know the two things start
and<00:03:06.210> slowly<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.840> come<00:03:06.990> together<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> they<00:03:08.700> are

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
and slowly to come together but they are

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
and slowly to come together but they are
still<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.450> wire<00:03:09.750> parting<00:03:10.260> involve<00:03:10.680> people's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
still a wire parting involve people's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
still a wire parting involve people's
minds
