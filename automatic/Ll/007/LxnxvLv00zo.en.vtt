00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.889
 good morning evenings nights in my case 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.610
 days or evenings what you prefer they are 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.810
 the twenty-fifth of Saturday, the 8th 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.670
 December 2012 and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 today I come with a new tutorial in the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.939
 I'm going to show you this fantastic 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 program that I had to if you know how to use 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.130
 it's going to be worth everything and it's going to be super 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 practical what is this good program 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.780
 this program what will allow us 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.800
 is to be able to play games 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.360
 and be able to change numbers in a game 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.690
 change numbers for example the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.910
 money if we have 12 euros or whatever 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.910
 to be able to put 2000 for example 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.440
 it does not help us not only for games 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.399
 but for all the applications we can 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.399
 change several things 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 so I'm going to see an example 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.360
 clear on the dead island 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.100
 and let's see how it works 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.420
 first let's give it here for 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.909
 select the program and I'm going to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.880
 select yesterday and I'm going to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.940
 give open 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.940
 now we are going to the big square 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 Inventory 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 for this but I'm going to this number I'm going 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 to put 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.650
 let's look 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 let's put the number 78 70 and we're going 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:07.560
 to give first that first scan 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.259
 I was going to find 43 found 43 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 tickets and how do we know what the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.730
 our 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 well let's go again to the day 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.020
 dyland and I explain 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 the look tells us that we have 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.680
 Y 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 ok let's put your number 169 05 and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.909
 we are going to give it to next 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.549
 and now it's just going to give us a value 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.830
 let's double- click on it and we're going to 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.410
 have here 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.600
 we double- click on the value and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.110
 we can change to our whim the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.450
 number is going to go up 1000 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.370
 and it has already been changed on the day of the voucher 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 not only money can you change all the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.100
 experience the ammunition can eat 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.180
 everything that has numbers this problem 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.260
 what it is based on is looking for its number and 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.310
 Then you look for how it has changed without 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.930
 number the first we searched 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.160
 the first number again so 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.420
 was and after we searched 77 1905 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.720
 which means that all 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.930
 previous ones are not worth they are only worth only 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.269
 the one that has changed 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.930
 the one that has changed we have here and the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.900
 that have not changed because they have forgotten 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.819
 I do not know if I explain myself more or less 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.909
 we enter a value it changes the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.239
 center of the game you put the new value and 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.870
 today there will only be one mother and that is the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.870
 what do you have to change 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.930
 let's see how they change the dead island 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.319
 as you see 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.319
 it has already been changed and I do not know 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.420
 with a little more money so that 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.420
 change of update 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.630
 version had 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.199
 values things 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.160
 you are welcome 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.160
 of destiny 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.139
 / you are not you
