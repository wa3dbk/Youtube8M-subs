00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.759
 We are in the research laboratory of the chair of 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.770
 cellular and molecular biology this faculty of biochemistry and science 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 of the Holy Inés University 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.759
 city ​​of santa fe 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.859
 to work several research groups 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 one of which is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359
 all research groups work in chile 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.159
 study of plant genes 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.309
 aspects of functionality or how the genes of the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.210
 in this place you are 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.220
 while the October study plant our group are the plants of 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.950
 sunflower 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.600
 the donors 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290
 that's why we repudiate as well 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.580
 the plants 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.410
 receptors of these genes 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.210
 or model plant 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 are those of arabidopsis thaliana 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.700
 sunflower was chosen by 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 agronomic interest vine 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 the cultivation in the country 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.230
 and where there were not too many of your group 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.720
 they were investigating 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 what we do is take what different genes are needed 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.760
 put them in some way used transgenically with a methodology 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.160
 special to the whole arabidopsis plant that has been chosen as 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.620
 model child 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.720
 I can not see them the plants of those plants transformed france 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.310
 they say it is not their own 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.140
 look how they behave and can elucidate a bit how people work 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 is making that gene 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 in the original plant from which it came out 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.940
 despite its end or typical 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 not only do they consist 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.400
 in comparing the power plant and the transgenic plants by effect of the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.270
 salt vázquez 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.330
 if not also that put them different environmental conditions 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.980
 a normal plant 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.880
 non-transgenic 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.180
 detects a lack of water triggers had a cascade which there are hormones act 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350
 of surrender finally many reflectors many proteins 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.390
 that among all of them 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 manassero that the plant tried to avoid the damage that caused it by 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.449
 lack of water 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.459
 our order is acting 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.719
 to another level 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.129
 protecting the plant 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.239
 the oxidative damage that occurs in conditions 3 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.100
 there was damage 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.629
 by shenzhen you want moon 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.419
 the same aging of the plant in this plant 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.539
 it would be slowing down this aging 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.909
 allowing the plant 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 stay together longer and when you get water again 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.249
 the band has different pruning mechanisms 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.659
 defend against ethnic groups 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.649
 and is directed by this axis 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.329
 the sepyme southern gene that contains tolerance to drought 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.669
 is more tolerant 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.049
 to the drought 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.819
 very interesting especially in the 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.829
 Rubiales are insufficient 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.489
 let's say the cases directly 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:04.870
 intego
