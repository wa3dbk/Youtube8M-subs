00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.980
 the genetic wine medicine is a 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.920
 discipline a therapeutic technique in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.770
 reality that we apply in bio health as 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.110
 pioneers throughout europe consists of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 do a preliminary study of the load 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.539
 genetics that has produced the one that has 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.900
 activated to develop a disease 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.119
 determined for example let's think about a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 rheumatic disease a patient with a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.830
 rheumatic disease has a burden 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.430
 genetics that has been activated and that has 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.730
 made that disease develop 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.370
 articulate and no other 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.040
 so many times the patient then 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.629
 may have a viral infection 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.059
 cytomegalovirus by the virus of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.870
 steinberg for the herpes simplex virus 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.989
 is any more heavy metals in order 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.910
 a whole series of external factors that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.309
 they activate that genetic load 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.410
 that one has and this is what makes 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.780
 the same causes and that's a mistake that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.180
 It is lavishing in medicine that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 when there is a certain pathology to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.560
 all patients are treated for the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.960
 same way and that's a mistake because if 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.610
 there are not two identical people in the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 world because the treatments have to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.850
 be identical 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.350
 then sent greetings we do 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 we do treatments 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.659
 individualized and customized 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.990
 we do in this case then effectively 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.470
 the one in the same cause in a person 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.979
 produce rheumatoid arthritis in another 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.740
 person 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.560
 that same thing produces a syndrome of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 crohn or ulcerative colitis or a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 ankylosing spondylitis or any 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.570
 another disease especially talking about 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 what today is called diseases 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.330
 autoimmune because all these cases the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.970
 difference is that genetic load that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.310
 has the person then we are born with 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 a predisposition to certain 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.899
 diseases and us what we do 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.220
 is to detect when it has been activated 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.960
 is developing a disease 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.330
 determined what is the genetic load 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.300
 You are having that person once you 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.130
 we have detected we apply the techniques 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.760
 within what medicine is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.350
 biological to disable 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.420
 specifically that genetic load but 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.239
 when when we have previously 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.870
 eliminated all those external factors 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.580
 that we have listed before 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.220
 have activated that genetic load 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.750
 heavy metals especially poisoning 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 chronic mercury that comes 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.549
 fundamentally of the amalgams or 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.860
 is chronic viral infections or 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.500
 candidiasis, especially candida if it is 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.959
 intestinal are all pathologies that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.030
 together situations that together activate 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.700
 those genetic charges and where yes 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.650
 we really want to heal and that is that is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.870
 my illusion as a doctor evidently 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.840
 Well, what we have to do is look 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.950
 those external factors look for that burden 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.319
 genetics is the one that has been activated 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.280
 eliminate those external factors that are 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.840
 different in each person and finally 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.239
 turn off that genetic load so 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 that way that person reaches his state 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.230
 natural as before it had 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.420
 activated that process and that way 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.890
 we can cure many diseases that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.370
 they have to do with predisposition 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.370
 genetics 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.260
