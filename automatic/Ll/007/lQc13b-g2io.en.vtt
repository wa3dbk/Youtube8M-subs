water and when we look at those things
we're<00:00:38.460> looking<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.530> mass<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.980> just

we're looking at not just mass not just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
we're looking at not just mass not just
matter<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.090> looking<00:00:42.240> at<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> transfer

matter but we're looking at the transfer
of<00:00:43.200> energy<00:00:43.380> we're<00:00:44.100> looking<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of energy we're looking at how that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.240 
of energy we're looking at how that
moves<00:00:45.720> from<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.290> place<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.560> another<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.130> how

moves from one place to another and how

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.120 
moves from one place to another and how

its transformed in its movement we also

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.500 
its transformed in its movement we also
are<00:00:50.490> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.820> looking<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.240> the<00:00:51.390> most

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
are going to be looking at the most

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
are going to be looking at the most
tranquil<00:00:51.870> things<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.680> looking<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.400> light<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
tranquil things of looking at light on

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
tranquil things of looking at light on
water<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.630> we<00:00:54.720> might<00:00:54.930> walk<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.560> pond<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
water when we might walk by a pond and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.550 
water when we might walk by a pond and
what<00:00:56.880> are<00:00:57.030> challenging<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.050> course<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
what are challenging in this course is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.890 
what are challenging in this course is
to<00:00:58.739> connect<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.280> images<00:00:59.760> together<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.720> ask

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
to connect these images together to ask

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.950 
to connect these images together to ask
why<00:01:01.410> sometimes<00:01:02.150> energetic<00:01:03.150> phenomena<00:01:03.720> are

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
why sometimes energetic phenomena are

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.739 
why sometimes energetic phenomena are
dispersed<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.069> widely<00:01:05.729> separated<00:01:05.999> why<00:01:06.689> are

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
dispersed and widely separated why are

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.899 
dispersed and widely separated why are
they<00:01:06.929> sometimes<00:01:07.200> concentrate<00:01:08.189> together<00:01:08.549> into

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
they sometimes concentrate together into

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.660 
they sometimes concentrate together into
amazing<00:01:09.749> things<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.229> waterfalls<00:01:10.679> or<00:01:11.280> like

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
amazing things like waterfalls or like

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
amazing things like waterfalls or like
waves<00:01:11.999> on<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> beach<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.740> thunderstorm

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
waves on a beach or like a thunderstorm

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.669 
waves on a beach or like a thunderstorm
and<00:01:14.999> what<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.359> fundamentally<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
and what we're fundamentally gonna do is

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.370 
and what we're fundamentally gonna do is
to<00:01:16.859> try<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.069> use<00:01:17.670> energy<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.719> theme<00:01:19.049> or

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to try to use energy as the theme or

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.739 
to try to use energy as the theme or
thee<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:20.310> Metis<00:01:20.759> story<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> story<00:01:21.569> that

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
thee is the Metis story the story that

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.020 
thee is the Metis story the story that
underlies<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.740> other<00:01:22.889> stories<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> how

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
underlies all the other stories of how

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.389 
underlies all the other stories of how
these<00:01:24.270> transformations<00:01:25.170> take<00:01:25.439> place<00:01:25.710> we're

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
these transformations take place we're

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.580 
these transformations take place we're
gonna<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.639> looking<00:01:26.969> at<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.509> basic<00:01:27.749> questions

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gonna be looking at some basic questions

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.739 
gonna be looking at some basic questions
the<00:01:28.829> questions<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> humans<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> Allison's

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
the questions that humans of Allison's

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:33.859 
the questions that humans of Allison's
time<00:01:31.499> and<00:01:31.770> memorial<00:01:31.880> questions<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.209> why<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
time and memorial questions like why is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
time and memorial questions like why is
the<00:01:34.139> sky<00:01:34.409> blue<00:01:34.939> where<00:01:35.939> does<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.209> wind<00:01:36.359> come

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the sky blue where does the wind come

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.779 
the sky blue where does the wind come
from<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> where<00:01:37.200> does<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.439> wind<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.709> to<00:01:37.859> but

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
from and where does the wind go to but

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.859 
from and where does the wind go to but
we're<00:01:38.909> also<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.389> ask<00:01:39.539> some<00:01:39.840> very

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
we're also going to ask some very

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
we're also going to ask some very
interesting<00:01:40.619> questions<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.189> why<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.609> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
interesting questions like why is the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.719 
interesting questions like why is the
earth<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.359> warm<00:01:42.959> as<00:01:43.139> it<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.709> why<00:01:43.889> does<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
earth as warm as it is and why does it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.789 
earth as warm as it is and why does it
get<00:01:44.969> colder<00:01:45.479> when<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.689> go<00:01:45.810> deeper<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> ocean

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
get colder when we go deeper the ocean

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.069 
get colder when we go deeper the ocean
and<00:01:46.979> perhaps<00:01:47.340> we'll<00:01:48.029> ask<00:01:48.270> why<00:01:48.539> does<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.959> get

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and perhaps we'll ask why does it get

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.779 
and perhaps we'll ask why does it get
colder<00:01:49.529> when<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.709> go<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.859> in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.219> atmosphere

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
colder when we go up in the atmosphere

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.139 
colder when we go up in the atmosphere
we<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.929> hot<00:01:52.740> air<00:01:52.770> rises<00:01:53.459> so<00:01:53.729> why<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.999> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
we know that hot air rises so why is it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
we know that hot air rises so why is it
cold<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.749> go<00:01:54.929> up<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:56.069> we're<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
cold when we go up and we're going to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
cold when we go up and we're going to
try<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.609> connect<00:01:57.029> these<00:01:57.179> things<00:01:57.450> together<00:01:57.749> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
try to connect these things together so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
try to connect these things together so
we<00:01:58.289> understand<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.179> circulation<00:02:00.179> of<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
we understand the circulation of the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.269 
we understand the circulation of the
oceans<00:02:00.779> the<00:02:00.899> circulation<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.770> atmosphere

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:02.279 
oceans the circulation the atmosphere

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.849 
oceans the circulation the atmosphere
and<00:02:02.459> how<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.149> relates<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.929> overall<00:02:04.529> theme

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
and how it relates to this overall theme

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:05.610 
and how it relates to this overall theme
of<00:02:05.099> our
