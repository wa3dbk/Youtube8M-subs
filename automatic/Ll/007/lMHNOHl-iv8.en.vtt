00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
follower making sure we think in a drag
position<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.860> we're<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.039> walking<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
position then we're just walking this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
position then we're just walking this
out<00:00:58.789> okay<00:01:00.859> we'll<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.070> again<00:01:02.309> walking

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
out okay we'll do that again walking

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.299 
out okay we'll do that again walking
backwards<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> fours<00:01:03.769> making<00:01:04.769> sure<00:01:04.949> just

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
backwards the fours making sure just

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
backwards the fours making sure just
assume<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> dragged-out<00:01:06.659> position<00:01:07.350> right

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
assume this dragged-out position right

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.760 
assume this dragged-out position right
here

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
here

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.690
