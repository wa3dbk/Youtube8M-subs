00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.839
 Hello dear viewers 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.839
 here in this, that is all 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 but he lathe trap 10 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.380
 no device 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.060
 for control 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.440
 moving seaside 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.230
 background 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 but like the kiev 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.770
 on other models 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.540
 lathes 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.730
 inexpensive by the end 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.290
 so am 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 and quite comfortable when working 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.120
 well still her favor washington 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.200
 motion control 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 cinema years 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.580
 in operation information 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.810
 what counted the momentum 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.570
 Makhachkala 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.370
 one turn 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.370
 impressions 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.250
 samples control 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.370
 population books 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.590
 Now I decided to do something new. 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.260
 something more interesting 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.030
 Now I will show a simple construction 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480
 which allows 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.820
 comfortable counted 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 evenings moving 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 device that made 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.960
 in making 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.790
 easy to use 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.280
 but you need to do it 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.110
 nato device 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.580
 situation 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.720
 novik whistle responsibility for 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.890
 of fate 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.690
 and fasten 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.490
 such a bracket 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 on it went to the puddle 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.460
 ruler well what a place of honor 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.760
 length 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.090
 maybe even on one bolt fix the st 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.280
 university building 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.449
 we now 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.579
 to set up 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.089
 ours is 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.179
 this system to a certain depth 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.179
 clutch for example need 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.929
 60 millimeters 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.809
 start engine 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.479
 adoption found a typo 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.479
 or relocation we reach number 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.029
 scratch protection 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 it means we have information 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.649
 if needed 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.559
 the other side of brussels instead 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.389
 eg 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.179
 on 30 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.289
 went to drill again 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 reached zero 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.839
 population club 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.009
 so here 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.719
 very comfortably 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.819
 to use 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.139
 practice has shown 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.949
 much more convenient era than something else 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.109
 Muscovites 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.219
 because 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.689
 Well, plum is certainly more accurate 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.699
 but usually greater accuracy at least one 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.709
 but here 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 ruler shows 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.569
 still could 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.239
 depth sergey died in the whole range 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.239
 the course 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.039
 about 12 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.449
 such a device 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.569
 I advise everyone deals no one 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.839
 nothing to measure 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.209
 reason for leaving million
