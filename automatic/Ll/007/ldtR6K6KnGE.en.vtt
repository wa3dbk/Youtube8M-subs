00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
poultry and for this recipe you'll want

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.740 
poultry and for this recipe you'll want
to<00:01:39.810> set<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> pressure<00:01:40.350> regulator<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.400> 3<00:01:41.750> some

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to set the pressure regulator to 3 some

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
to set the pressure regulator to 3 some
foods<00:01:43.020> require<00:01:43.320> moderate<00:01:43.950> amounts<00:01:44.340> of

foods require moderate amounts of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.310 
foods require moderate amounts of
pressure<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.840> set<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> pressure

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
pressure so just set the pressure

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
pressure so just set the pressure
regulator<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.310> 2<00:01:47.549> while<00:01:48.420> cooking<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.899> this
