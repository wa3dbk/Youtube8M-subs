00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
could go ahead and turn that off use

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.520 
could go ahead and turn that off use
power<00:03:26.430> save<00:03:27.290> what<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.410> find<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.830> here<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
power save that will you know just slows

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.560 
power save that will you know just slows
down<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> CPU<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> little<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.209> you'll<00:03:36.360> probably

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
down the CPU a little so you'll probably

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.410 
down the CPU a little so you'll probably
notice<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.110> lag<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:37.530> you're<00:03:37.650> playing<00:03:38.420> some

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
notice the lag if you're playing some

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.840 
notice the lag if you're playing some
games<00:03:39.720> things<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:40.860> rendering<00:03:41.820> a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
games things like that or rendering a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.490 
games things like that or rendering a
couple<00:03:43.940> webpages<00:03:44.959> things<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:48.500> all

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
couple webpages things like that all

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.699 
couple webpages things like that all

other<00:03:49.860> than<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.580> would<00:03:50.850> suggest<00:03:51.030> also<00:03:51.780> if

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
other than that I would suggest also if

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.590 
other than that I would suggest also if
that's<00:03:52.620> still<00:03:52.830> not<00:03:52.950> fixing<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.519> take<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> look

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that's still not fixing it take a look

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.720 
that's still not fixing it take a look
at<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:55.170> wallpaper<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.489> live

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170
