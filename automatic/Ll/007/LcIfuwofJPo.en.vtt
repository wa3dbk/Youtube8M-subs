feel like her mama could have put a
frohawk<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.000> her<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.049> she<00:01:13.080> could<00:01:13.380> have

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
frohawk on her but then she could have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
frohawk on her but then she could have
curls<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.040> she<00:01:14.610> could<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.820> put<00:01:14.970> little

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119

really<00:02:03.210> necessary<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> classroom

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
really necessary for the classroom

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
really necessary for the classroom
environment<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.060> there's

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
environment you know like there's

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
environment you know like there's
nothing<00:02:06.840> wrong<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:07.259> having<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.619> mohawk<00:02:07.950> my

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
nothing wrong with having a mohawk my

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
nothing wrong with having a mohawk my
son<00:02:08.459> wears<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> fro<00:02:08.970> Hawk<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.479> school<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.470> his

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
son wears a fro Hawk to school but his

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.309 
son wears a fro Hawk to school but his
fro<00:02:10.890> Hawk<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.280> tame<00:02:11.550> there's<00:02:11.879> no<00:02:12.000> cut

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
fro Hawk is tame there's no cut

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.020 
fro Hawk is tame there's no cut
he<00:02:12.709> doesn't<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.099> lot<00:02:13.249> of<00:02:13.370> designs<00:02:13.700> in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.179 
he doesn't have a lot of designs in
there<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.140> mean<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:15.980> should<00:02:16.069> have

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
there so I mean I think it should have

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.429 
there so I mean I think it should have
been<00:02:16.310> more<00:02:16.549> age-appropriate<00:02:16.939> and<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.200> just

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
been more age-appropriate and I just

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.539 
been more age-appropriate and I just
feel<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.859> mother<00:02:19.040> did<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.400> for

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
feel like the mother did it for

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.610 
feel like the mother did it for
attention<00:02:19.639> I<00:02:20.090> mean<00:02:20.120> even<00:02:21.049> if<00:02:21.139> she<00:02:21.170> was<00:02:21.409> sent

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
attention I mean even if she was sent

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
attention I mean even if she was sent
out<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.889> classroom<00:02:22.370> there<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.609> news<00:02:22.790> had

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
out of the classroom there the news had

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.819 
out of the classroom there the news had
to<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.269> caught<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.689> this<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.049> mean<00:02:24.349> was<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
to be caught for this I mean was it that

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.199 
to be caught for this I mean was it that
serious<00:02:25.129> that<00:02:25.159> this<00:02:25.340> had<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.579> make<00:02:25.849> national

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
serious that this had to make national

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.280 
serious that this had to make national
news<00:02:26.480> um<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:28.909> also<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.569> don't<00:02:29.840> feel<00:02:30.079> like

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
news um and then also I don't feel like

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.449 
news um and then also I don't feel like
the<00:02:30.409> teacher<00:02:30.620> should<00:02:30.920> have<00:02:31.010> took<00:02:31.189> her<00:02:31.280> out<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the teacher should have took her out the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.670 
the teacher should have took her out the
classroom<00:02:32.000> unless<00:02:32.329> she<00:02:32.450> did<00:02:32.629> something<00:02:32.930> bad<00:02:33.319> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
classroom unless she did something bad I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.259 
classroom unless she did something bad I
think<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.430> was<00:02:34.549> kind<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.849> wrong<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.209> I

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
think that was kind of wrong but I

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.569 
think that was kind of wrong but I
understood<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.959> distraction<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.859> feel<00:02:37.370> like

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
understood the distraction I feel like

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.039 
understood the distraction I feel like
even<00:02:37.760> they<00:02:37.939> shouldn't<00:02:38.239> sent<00:02:38.450> her<00:02:38.569> home<00:02:38.719> and
