going to be talking about gameplay and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.860 
going to be talking about gameplay and
we<00:00:36.620> can't<00:00:36.830> talk<00:00:37.010> about<00:00:37.130> game<00:00:37.370> play<00:00:37.610> without

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
we can't talk about game play without

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.210 
we can't talk about game play without

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.130 
sort of talking about tricks and and
over-the-top<00:00:40.610> environments<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.630> controls

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
over-the-top environments and controls

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.320 
over-the-top environments and controls
and<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.070> key<00:00:43.309> components<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.820> level<00:00:44.059> design

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
and the key components of level design

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.970 
and the key components of level design
so<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:44.809> video<00:00:45.260> we're<00:00:45.500> going<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.650> take<00:00:45.860> you

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
so in this video we're going to take you

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.350 
so in this video we're going to take you
through<00:00:46.010> each<00:00:46.309> one<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.550> those<00:00:46.699> aspects<00:00:47.150> of<00:00:47.270> the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
through each one of those aspects of the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.360 
through each one of those aspects of the
game<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.750> try<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.500> give<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.860> little<00:00:49.010> bit<00:00:49.220> of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
game and try to give you a little bit of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.680 
game and try to give you a little bit of
understanding<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.239> how<00:00:50.270> we're<00:00:50.510> doing<00:00:50.570> things

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
understanding on how we're doing things

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.080 
understanding on how we're doing things
we<00:00:51.350> wanted<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.650> take<00:00:51.920> sort<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.489> all<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.910> old

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
we wanted to take sort of all of the old

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.600 
we wanted to take sort of all of the old
SSX<00:00:53.690> levels<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.320> rather<00:00:54.980> than<00:00:55.129> have<00:00:55.370> anything

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
SSX levels and rather than have anything

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.850 
SSX levels and rather than have anything
defense<00:00:56.180> tour<00:00:56.449> gated<00:00:56.870> or<00:00:57.050> blocked<00:00:57.379> we<00:00:57.590> wanted

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
defense tour gated or blocked we wanted

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.380 
defense tour gated or blocked we wanted
to<00:00:57.949> basically<00:00:58.100> turn<00:00:58.489> every<00:00:58.850> square<00:00:59.150> inch<00:00:59.300> of

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
to basically turn every square inch of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.639 
to basically turn every square inch of
the<00:00:59.510> level<00:00:59.780> into<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.079> sort<00:01:00.410> of<00:01:00.440> three

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
the level into a sort of three

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.380 
the level into a sort of three
dimensional<00:01:01.100> physics<00:01:01.250> playground<00:01:01.910> it's<00:01:02.270> all

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
dimensional physics playground it's all

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.290 
dimensional physics playground it's all
really<00:01:02.630> part<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:02.960> making<00:01:03.350> awesome<00:01:03.530> easy<00:01:04.300> you

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
really part of making awesome easy you

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.040 
really part of making awesome easy you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
look so natural there Dave what are we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.389 
look so natural there Dave what are we
looking<00:01:09.259> at<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.500> clip<00:01:09.800> here<00:01:10.009> alright<00:01:10.280> so

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
looking at in this clip here alright so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.100 
looking at in this clip here alright so
here<00:01:10.550> we<00:01:10.700> see<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> case<00:01:11.060> where<00:01:11.300> I'm<00:01:11.630> coming<00:01:11.990> off

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
here we see a case where I'm coming off

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.719 
here we see a case where I'm coming off
the<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.380> mountain<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.220> I've<00:01:13.340> got<00:01:13.520> some

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
the the mountain and I've got some

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.780 
the the mountain and I've got some
angular<00:01:14.300> momentum<00:01:15.259> when<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.380> come<00:01:15.590> off<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.070> so

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
angular momentum when I come off and so

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.120 
angular momentum when I come off and so
I'm<00:01:17.330> getting<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.990> situation<00:01:18.830> where<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.100> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
I'm getting a situation where I want to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.560 
I'm getting a situation where I want to
preserve<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.670> angular<00:01:19.910> momentum<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.390> have<00:01:20.539> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
preserve the angular momentum and have a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.560 
preserve the angular momentum and have a
role<00:01:20.899> as<00:01:21.350> he<00:01:21.470> comes<00:01:21.680> off<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.820> i<00:01:22.880> guess<00:01:23.060> rolling

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
role as he comes off so i guess rolling

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.420 
role as he comes off so i guess rolling
and<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:24.740> want<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.979> make<00:01:25.070> sure<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.340> i<00:01:25.399> can

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
and then we want to make sure that i can

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.340 
and then we want to make sure that i can
get<00:01:25.610> my<00:01:25.700> crowd<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.360> make<00:01:27.050> sure<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.200> i<00:01:27.320> can

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
get my crowd and make sure that i can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.529 
get my crowd and make sure that i can
land<00:01:27.740> nice<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.430> easy<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.850> stick<00:01:29.090> my<00:01:29.240> landing

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
land nice and easy and stick my landing

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.359 
land nice and easy and stick my landing
nice<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:29.869> tight<00:01:30.020> there<00:01:30.320> yeah<00:01:30.890> that's<00:01:31.190> awesome

could do is actually just show you some
of<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.800> tricks<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.100> we're<00:01:37.340> working<00:01:37.459> on<00:01:37.729> so

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
of the tricks that we're working on so

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.430
