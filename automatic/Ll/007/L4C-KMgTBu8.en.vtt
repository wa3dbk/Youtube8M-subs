00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
one of these options here look at the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
one of these options here look at the
roof<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.450> change<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> pattern<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
roof you can change the pattern and the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
roof you can change the pattern and the
roof<00:01:43.950> lining<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.479> sparkly

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
roof lining and this one has sparkly

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.039 
roof lining and this one has sparkly
nighttime<00:01:47.009> sky<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.810> stars

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
nighttime sky look there's little stars

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
nighttime sky look there's little stars
a<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> rolls-royce<00:01:50.640> phantom

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a bit like on a rolls-royce phantom

unfortunately<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> similarities<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
unfortunately the similarities with the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
unfortunately the similarities with the
rolls-royce<00:01:54.960> keep<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> end<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.280> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
rolls-royce keep a kind of end when you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.810 
rolls-royce keep a kind of end when you
get<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.299> obviously

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
get into the back because obviously

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.390 
get into the back because obviously
it's<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.150> quite<00:01:59.390> as<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.630> roommate<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.590> fact<00:02:00.980> I

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
it's not quite as a roommate in fact I

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.740 
it's not quite as a roommate in fact I
have<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.730> say<00:02:01.940> I'm<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.300> bit

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
have to say I'm a little bit

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.030 
have to say I'm a little bit
disappointed<00:02:02.930> with<00:02:03.410> space<00:02:03.650> here<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.010> back

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
disappointed with space here in the back

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.850 
disappointed with space here in the back
I<00:02:04.370> was<00:02:04.520> hoping<00:02:05.450> for<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:05.990> bigger<00:02:06.590> than<00:02:06.800> a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I was hoping for it to be bigger than a

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.620 
I was hoping for it to be bigger than a
mini<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:07.370> it<00:02:07.490> doesn't<00:02:07.760> feel<00:02:07.880> like<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.420> it's

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
mini but it doesn't feel like it is it's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.600 
mini but it doesn't feel like it is it's
pretty<00:02:08.960> cramped<00:02:09.320> this<00:02:09.680> seat<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.190> my<00:02:10.280> normal

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
pretty cramped this seat is in my normal

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090 
pretty cramped this seat is in my normal
driving<00:02:10.850> position<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.540> well<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.500> couldn't<00:02:12.950> get

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
driving position and well I couldn't get

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.070 
driving position and well I couldn't get
particularly<00:02:13.310> far<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.150> I've<00:02:14.930> got

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
particularly far like this like I've got

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.620 
particularly far like this like I've got
no<00:02:15.230> room<00:02:15.410> at<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.070> back<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.240> noticed

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
no room at all and back here you noticed

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.230 
no room at all and back here you noticed
the<00:02:17.840> quality<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> materials<00:02:19.240> aren't

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
the quality of the materials aren't

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.970 
the quality of the materials aren't
quite<00:02:20.480> up<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> scratch<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.650> what<00:02:21.800> they're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
quite up to the scratch and what they're

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.670 
quite up to the scratch and what they're
like<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.730> front<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.930> atom<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.260> based<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
like in the front the atom is based on a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.140 
like in the front the atom is based on a
slightly<00:02:24.980> shorter<00:02:25.070> version<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> platform

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
slightly shorter version of the platform

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.080 
slightly shorter version of the platform
which<00:02:26.540> will<00:02:26.660> underpin<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.530> next<00:02:27.890> Corsa<00:02:28.460> it's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
which will underpin the next Corsa it's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.430 
which will underpin the next Corsa it's
actually<00:02:29.360> wider<00:02:29.600> than<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.930> mini<00:02:30.080> which<00:02:30.290> would

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
actually wider than a mini which would

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.140 
actually wider than a mini which would
help<00:02:30.590> road-holding<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.640> let<00:02:31.790> me<00:02:31.850> just<00:02:32.000> check

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
help road-holding but let me just check

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.550 
help road-holding but let me just check
something<00:02:32.360> out<00:02:34.030> yeah<00:02:35.030> unfortunately<00:02:35.560> it's

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
something out yeah unfortunately it's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.140 
something out yeah unfortunately it's
got<00:02:36.710> quite<00:02:36.950> unsophisticated<00:02:37.430> rear

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
got quite unsophisticated rear

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.580 
got quite unsophisticated rear
suspension<00:02:38.660> doesn't<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:38.930> multi-link<00:02:39.410> like

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
suspension doesn't have multi-link like

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.960 
suspension doesn't have multi-link like
the<00:02:39.680> mini<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.010> I'm<00:02:40.100> not<00:02:40.340> sure<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.880> going

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
the mini so I'm not sure that it's going

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.360 
the mini so I'm not sure that it's going
to<00:02:41.060> handle<00:02:41.270> quite<00:02:41.660> as<00:02:41.810> well<00:02:42.020> also<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.980> engines

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
to handle quite as well also the engines

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.740 
to handle quite as well also the engines
aren't<00:02:43.610> quite<00:02:43.820> sophisticated<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
aren't quite sophisticated as the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.170 
aren't quite sophisticated as the
minutes<00:02:45.020> you've<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.590> normal<00:02:46.340> 1.2<00:02:46.970> litre

minutes you've got a normal 1.2 litre

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180

in by pressing the badge well do you
know<00:03:04.340> what<00:03:04.550> it's<00:03:04.820> not<00:03:05.390> too<00:03:05.630> bad<00:03:05.930> really<00:03:06.140> for

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
know what it's not too bad really for

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.530 
know what it's not too bad really for
the<00:03:07.430> car<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.880> size<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.850> then<00:03:11.030> what<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.510> I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
the car of this size so then what do I

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.479 
the car of this size so then what do I
think<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.870> little<00:03:12.050> car<00:03:12.370> we're<00:03:13.370> like

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
think of this little car we're like

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.090 
think of this little car we're like
really<00:03:14.090> quite<00:03:14.450> like<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.870> actually<00:03:14.989> my<00:03:15.830> only

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
really quite like it actually my only

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.370 
really quite like it actually my only
problem<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.700> think<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.300> naming<00:03:17.570> strategies

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
problem I think is the naming strategies

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.780 
problem I think is the naming strategies
right<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.860> three<00:03:19.070> trim<00:03:19.310> levels<00:03:19.340> they're

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
right the three trim levels they're
