00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
towards each other at the end of the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.860 
towards each other at the end of the
fight<00:04:02.490> like<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:03.000> were<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.360> battle<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.660> gods

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
fight like they were in battle of gods

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
another difference that i want to point

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.550 
another difference that i want to point
out<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.600> vegeta<00:04:13.020> wasn't<00:04:13.290> actually

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
out was that vegeta wasn't actually

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.500 
out was that vegeta wasn't actually
training<00:04:13.980> what<00:04:14.459> King<00:04:14.670> Kai<00:04:14.850> was<00:04:15.000> talking<00:04:15.360> to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
training what King Kai was talking to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.720 
training what King Kai was talking to
him<00:04:15.660> he<00:04:16.260> was<00:04:16.350> actually<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.310> party<00:04:17.669> you

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
him he was actually at the party you

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.400 
him he was actually at the party you
know<00:04:17.790> explaining<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.660> relaxing

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
know explaining there and relaxing

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.440 
know explaining there and relaxing
which<00:04:19.799> kind<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.070> contradicts<00:04:20.580> what<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.330> know

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
I guess we says in resurrection F about

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.090 
I guess we says in resurrection F about
Vegeta<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.110> resting<00:04:25.470> enough<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.860> wonder

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100
