 Easy- to- use, hard- to -see blue 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.420
 Because there must be six tags 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.420

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:20.000
 I wonder if this will be my initial assault 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.860
 I think that it was a tableware life that was put out on the screen of the first person's assault . 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.470
