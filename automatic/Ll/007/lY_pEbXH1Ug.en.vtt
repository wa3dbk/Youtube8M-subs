a chump
up<00:01:16.340> there<00:01:16.610> you're<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.810> pop<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.170> in

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
up there you're going to pop that in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.050 
up there you're going to pop that in
there

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
there

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.740 
there
down<00:01:20.060> here<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:21.950> just<00:01:22.130> tape<00:01:22.400> this<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.940> how

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
down here you can just tape this and how

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.320 
down here you can just tape this and how
long<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.730> need<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:25.970> long

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
long this is you just need it long

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.120 
long this is you just need it long
enough<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:26.930> then<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.230> rabbit<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.950> get

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
enough so then the rabbit can get

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.300 
enough so then the rabbit can get
through<00:01:28.370> here<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:30.110> in<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.200> way<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.380> just<00:01:30.860> put<00:01:31.130> this

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
through here so in a way I just put this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.020 
through here so in a way I just put this
on<00:01:31.580> right<00:01:31.760> here<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.390> extra<00:01:33.430> support<00:01:34.430> for<00:01:34.880> it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
on right here for extra support for it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.650 
on right here for extra support for it
and<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.230> it's<00:01:36.680> just<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.820> same<00:01:37.850> thing<00:01:38.090> like

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
and so it's just the same thing like

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.850 
and so it's just the same thing like
half<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:39.260> did<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.560> then

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
half I did this that like that and then

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.440 
half I did this that like that and then
the<00:01:43.100> rest<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.550> way<00:01:44.020> like<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.530> big<00:01:46.450> right

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the rest of the way like this big right

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.550 
the rest of the way like this big right
there<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.230> fits<00:01:48.410> in<00:01:48.650> nicely<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:51.380> it's

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
there so then it fits in nicely and it's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.820 
there so then it fits in nicely and it's
flat<00:01:51.890> with<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:53.050> so<00:01:54.050> anyway<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.330> cut

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
flat with that so anyway and then I cut

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.270 
flat with that so anyway and then I cut
two<00:01:57.830> doors<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:59.450> here<00:01:59.900> then<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.860> made<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.040> so

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
two doors one here then I made it so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.170 
two doors one here then I made it so
that<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.520> goes<00:02:01.720> up<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.380> around<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.100> down<00:02:04.180> this

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
that it goes up and around and down this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.270 
that it goes up and around and down this
way<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.690> was<00:02:06.110> planning<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.620> have<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.100> right<00:02:07.220> here

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
way I was planning to have it right here

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.759 
way I was planning to have it right here
but<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:07.940> thought<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.420> don't<00:02:09.050> kind<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.349> look<00:02:09.410> kind

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
but I thought I don't kind of look kind

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.869 
but I thought I don't kind of look kind
of<00:02:09.860> better<00:02:10.009> on<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> side<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.629> did<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.019> I

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
of better on the side so I did that I

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.660 
of better on the side so I did that I
wanted<00:02:13.879> anyway<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.629> box<00:02:14.989> is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
wanted anyway this box is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.290 
wanted anyway this box is
fifteen<00:02:17.670> inches<00:02:18.210> by<00:02:20.570> 17<00:02:21.570> inches<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
fifteen inches by 17 inches and it is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.470 
fifteen inches by 17 inches and it is
strong<00:02:24.780> enough<00:02:25.340> probably<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.490> hold<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
strong enough probably to hold the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050 
strong enough probably to hold the
rabbit<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.960> top<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> wanted<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.580> put

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
rabbit on top so if you wanted to put

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.620 
rabbit on top so if you wanted to put
anything<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.280> top<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.000> toy<00:02:33.420> or

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
anything on the top like a little toy or

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.190 
anything on the top like a little toy or
whatever<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.420> way<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:37.110> have
