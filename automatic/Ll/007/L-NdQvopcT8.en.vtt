00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.070
 How are you friends in this video? 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.190
 I present an excellent rom for the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.360
 galaxy s2 it's about the infinity rom or 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.540
 infinite with android 4.1.2 as they can 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.540
 watch 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.510
 carries the well-known apollo kernel 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.510
 and the version of the rom those 6.1 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.120
 we can choose between the native unter the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.120
 samsung or the latex launcher 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 We have up to 24 quick accesses from 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.320
 the notification panel 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.990
 and two buttons on the status bar one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.429
 to block the terminal and the other that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.429
 fulfills the function of the start button 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 the ink from the screen effect 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.729
 Lock is available and you can choose 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.729
 between different colors 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.600
 as well as we have the effect 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 of undulating water 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 the gallery the same as the galaxy s3 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 remember that if you want to install this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.850
 rom will find in the description of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.479
 video all the information needed to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.479
 install now 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.650
 we can use the pop-up browser 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.790
 at the same time we do other 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.790
 functions in the terminal 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.870
 explanation imported to the galaxy not that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.050
 It can be very useful for some 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 people 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.040
 another interesting option is that we can 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.180
 take pictures with the buttons 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.180
 camera physicists 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.190
 We also have several options for 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.190
 Audio 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 thanks to the apollo kernel we can 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.680
 modify several options that have to 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.350
 see with the performance of our 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.300
 terminal as for example we can 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.870
 change how often the 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.870
 processor 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.160
 option to customize access 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.000
 quick ones that are in the panel 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.000
 notifications 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.479
 the options available from the menu j 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.479
 we will see them last 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.100
 multi transparent window that counts 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.100
 with all the installed applications 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.770
 task manager with a 3d effect 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.860
 access to the often is depends on the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.750
 internet connection speed of 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.750
 each one and it's not the rom itself 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.370
 here we will find updates for 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.110
 the rom and a long list of mods 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.820
 divided into categories for 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.240
 customize even more our 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.240
 terminal 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.010
 so 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.010
 to
