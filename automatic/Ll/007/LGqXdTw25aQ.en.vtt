00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
riding this on so this one for my weight

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.459 
riding this on so this one for my weight
and<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> bike<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:44.160> st<00:00:44.550> one

with the with this super-heavy hub in
the<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.020> made<00:00:49.260> sense<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the back it made sense that this was the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.529 
the back it made sense that this was the
most<00:00:50.550> comfortable<00:00:52.520> spot<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.270> ride

too<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> guys<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> pretty

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
too as you guys all know it's a pretty

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.540 
too as you guys all know it's a pretty
long<00:00:57.120> commute<00:00:57.480> 80<00:00:57.719> kilometers<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> day<00:00:58.550> rolling

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
long commute 80 kilometers a day rolling

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.599 
long commute 80 kilometers a day rolling
this<00:00:59.670> thing<00:00:59.730> out<00:01:00.320> paved<00:01:01.320> roads<00:01:01.620> fairly

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this thing out paved roads fairly

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.119 
this thing out paved roads fairly
straight<00:01:02.820> line<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.690> made<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.080> sense<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.739> me

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
straight line it made more sense for me

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.800 
straight line it made more sense for me
to<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
to have it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.359 
to have it
pre-loaded<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.080> loaded<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.619> actual

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
pre-loaded so it's loaded to my actual

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
pre-loaded so it's loaded to my actual
weight<00:01:08.869> which<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.930> 180<00:01:10.439> pounds<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.100> also

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
weight which is 180 pounds which also

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
weight which is 180 pounds which also
means<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.020> black

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
means that I've got these two black

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.780 
means that I've got these two black
Springs<00:01:13.619> there's<00:01:14.040> different<00:01:14.369> colors<00:01:14.520> I'll

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Springs there's different colors I'll

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.810 
Springs there's different colors I'll
get<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> review<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
get into that and the review as well and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.039 
get into that and the review as well and
there's<00:01:17.820> dampeners<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> ends<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.960> all

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
there's dampeners on the ends it's all

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.450 
there's dampeners on the ends it's all
quite<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.380> quite<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.560> high<00:01:20.009> performance

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
hook up the camera to the back and I'll

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
hook up the camera to the back and I'll
you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> watch<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> motion<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.750> see

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you can watch it in motion you can see

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can watch it in motion you can see
how<00:01:28.400> little<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.619> weight<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.159> affected

by<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> bikes<00:01:33.600> movements<00:01:34.100> which<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.310> pretty

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
by the bikes movements which is pretty

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
by the bikes movements which is pretty
huge<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> unsprung<00:01:36.840> weight<00:01:36.900> back

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
huge because this unsprung weight back

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
huge because this unsprung weight back
here<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.670> thing<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> gives<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> fun

anyways and enjoy try to focus on the
machine<00:01:53.040> moving

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.650 

we<00:02:28.980> saw<00:02:29.280> how<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:30.050> isolated<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.610> my<00:02:32.610> body<00:02:33.360> weight

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
we saw how it isolated my my body weight

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.060 
we saw how it isolated my my body weight
up<00:02:33.900> above<00:02:34.350> all<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.280> action<00:02:35.700> going<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.570> below

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
up above all the action going on below

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.340 
up above all the action going on below
that<00:02:38.070> saves<00:02:38.370> me<00:02:38.610> huge<00:02:38.910> I've<00:02:39.210> put<00:02:39.480> about<00:02:39.660> 160

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that saves me huge I've put about 160
