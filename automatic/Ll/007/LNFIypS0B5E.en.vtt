00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 we move the bar 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.860
 up to where it says 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 maybe percent 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 the Serbian does not interest us only is who 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.370
 next tanus 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.920

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 that's why it's a little purple 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 but while all that happens we can go 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.259
 talking a little bit about the utility of the torrent client tool 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 this tool will serve us more than anything 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.049
 for the clear nastic about crooks who are charging more than we deny and is 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.959
 that as a web server 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.269

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.249
 we play with them they prefer that they finish the installation 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.529
 let's go to 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.909
 I hope it ends 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.909

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.729
 we should only correct as soon as 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.729
 I know many who want to know anything 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.059
 but he is not in bed yet 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.669
 we hope this also 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.439
 now let's start 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.599
 if we open the dialog of preserves where a setback of rent cost command of 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.879
 windows 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.929
 spy stimuli with so clever 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.519

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.579
 once concluded 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 I hit 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.329
 as we have put 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.329
 this is working perfectly 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 the client 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.479
 it's not manuel anymore 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.719
 it's like a very simple solution 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.479
 that is going to provide us with a tool the counts a lot was like that
