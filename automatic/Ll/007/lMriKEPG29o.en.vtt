00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
behold we have a lot of demos here so

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.430 
behold we have a lot of demos here so
i'll<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:34.390> i'll<00:00:34.600> start<00:00:34.810> off<00:00:34.900> with<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.140> demo

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
i'll do i'll start off with this demo

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.380 
i'll do i'll start off with this demo
this<00:00:35.560> is<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.920> sort<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.760> introductory<00:00:37.090> one

this is the sort of the introductory one

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.870 
this is the sort of the introductory one
that<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:37.600> have<00:00:37.750> yeah<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.250> an<00:00:39.489> augmented

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
that we have yeah this is an augmented

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.460 
that we have yeah this is an augmented
reality<00:00:40.300> demo<00:00:40.480> where<00:00:40.780> I'm<00:00:41.020> overlaying

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
reality demo where I'm overlaying

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.729 
reality demo where I'm overlaying
objects<00:00:41.920> onto<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.730> controllers<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.320> since

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
objects onto the controllers so since

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
objects onto the controllers so since
the<00:00:44.860> PlayStation<00:00:45.370> Eye<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.550> tracking<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the PlayStation Eye is tracking the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.170 
the PlayStation Eye is tracking the
objects<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:47.770> know<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.400> move<00:00:48.699> controllers

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
objects you know the to move controllers

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.540 
objects you know the to move controllers
yeah<00:00:49.420> we<00:00:49.629> can<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:50.980> sort<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.280> thing<00:00:51.340> in

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
yeah we can do this sort of thing in

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.640 
yeah we can do this sort of thing in
full<00:00:51.730> 3d<00:00:51.760> space<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.600> as<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.900> get<00:00:53.050> closer<00:00:53.260> the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
full 3d space so as I get closer the

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.180 
full 3d space so as I get closer the
object<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.100> bigger<00:00:54.809> wow<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:56.410> know<00:00:56.500> it's<00:00:57.070> all

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
object is bigger wow you know it's all

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.920 
object is bigger wow you know it's all
very<00:00:57.400> fast<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:57.879> with<00:00:58.030> us<00:00:58.150> so<00:00:58.390> no<00:00:58.570> matter<00:00:58.690> how

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
very fast in with us so no matter how

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.040 
very fast in with us so no matter how
fast<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.350> nodes<00:00:59.760> right<00:01:00.760> on<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:01.960> can

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
fast that nodes right on so I can

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.890 
fast that nodes right on so I can
actually<00:01:02.380> see

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
actually see

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.940 
actually see
without<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.990> danger<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.290> slicing<00:01:06.680> open<00:01:06.740> you

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
without the danger of slicing open you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.640 
without the danger of slicing open you
exactly<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.150> what's<00:01:08.780> happening<00:01:09.140> technically

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
exactly so what's happening technically

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.590 
exactly so what's happening technically
behind<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.070> scenes<00:01:10.310> there<00:01:10.580> what's<00:01:11.479> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
behind the scenes there what's the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.730 
behind the scenes there what's the
camera<00:01:11.750> doing<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.229> house<00:01:12.350> are<00:01:12.500> kicking

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
camera doing the house are kicking

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.889 
camera doing the house are kicking
things<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.820> camera<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.210> looking<00:01:14.450> for

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
things up so the camera is looking for

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.429 
things up so the camera is looking for
these<00:01:15.549> colored<00:01:16.549> spheres<00:01:16.820> yeah<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.140> spears

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
these colored spheres yeah so the spears

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.770 
these colored spheres yeah so the spears
are<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.860> know<00:01:18.920> we<00:01:19.040> know<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.520> spear<00:01:19.789> size<00:01:20.060> so

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
are you know we know the spear size so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.539 
are you know we know the spear size so
by<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.619> can<00:01:21.770> infer<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.130> definitely

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
by that we can infer the definitely

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.600 
by that we can infer the definitely
image<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.500> by<00:01:24.500> secures<00:01:24.860> color<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.460> tell

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
image and by secures color we can tell

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.190 
image and by secures color we can tell
them<00:01:25.729> apart<00:01:25.789> it'll<00:01:26.479> told<00:01:26.720> us<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.960> tell<00:01:27.080> them

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
them apart it'll told us and tell them

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.279 
them apart it'll told us and tell them
apart<00:01:27.289> from<00:01:27.649> background<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.000> that's<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
apart from background so that's the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.130 
apart from background so that's the
position<00:01:30.500> tracking<00:01:30.890> portion<00:01:31.549> of<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.729> system

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
position tracking portion of the system

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.050 
position tracking portion of the system
internally<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.979> new<00:01:34.399> controller<00:01:34.789> there's

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
internally to the new controller there's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.330 
internally to the new controller there's
also<00:01:35.289> accelerometers<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.319> gyroscopes<00:01:37.069> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
also accelerometers and gyroscopes and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.999 
also accelerometers and gyroscopes and
those<00:01:37.850> are<00:01:38.000> responsible<00:01:38.659> for<00:01:38.690> sort<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.619> eating

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
those are responsible for sort of eating

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.180 
those are responsible for sort of eating
the<00:01:40.039> quick<00:01:40.340> movements<00:01:40.819> I'm<00:01:41.030> also<00:01:41.270> aiding<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
the quick movements I'm also aiding the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.880 
the quick movements I'm also aiding the
rotation<00:01:43.190> device

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.490 

kind<00:01:48.890> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 

by<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.790> calibration

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
by the way this is the calibration

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
by the way this is the calibration
process<00:01:58.010> basically<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.310> user<00:01:59.460> would<00:01:59.670> point

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
process basically the user would point

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.460 
process basically the user would point
the<00:02:00.060> device<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.450> camera<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> press<00:02:01.440> a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
the device at the camera and press a

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.620 
the device at the camera and press a
button<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:02.940> you're<00:02:03.360> sort<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
button and that's it so you're sort of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.180 
button and that's it so you're sort of
back<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.050> game<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.440> it's<00:02:04.890> very<00:02:05.010> easy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
back in the game so it's very easy

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.880 
back in the game so it's very easy
there's<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.790> there's<00:02:06.690> not<00:02:06.840> long<00:02:07.140> steps

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
there's not like there's not long steps

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.790 
there's not like there's not long steps
you<00:02:08.070> have<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.340> take<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.530> do<00:02:10.530> any<00:02:10.679> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you have to take to actually do any of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
you have to take to actually do any of
this<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.400> bait<00:02:11.580> pit<00:02:11.820> picking<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.600> color

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
this so is it bait pit picking the color

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.120 
this so is it bait pit picking the color
based<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> background<00:02:13.470> yeah<00:02:14.010> it's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
based on the background yeah it's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
based on the background yeah it's
picking<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> color<00:02:14.640> based<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
picking the color based on the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.730 
picking the color based on the
background<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.050> based<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
background and you know based on the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.110 
background and you know based on the
other<00:02:16.860> controllers<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.520> scene<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.000> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
other controllers in the scene so it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.490 
other controllers in the scene so it
can't<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:18.990> can't<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> same

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
can't be you know they can't be the same

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000 
can't be you know they can't be the same
controller

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.960 

it's<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.489> up<00:02:24.700> top

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.550 

make<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.660> greatest<00:02:27.870> controller<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
make the greatest controller in the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.699 
make the greatest controller in the
world<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.010> no<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:29.970> does<00:02:30.690> anything

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.649 

so<00:02:35.709> in<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:35.920> demo<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.340> use<00:02:36.489> head<00:02:36.670> tracking<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
so in this demo we use head tracking and

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.160 
so in this demo we use head tracking and
you<00:02:38.319> know<00:02:38.409> this<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:38.769> years

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
you know this is two years

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.470 
you know this is two years
done<00:02:39.410> way<00:02:39.590> back<00:02:39.740> actually<00:02:40.580> no

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
done way back actually no

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.699 
done way back actually no
and<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:44.129> trying<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.610> hands<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and you know I'm trying my hands and the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.140 
and you know I'm trying my hands and the
triggers<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.159> actually<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:47.849> only<00:02:47.879> nice

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
triggers are actually not only nice

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.759 
triggers are actually not only nice
thing<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.480> love<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.930> map<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.379> hand

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
thing I love so I map to the hand

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.649 
thing I love so I map to the hand
position<00:02:49.950> yep<00:02:50.519> cycling<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.299> kind<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.599> like

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
position yep cycling is kind of like

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.690 
position yep cycling is kind of like
scratching<00:02:52.440> motion<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.190> you're<00:02:53.340> doing<00:02:53.459> that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
scratching motion so you're doing that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.539 
scratching motion so you're doing that
with<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.940> trigger<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.750> trigger<00:02:55.549> and

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
with the trigger do with the trigger and

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.399 
with the trigger do with the trigger and
I<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.090> kind<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> boxing<00:02:57.810> game<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:57.959> you

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
I can kind of do a boxing game so you

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.289 
I can kind of do a boxing game so you
don't<00:02:58.560> slice<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.980> quick<00:02:59.190> cameras<00:02:59.879> at<00:03:00.030> 60

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
don't slice and quick cameras at 60

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.360 
don't slice and quick cameras at 60
frames<00:03:00.330> per<00:03:00.569> second<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> allows<00:03:01.769> us<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.250> do

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
frames per second so it allows us to do

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.750 
frames per second so it allows us to do
very<00:03:02.610> very<00:03:02.879> precisely<00:03:03.569> which<00:03:03.989> emotion

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
very very precisely which emotion

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.819 
very very precisely which emotion
affection<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> traffic<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.440> don't

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
affection to the traffic and you don't

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.470 
affection to the traffic and you don't
have<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.069> do<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:11.400> our<00:03:11.430> method<00:03:11.760> realities

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.170 

reality<00:03:15.790> camera

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.910 

Oh

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920
