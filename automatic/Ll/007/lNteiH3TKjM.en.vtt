00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.619
 I am a student ready bomana study on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.240
 appliance construction faculty 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 a specialty me 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.510
 Vanga launch missile systems 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.680
 set because I kinda know what 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 there heard at least that there 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 very friendly volt setting that all 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.370
 help each other is not something that is there 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.790
 such stereotypes that everything is there . of such 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.570
 bounty type affected evil here they are on 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 really very sociable and 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 interesting people 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.329
 Well, I do not know Well, of course I thought others 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.309
 institutions in which I filed 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.280
 documents 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.469
 be able to know here but it is bound 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.469
 certainly not closer maybe 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.470
 at school I studied like everything seems to me 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 students sit at 50 on as usual did 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.940
 focus on just finding the subject which 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.160
 you will give and so forth 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.060
 regular 10th grade 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.729
 no way 11 started practicing and thinking about 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 the fact that there are serious courses 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.080
 I found how I was just looking on the Internet 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 we googled 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.140
 just but the course preparing for the exam there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.990
 I was highlighted school I want to know not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.800
 I don't use this lock 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.780
 she went to call 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.970
 I met Dasha will even be me 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.320
 said of course they came here I came and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.440
 I described myself doing math physics 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.050
 I studied physics Dmitry Pobedinskaya 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 and math was engaged in asus 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.509
 first class I came to dime 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.340
 mean now began seriously so 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.420
 Here then started a joke there inside you know 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.470
 but the jokes of the physicists are there or of my last 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.790
 you will become so pretty that's not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.280
 I know how it became with them very much 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.190
 interesting on physics there too 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.819
 various devices were 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.569
 connections 8 millimeters all this so 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.600
 that's when Dima brought us something and we 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.580
 tried to connect everything so that we 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.700
 I earned the same God that there was 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.680
 some kind of mechanism was or light bulb on 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.319
 whether it caught fire or something was spinning 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.860
 But at such moments it was interesting 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.870
 we are all 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.280
 and how these 8 8 cleaner that is if 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.010
 keeps and how you connect everything and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.330
 you understand that it works for you and it 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.250
 great but I do nâ€™t know everything myself 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.650
 very accessible explains asking there 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.330
 a lot of joy helps and everything is yes there and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.400
 you get for example and when you with 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.670
 She decides an example here then on you 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.489
 gives another to you he gets it 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.180
 such it is probably a bust, but it 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 very cool right here is nice 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.290
 very easy to explain I don't know 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.060
 I seem to be a teacher who 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.060
 explains the subject like this 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.030
 never thought of individual 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.319
 I had a very sad experience 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.799
 I just practiced 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.400
 Well, with a man carbon fiber doctor of science all 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.930
 things are up to a physicist but it was very fashionable then 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.469
 have you come to him before 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.090
 model assignment you make him come 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.209
 show you will explain something 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.889
 other I mean it seems to me like that but 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.370
 not that itâ€™s not interesting 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.769
 bored and here you sit with a group if you 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.530
 you do not understand you are sitting friend who 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.469
 he doesn't understand it either and he asks how 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.700
 Well I would not know it seems to me to engage in 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.669
 group is much more interesting than 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.989
 individually because it's like 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.690
 first find yourself new friends and 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.220
 you seem like a huge plus it seems to me 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.220
 found a large number of friends 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.569
 This I gave physics of course on 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.090
 Russian subjects and did not give up 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.490
 subconscious at that time I think that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.419
 the game is the worst thing that can do 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.669
 happen on because the game type 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.789
 level what type all the state 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.759
 network I think it's worse than the game not be 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.870
 maybe but now when i will be soon 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:14.030
 session I understand that Igor is this nonsense 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:16.460
 and said that the banks are hard in the bank 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.849
 certainly hard certainly hard 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.509
 like to study like this because 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.279
 very useful to you 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.650
 for example math is very useful to you 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.099
 mathematics physics has no ambition and 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.469
 here it will be instead of the second semester 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:36.919
 on physics is also very difficult laboratory 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:41.210
 work there so you need to study madly 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.979
 I wonder how you come understand 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.000
 that you just feel like a fish in 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.000
 water is true
