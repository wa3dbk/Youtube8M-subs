00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.170 
and we start using different words
different<00:03:35.130> adjectives<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.150> describe

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
different adjectives to describe

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.569 
different adjectives to describe
chocolate<00:03:37.139> than<00:03:37.290> when<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.769> use<00:03:37.889> a<00:03:38.340> water

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
chocolate than when you use a water

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.909 
chocolate than when you use a water
ganache<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.510> with<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.169> water<00:03:40.290> ganache<00:03:40.769> we

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
ganache now with the water ganache we

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.740 
ganache now with the water ganache we
use<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.250> oh<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.579> really<00:03:41.760> light<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.389> clean

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
use the oh that's really light and clean

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.420 
use the oh that's really light and clean
and<00:03:43.079> refreshing<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:44.100> know<00:03:44.130> there's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
and refreshing you know there's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.190 
and refreshing you know there's
different<00:03:44.790> ways<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> express<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> then<00:03:46.109> we

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
different ways to express it and then we

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.199 
different ways to express it and then we
start<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.650> relate<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> chocolate

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
start to relate to that so the chocolate

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.900 
start to relate to that so the chocolate
differently<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.230> water<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.769> -<00:03:49.919> really<00:03:50.340> it's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
differently the water can - really it's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.330 
differently the water can - really it's
a<00:03:51.060> technique<00:03:51.389> only<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.380> use<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:52.859> quality
