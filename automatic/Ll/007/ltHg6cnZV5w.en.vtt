of<00:01:02.430> efr<00:01:02.879> turbochargers<00:01:03.660> well<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> answer<00:01:04.260> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
of efr turbochargers well the answer is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.550 
of efr turbochargers well the answer is
quite<00:01:04.530> simple<00:01:04.979> budget<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.110> fact<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
quite simple budget the fact of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
quite simple budget the fact of the
matter<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> many<00:01:08.610> people<00:01:08.939> today<00:01:09.210> are

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
matter is that many people today are

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
matter is that many people today are
pulling<00:01:10.320> their<00:01:10.470> turbochargers<00:01:11.369> turbo

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pulling their turbochargers turbo

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
pulling their turbochargers turbo
systems<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> L<00:01:13.409> n<00:01:13.590> FS<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> they're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
systems off of the L n FS and they're

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
systems off of the L n FS and they're
upgrading<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> e<00:01:15.869> fr<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.770> larger

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
upgrading them to the e fr and larger

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
upgrading them to the e fr and larger
turbo<00:01:17.670> setups<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> does<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
turbo setups so what that does is it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
turbo setups so what that does is it
creates<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.250> surplus<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.090> gently-used

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
creates a surplus of gently-used

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.370 
creates a surplus of gently-used
om<00:01:23.100> parts<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.840> budget<00:01:28.170> minded

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
om parts so for the budget minded

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.280 
om parts so for the budget minded
consumer<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> great<00:01:30.600> first

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

step<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.950> forced<00:01:32.400> induction<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> let's<00:01:34.320> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
step into forced induction so let's just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
step into forced induction so let's just
take<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> walk<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.310> car<00:01:35.490> real<00:01:35.729> quick<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
take a walk around the car real quick so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
take a walk around the car real quick so
