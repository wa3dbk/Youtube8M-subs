00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.830
 the high technology that is applied for the 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.710
 egg production not only for the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.049
 internal consumption not abroad 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 carried out in the country with high standards 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.420
 that allow to pack more than 2 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.400
 and a half million eggs a day one 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.890
 figure that places us in a position 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 privileged with respect to the region 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 appealing to digital technology and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 various equipment can detect with the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.329
 eye system copy yes in the product 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.270
 there are for example traces of blood or 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 decomposition processes 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.680
 imperceptible to the human eye what 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.530
 allows a high quality index in the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.530
 consumption 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.719
 it is a tool to be able to understand 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.340
 this bridge of communication with the mistress 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.440
 from home and through each egg 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.000
 transmit the peace of mind that 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.850
 these eggs have been produced from a 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.170
 healthy way with food always 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.300
 natural 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.159
 and that have been precious in very few 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.770
 days and we have been working very hard 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.290
 in improving quality improve the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.520
 classification of the eggs improve the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.369
 Delivery times to make it eggs 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.649
 extremely 3-3 this plant the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.960
 calera is located in chincha between 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.429
 mandarin and horse plantations 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.429
 that take advantage of the fields 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.109
 in a hangar the systems of bands 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.390
 Automated appeal to arms 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:33.159
 hydraulics achieving levels of 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.159
 unthinkable production 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.799
 the weighing system is also 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.569
 fundamental in the new processes of 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.490
 marketing of this consumer 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.189
 product so the new ones 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.649
 standards guarantee classification 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.319
 by size and weight in addition to the injection 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.740
 of ink that warns the limits in its 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.740
 consumption 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.179
 the human contribution is fundamental in this 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.700
 stage not in vain Peruvian technicians will 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.380
 will train in Holland for the management of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.640
 this technology 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.239
 We have permanent exports to 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.060
 japan to thailand to colombia to ecuador to 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.010
 venezuela and of course we're going to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 keep them and grow but our 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.480
 line but it's a very marginal thing and it's 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.660
 very small very marginal and very small 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.890
 then work over 99 by 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.510
 cent of our work is focused 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.790
 in growing voice consumption in the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.170
 Peru and bring good news of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 this wonderful product that we consume 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.519
 neither the first desire is so cheap 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.530
 It awaits us in the course of 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.860
 next year the capacity is doubled 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.459
 production reaching 5 million 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.459
 daily eggs 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.670
