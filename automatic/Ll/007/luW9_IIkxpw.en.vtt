type<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.520> material<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:31.300> guessing<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.320> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
type of material I'm guessing this is to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.900 
type of material I'm guessing this is to
ensure<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.800> if<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.190> actually<00:02:33.340> drop<00:02:33.760> the

ensure that if you actually drop the
tablet<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.170> edges<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:37.030> screen<00:02:37.330> wont<00:02:37.540> the

tablet on the edges the screen wont the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.950 
tablet on the edges the screen wont the
screen<00:02:38.440> won't<00:02:38.620> crack<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.340> yeah<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.570> design

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960
