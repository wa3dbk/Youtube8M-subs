00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.280
 I'm harry ice is 60 years coming 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.680
 things out again and I really wanted to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.039
 my whole life from now on home to the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 green or here and this is then one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.030
 purchased close to a 19 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.760
 96 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.980
 with 27,000 kilometers 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 and at the moment we're half past 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.790
 million 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.650
 and yes i do i actually do all 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.620
 cells of that car except welding 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.790
 points scénic out but 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.860
 well that is 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.570
 above expectations so far apk 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.100
 yes what then becomes all major 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.400
 all neatly kept and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.780
 I just have a part of fun in the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.170
 car belongs to me for everyday 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.170
 use 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.630
 I actually have nothing else 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.030
 attracted some attention 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.270
 school hungry need delivered 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.680
 well i think so 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.570
 the inspection of people falling it is one 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.780
 the soil is quite well welded 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 natural everywhere and technical he 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.930
 is well kept so I saw in the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.930
 no weird things 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.830
 i am building i have this panda that have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.480
 I bought together with a friend 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.440
 actually always 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.440
 have been busy this one 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 He had no time, I more so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.520
 mileage and so in failure anyway 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 already a nice car ready 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 let the camera expect that it is 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.159
 I did come up with points 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 Browse perhaps always a tradeoff 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.350
 what we are going to do then goes up 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.230
 on and dismantle is not just on is 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.560
 we already get one this way 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.560
 new life 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.200
 cracks in traded 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.320
 from outside it has bothered you 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.320
 was another 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.390
 nice 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.070
 the lock to take 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.379
 tires 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.379
 drain there 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.580
 crap makes sense 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.460
 good 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.170
 a real classic today so panda 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.790
 this is one of the last nineties 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 yet you are also more than 20 years old 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.280
 and more than three tons of faith is real 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.319
 an old container with a lot of experience 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.969
 we have just as going through the wringer 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 by our judge was not the only one 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.909
 We still have those here today 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.310
 a very characteristic car 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.280
 there he comes a very beautiful renault 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.040
 4 1986 on LPG 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.730
 more than 5 tons lied if we were curious 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.730
 find it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.759
 real power 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.180
 turbo not 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.390
 no, you do 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.710
 yes we have two very old cars see 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.630
 you judged today the one so thick 20 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.290
 this more than 25 years old now and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.290
 road tax free 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.100
 with a lot of experience so hennie 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.150
 I saw that you write down quite a bit 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.290
 I even got a ballpoint pen there 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.270
 written 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.120
 tell it but now you've seen 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.970
 for the one in people and for the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.820
 another a few points if we are alone 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.950
 look at the africa reject points 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.240
 well then we see that we urge renault 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.450
 actually only two disapproval dots 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.050
 and that is and who lagertje for 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.270
 and ball joint case and as expected 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.190
 fiat panda look then we have another 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.190
 number more than we have the battery that 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.140
 state was the exhaust directly the tire 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.880
 right for this below the minimum size 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.580
 for the profiling say below 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.300
 income 6 mm well corrosion to the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.400
 brake lines also an insured loop 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.130
 well and various plate parts are there 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.140
 actually so much rust on it but there 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.810
 again tectyl over it so that is 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.580
 actually requires a vein diagnosis in order to 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.970
 that exact assess to what extent one 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.080
 disapproval is precisely that there so hear it 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.610
 Panda seems a little on the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.890
 at the end of his latin she really needs it 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.600
 invest a lot of money 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.520
 well so you could n't quite do that 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.050
 say he can still be saved 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.460
 but it has to be done about oké 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.460
 thank you you're welcome 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.349
 well we have passed the inspection 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.190
 and yes well actually few are weird 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.960
 things and hand are coming and wheel bearing 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.659
 I had already heard myself since 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.360
 this week the summer tires are dream 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.620
 some parrying also makes more noise 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.870
 only the judge connie 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.970
 honor poets whether it is left-hand splits 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.190
 front or right for was my rivals 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.979
 wheel bearing which makes way too much noise 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.910
 the assure you see what a small one 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:40.070
 shed is such very small things 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.980
 further yes block is a bit nasty about the 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.510
 bottom and only 'tasty egg and the 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.830
 gearbox and that is because and 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.400
 but you really are 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.070
 Africa 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.280
 we can do it for now 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.490
 I think about it 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.740
 this car is with belongs to my who 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.150
 will stay with me again 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.490
 where are the exercise is we have 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.530
 plenty of space and 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.930
 Go to the garden and is corresponding 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.880
 with one with nature was always per 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.060
 ship and old are but he is not going 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.060
 more away 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.620
 home 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.140
 well the end judgment 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.120
 Some points have come up 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.330
 which I myself do not have 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.340
 had not seen yes it is now really from 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.390
 work on weighing points 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.960
 or 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:34.020
 or take it away anyway it's one 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.850
 difficult decision but we just have to 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.850
 really see how it goes
