00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello today I want to continue 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.320
 talk about leafy salads and the nearest 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.269
 A relative of the type cabbage arugula 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
 Please see the name of it 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.980
 enough 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.210
 this endo y and caterpillar and so on so 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 further there are a lot of all kinds 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.660
 titles but in particular we most often 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 know this name as arugula 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 please look not enough 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.710
 interesting leaf shape is enough 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 such a pleasant pungent flavor and nutty 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.350
 taste is also very healthy plant like 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.660
 You can judge if you watched a video about 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.180
 ordinary leaf lettuce is also very 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.789
 valuable and healthy nutrients 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 medicinal plant 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.510
 content of vitamins and macro and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.690
 trace it as it is huge 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 all sorts of vitamin a vitamin c eco 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.289
 vitamins a huge amount of group b 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.019
 this 6 would be 4 5 and so on and so forth 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:06.240
 further elements such as zinc 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.100
 manganese is high in iodine since 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.560
 we live with you not by the sea and middle 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.670
 the band is quite rare 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.460
 trace element 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 so here arugula is one of the leaders on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.130
 iodine content is very, very valuable 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.500
 zinc is just as strong and so 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.960
 further there is this wonderful 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.049
 nutritious and very vitamin A and plant 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.350
 and shown on of course as people 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.840
 high blood clots 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.670
 blood pressure of course people 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.369
 who monitor their health and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 trying to lose weight before 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.130
 as it is the finest source 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 energy that is, it increases the vital 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.290
 strength and actually speaking thanks 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 such a range of nutrients 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 it's a great source of vitamins and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.000
 calorie of course it is very and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.700
 very small per 100 grams of product 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.770
 only 26 kilocalories is very and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.950
 very little so that we can eat 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.330
 it in fairly large quantities and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.819
 no contraindications in principle this 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.709
 weed does not have also want to note 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.870
 the fact that he is arugula is like me and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.700
 said medicinal plant and 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.930
 can cure a large amount 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.870
 all kinds of diseases 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.390
 also worth considering what it is 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.830
 the finest valuable medicinal 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.360
 plants to people who suffer 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.180
 some do not grow uncai 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 insomnia diseases 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 are associated with kidney gout 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 in case of anemia with elevation and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.820
 The human immune system is also very 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.799
 favorably affects this plant 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.859
 also arugula is shown of course when 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.480
 all kinds of depression and all kinds of 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.829
 don't lie stage diseases also 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.870
 worth noting what about 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.239
 good to eat with anemia she 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.579
 removes extra harris cholesterol from 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.090
 the body because it is also 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.620
 a good source of iodine that is when 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.359
 thyroid diseases we also 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.970
 we can use it but here we need to be 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.380
 of course very carefully because there 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.380
 may be either a surplus or 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.690
 iodine deficiency also wants so much 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 note the wonderful anti-ulcer 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.280
 property of arugula to people suffering from it 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.769
 insidious enough unpleasant 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.269
 the disease must be included 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.989
 Lou's hand in your diet since she 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.510
 not only heals and reduces already 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.630
 existing wounds and thus is 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.769
 wonderful anti-inflammatory 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.660
 means and even if it turns out that way 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.120
 move away from the healing diet on allows 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
 avoid some kind of relapse that is it 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.110
 the property is also very helpful 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.670
 valuable well and in principle I want more 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.800
 say that arugula is 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.660
 wonderful wonderful aphrodisiac and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.410
 it is also very useful for men 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.780
 use this plant and so 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.520
 summing up what I have already said I will say 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.350
 about the fact that of course enough 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.270
 diverse range of good practices 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.750
 in more detail of course you can 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.240
 read on the site in the article but I want 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.130
 also say not useful 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.320
 Grass does not happen and it happens only because of 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.359
 whom you still know little about 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.870
 new meetings be healthy and on this 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.870
 bye everyone
