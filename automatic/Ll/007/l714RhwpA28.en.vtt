anyway with the torch you can flip it

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.589 
anyway with the torch you can flip it
round<00:05:17.880> like<00:05:19.310> there<00:05:20.310> we<00:05:20.370> go<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.120> now<00:05:21.150> I'm<00:05:21.360> gonna

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.200 

that's<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.200> end<00:05:46.320> of<00:05:46.410> this<00:05:46.530> level<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:48.060> then

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
that's the end of this level and then

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.700 
that's the end of this level and then
we've<00:05:48.390> got<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.540> nice<00:05:48.750> transition<00:05:49.140> into<00:05:49.560> the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
we've got a nice transition into the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.420 
we've got a nice transition into the
driving<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:54.440> I've<00:05:55.440> changed<00:05:55.770> this<00:05:55.980> gun<00:05:56.220> for

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
driving that I've changed this gun for

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.090 
driving that I've changed this gun for
an<00:05:56.550> Uzi<00:05:56.960> just<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.050> make<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.290> drive<00:05:58.500> runs<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.950> bit

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
an Uzi just to make the drive runs a bit

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:15.860 
an Uzi just to make the drive runs a bit
there<00:06:08.030> yes<00:06:09.030> they're<00:06:09.390> not<00:06:10.160> very<00:06:11.160> easy<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:14.870> shoot

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
there yes they're not very easy to shoot

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.310 
there yes they're not very easy to shoot
while<00:06:16.110> driving<00:06:16.410> but<00:06:17.040> at<00:06:17.760> least<00:06:17.880> you<00:06:18.090> can<00:06:18.270> do<00:06:19.170> it

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
while driving but at least you can do it

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:28.009 
while driving but at least you can do it
now

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.019 

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:30.779 

yeah<00:06:29.019> you<00:06:29.079> just<00:06:29.349> imagine<00:06:29.709> if<00:06:29.860> you<00:06:30.189> did<00:06:30.459> have<00:06:30.669> it

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
yeah you just imagine if you did have it

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.609 
yeah you just imagine if you did have it
was<00:06:31.089> really<00:06:31.569> good<00:06:31.809> which<00:06:31.959> we<00:06:32.169> look<00:06:32.379> to<00:06:32.559> the

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:32.619 
was really good which we look to the

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:37.109 
was really good which we look to the
Cylons<00:06:33.869> and<00:06:34.869> shoot<00:06:35.529> like<00:06:35.769> that<00:06:35.979> but<00:06:36.549> because

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:37.119 
Cylons and shoot like that but because

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:44.249 
Cylons and shoot like that but because
it<00:06:37.239> was<00:06:37.360> created<00:06:37.599> earlier<00:06:38.079> humping<00:06:38.499> is<00:06:43.259> not

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
it was created earlier humping is not

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:51.569 
it was created earlier humping is not
working<00:06:44.679> very<00:06:44.709> well<00:06:49.860> yeah<00:06:50.860> definitely<00:06:51.159> some
