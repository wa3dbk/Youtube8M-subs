it looks like all this has led up to the

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.419 
it looks like all this has led up to the
cancellation<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.170> silent<00:01:15.619> Hills<00:01:15.799> which<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.250> a

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
cancellation of silent Hills which is a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.069 
cancellation of silent Hills which is a
shame<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:17.000> don't<00:01:17.329> know<00:01:17.479> if<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.659> was<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:17.960> be

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
shame I don't know if it was going to be

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.709 
shame I don't know if it was going to be
a<00:01:18.109> PlayStation<00:01:18.770> 4<00:01:19.009> exclusive<00:01:19.039> I<00:01:19.880> don't<00:01:20.450> think

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
a PlayStation 4 exclusive I don't think

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:21.999 
a PlayStation 4 exclusive I don't think
it<00:01:20.840> was<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.079> think<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.590> might<00:01:21.770> have<00:01:21.829> been<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
it was I think it might have been a

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.760 
it was I think it might have been a
timed<00:01:22.340> exclusive<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.179> PlayStation<00:01:23.869> 4<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:24.740> I

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
timed exclusive on PlayStation 4 but I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.289 
timed exclusive on PlayStation 4 but I
think<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.189> game<00:01:25.399> was<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:25.969> eventually

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
think this game was going to eventually

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.319 
think this game was going to eventually
be<00:01:26.630> multi<00:01:27.079> plat<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.250> it's<00:01:28.549> been<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.789> long<00:01:29.060> time

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
be multi plat and it's been a long time

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.969 
be multi plat and it's been a long time
I<00:01:29.359> can't<00:01:29.810> even<00:01:29.899> remember<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.439> last<00:01:30.560> time<00:01:30.859> I

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
I can't even remember the last time I

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.800 
I can't even remember the last time I
played<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.310> demo<00:01:31.640> where<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.149> was<00:01:32.390> terrified

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
played a demo where I was terrified

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.800 
played a demo where I was terrified
where<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.890> setting<00:01:34.340> was<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.030> good<00:01:35.329> I<00:01:35.600> was

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
where the setting was just so good I was

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.010 
where the setting was just so good I was
immersed<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> game<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.609> terrified<00:01:38.299> so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
immersed in the game and terrified so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.539 
immersed in the game and terrified so
that's<00:01:39.200> why<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.439> kind<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.770> sucks<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.219> see<00:01:40.399> this
