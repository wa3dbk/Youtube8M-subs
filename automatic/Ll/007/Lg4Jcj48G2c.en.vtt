consider<00:00:09.450> Arcania<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> gothic<00:00:10.769> game

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
consider Arcania to be a gothic game

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.450 
consider Arcania to be a gothic game
despite<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> name<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.070> i'm<00:00:14.219> kind<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
despite the name on it and i'm kind of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.220 
despite the name on it and i'm kind of
glad<00:00:14.549> they<00:00:14.820> actually<00:00:15.120> dropped<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> gothic<00:00:15.990> 4

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
glad they actually dropped the gothic 4

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.720 
glad they actually dropped the gothic 4
name<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.430> would<00:00:17.550> just

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
name on here because then it would just

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.420 
name on here because then it would just
not<00:00:18.180> only<00:00:18.270> ridiculous<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
not only ridiculous but it's not a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.250 
not only ridiculous but it's not a
gothic<00:00:20.880> game<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.720> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> helps<00:00:22.109> out

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
gothic game so that kind of helps out

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
gothic game so that kind of helps out
but<00:00:22.859> I'll<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.100> an<00:00:23.220> annotation<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
but I'll have an annotation to where you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.710 
but I'll have an annotation to where you
can<00:00:24.560> watch<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.769> Arcania<00:00:26.310> review<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.330> if

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
can watch my Arcania review because if

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.000 
can watch my Arcania review because if
you<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.349> watch<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.890> you'll

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you don't watch that then you'll

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
you don't watch that then you'll
probably<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.699> confused<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.869> on

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
probably be confused a little bit on

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.450 
probably be confused a little bit on
some<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> stuff<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.800> talked<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
some of the stuff I talked about in this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.170 
some of the stuff I talked about in this
because<00:00:34.010> I'm<00:00:35.010> gonna<00:00:35.160> gloss<00:00:35.460> over<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
because I'm gonna gloss over a lot of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
because I'm gonna gloss over a lot of
the<00:00:36.390> stuff<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:36.989> talked<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> already

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the stuff that I've talked to already

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
the stuff that I've talked to already
talked<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.730> Arcana<00:00:39.059> review<00:00:39.559> but

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
talked about in the Arcana review but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
talked about in the Arcana review but
this<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> development<00:00:41.969> hell<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.450> quite<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this was in development hell for quite a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.190 
this was in development hell for quite a
while<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.270> delayed

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
while actually it was delayed

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100 
while actually it was delayed
indefinitely<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:47.370> March<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.850> 2011<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.020> was

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
indefinitely in March of 2011 and it was

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.340 
indefinitely in March of 2011 and it was
finally<00:00:49.829> released<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.430> October<00:00:50.969> 25th<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.750> 2011

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
finally released on October 25th of 2011

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
finally released on October 25th of 2011
so<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> full<00:00:53.820> year<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> few

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so that was about a full year and a few

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
so that was about a full year and a few
days<00:00:54.840> after<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.860> original<00:00:56.129> Arcania<00:00:56.789> was

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
days after the original Arcania was

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
days after the original Arcania was
released<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:58.020> quite<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> while<00:00:58.710> coming

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
released it's been quite a while coming

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.639 
released it's been quite a while coming
and<00:00:59.309> what<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.170> standalone

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and what we got was the standalone

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.139 
and what we got was the standalone
expansion<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.340> doesn't<00:01:02.670> require<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
expansion it doesn't require the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.710 
expansion it doesn't require the
original<00:01:03.539> game<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> play<00:01:04.460> which<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.489> nice<00:01:05.850> but

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
original game to play which is nice but

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
original game to play which is nice but
the<00:01:07.380> question<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.010> did<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.700> improve<00:01:09.240> upon

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the question is did it improve upon

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.590 
the question is did it improve upon
anything<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.530> its<00:01:10.830> predecessor<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> base

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
anything from its predecessor the base

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
anything from its predecessor the base
Arcania<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:15.390> forsaken

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Arcania or was it just like forsaken

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
Arcania or was it just like forsaken
gods<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.830> two<00:01:17.070> Gothic<00:01:17.400> 3<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.030> really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
gods was two Gothic 3 and a really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
gods was two Gothic 3 and a really
crappy<00:01:18.720> expansion<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.460> point<00:01:20.729> in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
crappy expansion I see a little point in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
crappy expansion I see a little point in
talking<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.299> about<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.630> presentation

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
talking much about the presentation

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.660 
talking much about the presentation
because<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.619> pretty<00:01:22.799> much<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> exactly<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because it's pretty much the exactly the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.990 
because it's pretty much the exactly the
same<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> base<00:01:24.780> Arcania<00:01:26.000> it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
same as it was in the base Arcania it's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.170 
same as it was in the base Arcania it's
still<00:01:27.240> very<00:01:27.680> uninspired<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.040> still<00:01:29.340> visually

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
still very uninspired but still visually

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
still very uninspired but still visually
appealing<00:01:31.070> environments<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> terms<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
appealing environments in terms of the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
appealing environments in terms of the
lush<00:01:33.299> greenery<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.619> once<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.189> into

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
lush greenery but once you get into

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
lush greenery but once you get into
Satar<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.509> self<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.619> bunch<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
Satar if it's self it's just a bunch of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
Satar if it's self it's just a bunch of
ruins<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> dungeon<00:01:39.240> e'en<00:01:39.479> dier<00:01:39.509> mattes<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
ruins and dungeon e'en dier mattes and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
ruins and dungeon e'en dier mattes and
it<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.439> really<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.400> appealing<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:41.850> all

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it just really is not appealing at all

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.240 
it just really is not appealing at all
even<00:01:42.810> though<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.110> same<00:01:43.320> high<00:01:43.710> quality

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
even though it is the same high quality

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
even though it is the same high quality
that<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.759> graphics<00:01:45.180> were<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.600> base<00:01:46.409> Arcania

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that the graphics were in base Arcania

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
that the graphics were in base Arcania
with<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> same<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.270> visual<00:01:48.570> touches

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
with all the same little visual touches

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.080 
with all the same little visual touches
here<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.079> there<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> such<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.820> an

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here and there and such it's just not an

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
here and there and such it's just not an
appealing<00:01:51.450> game<00:01:52.310> because<00:01:53.310> most<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
appealing game because most of it is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
appealing game because most of it is
spent<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.390> dungeons<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> ruins<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
spent in dungeons and in the ruins of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.480 
spent in dungeons and in the ruins of
satara<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.409> kind<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> bored<00:01:59.219> with

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
satara so you're just kind of bored with

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.429 
satara so you're just kind of bored with
it<00:01:59.520> after<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> while<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it after a while because it's just

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
it after a while because it's just
literally<00:02:01.829> brown<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.430> gray<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> sometimes

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
literally brown and gray and sometimes

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.069 
literally brown and gray and sometimes
some<00:02:03.600> red<00:02:03.869> thrown<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.850> for<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.390> lava<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> such

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
some red thrown in for the lava and such

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
some red thrown in for the lava and such
said<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.030> impressive

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
said it's not all that impressive

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.770 
said it's not all that impressive
visually

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
visually

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.600 
visually
sounds<00:02:11.410> pretty<00:02:11.560> much<00:02:11.770> exactly<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.280> same<00:02:12.490> as

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
sounds pretty much exactly the same as

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.970 
sounds pretty much exactly the same as
it<00:02:12.700> was<00:02:12.880> in<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.780> base<00:02:13.960> Arcania<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.680> I'm<00:02:14.830> not

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
it was in the base Arcania so I'm not

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.260 
it was in the base Arcania so I'm not
gonna<00:02:15.130> say<00:02:15.370> much<00:02:15.550> about<00:02:15.670> that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
gonna say much about that

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.110 
gonna say much about that
so<00:02:16.780> overall<00:02:17.500> presentation<00:02:18.010> pretty<00:02:18.790> much<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
so overall presentation pretty much the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.210 
so overall presentation pretty much the
same<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.780> still<00:02:20.320> got<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> lot<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> same

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
same it still got a lot of the same

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.980 
same it still got a lot of the same
problems<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.940> particular<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> lot<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> same

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
problems in particular a lot of the same

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.040 
problems in particular a lot of the same
glitches<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.430> sound<00:02:24.730> bug<00:02:25.090> from<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
glitches like the sound bug from the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.360 
glitches like the sound bug from the
original<00:02:26.350> Arcania<00:02:26.620> where<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.100> cut

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
original Arcania where it would just cut

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.550 
original Arcania where it would just cut
out<00:02:27.490> randomly<00:02:27.940> still<00:02:28.750> there<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.320> know

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
out randomly still there I don't know

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.800 
out randomly still there I don't know
why<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.010> happens<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:31.210> it's<00:02:31.390> still<00:02:31.600> there

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
why it happens but it's still there

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.460 
why it happens but it's still there
that's<00:02:31.990> annoying

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
that's annoying

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's annoying
you<00:02:32.860> still<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> lot<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.460> visual<00:02:33.700> hang-ups

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.230 
you still have a lot of visual hang-ups
and<00:02:34.360> such<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.990> kind<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.760> irritating<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.940> deal

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
and such it's kind of irritating to deal

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.430 
and such it's kind of irritating to deal
with<00:02:37.390> all<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.660> stuff<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.050> they<00:02:38.200> never

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
too easy it had a really cool crafting

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.120 
too easy it had a really cool crafting
system<00:04:13.750> actually<00:04:14.290> in<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.739> could<00:04:14.860> craft

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
system actually in that you could craft

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.650

a<00:04:15.280> lot<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.610> really<00:04:15.820> cool<00:04:15.970> items<00:04:16.230> but<00:04:18.150> they<00:04:19.150> were

a lot of really cool items but they were

a lot of really cool items but they were
kind<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.080> overpowered<00:04:20.770> in<00:04:20.890> some<00:04:21.130> ways<00:04:21.340> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
kind of overpowered in some ways and

kind of overpowered in some ways and

were impractical to make on a lap very
rudimentary<00:04:27.030> system<00:04:27.690> but<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.139> still<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:28.530> kind

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
rudimentary system but it still was kind

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.540 
rudimentary system but it still was kind
of<00:04:28.740> cool

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
of cool

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.240 
of cool
they<00:04:30.060> brought<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.480> back<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.960> false<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.950> tariff

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
they brought that back in false a tariff

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.460 
they brought that back in false a tariff
of<00:04:32.340> course<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.850> still<00:04:33.090> plays<00:04:33.690> fairly

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
of course it still plays fairly

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.270 
of course it still plays fairly

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
if you started off as a new character

and all that and you have this maxed out
stats<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.080> everything<00:06:07.410> so<00:06:07.620> you're<00:06:07.740> just<00:06:07.860> a

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039
