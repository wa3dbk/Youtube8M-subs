the option make sure to watch us in high
quality<00:00:40.510> it's<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:40.989> much<00:00:41.170> better<00:00:41.350> than<00:00:42.070> low

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
quality it's so much better than low

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.360 
quality it's so much better than low
quality<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.120> look<00:00:43.330> all<00:00:43.510> grainy<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:44.370> pixelated

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
quality I look all grainy and pixelated

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.439 
quality I look all grainy and pixelated
and<00:00:45.699> weird<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:47.320> that<00:00:47.440> if<00:00:47.589> you<00:00:47.680> guys<00:00:47.829> can

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
and weird so do that if you guys can

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.189 
and weird so do that if you guys can
definitely<00:00:49.449> makes<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> quality<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.110> the

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
definitely makes the quality of the

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.579 
definitely makes the quality of the
video<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.470> lot<00:00:50.829> better<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.809> am<00:00:53.230> going<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.440> go

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
video a lot better so I am going to go

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.979 
video a lot better so I am going to go
ahead<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.920> switch<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.519> my<00:00:55.089> other<00:00:55.329> view<00:00:55.659> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
ahead and switch to my other view the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.119 
ahead and switch to my other view the
one<00:00:56.110> I'm<00:00:56.199> using<00:00:56.230> all<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.589> time<00:00:56.739> now<00:00:56.920> we're<00:00:57.070> you

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
one I'm using all the time now we're you

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.799 
one I'm using all the time now we're you
can<00:00:57.250> see<00:00:57.489> my<00:00:57.610> hands<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.119> you<00:00:58.600> know<00:00:58.690> it's

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
can see my hands and you know it's

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.840 
can see my hands and you know it's
really<00:00:59.049> bad<00:00:59.260> because<00:00:59.830> my<00:01:00.129> iphone<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:00.640> way<00:01:00.790> too

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
really bad because my iphone is way too

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.100 
really bad because my iphone is way too
far<00:01:01.150> away<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.570> can't<00:01:01.750> really<00:01:01.839> tell

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
far away and you can't really tell

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.200 
far away and you can't really tell
because<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.530> not<00:01:02.680> focused<00:01:03.070> in<00:01:03.250> yeah<00:01:03.970> that

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
because it's not focused in yeah that

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.960 
because it's not focused in yeah that
view<00:01:04.479> so<00:01:05.369> hopefully<00:01:06.369> works<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:06.670> little<00:01:06.790> bit

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
view so hopefully works a little bit

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.219 
view so hopefully works a little bit
better<00:01:07.119> this<00:01:07.270> time<00:01:07.330> alright<00:01:07.750> guys<00:01:07.930> so

better this time alright guys so
switching<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:09.729> hedging<00:01:10.000> run<00:01:10.210> through<00:01:10.390> all<00:01:10.420> my

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
switching so hedging run through all my

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.510 
switching so hedging run through all my
applications<00:01:10.750> like<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.650> said<00:01:11.920> stated<00:01:12.430> before

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
applications like I said stated before

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.090 
applications like I said stated before
and<00:01:12.939> just<00:01:13.750> ones<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.080> use<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.350> an<00:01:14.439> everyday<00:01:14.619> basis

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
and just ones I use on an everyday basis

help you guys out and maybe buying some

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.980 
help you guys out and maybe buying some
applications<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.360> don't<00:01:19.540> have<00:01:19.720> yet

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
applications that you don't have yet

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.679 
applications that you don't have yet
they<00:01:20.650> can<00:01:20.830> sum<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:21.040> because<00:01:21.700> there<00:01:22.390> are<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.540> lot

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
they can sum up because there are a lot

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.390 
they can sum up because there are a lot
of<00:01:22.720> good<00:01:22.900> things<00:01:23.080> for<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.619> iphone<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.220> I

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
know with so many applications it's hard

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.190 
know with so many applications it's hard
it's<00:01:26.290> easy<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.560> be<00:01:26.619> confused<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.720> get<00:01:28.990> all

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
any signal using edge or 3g um it's

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.010 
any signal using edge or 3g um it's
pretty<00:02:09.700> slow<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.119> edge<00:02:10.300> though<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.720> i<00:02:10.750> would

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
pretty slow with edge though so i would

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.809 
pretty slow with edge though so i would
recommend<00:02:11.440> 3g<00:02:11.770> usually<00:02:12.130> will<00:02:12.459> boot<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.790> off

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819

if<00:02:13.209> you're<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.450> edge<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.530> nice<00:02:14.770> because

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
if you're on edge but it's nice because

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440 
if you're on edge but it's nice because
you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.190> connect<00:02:15.610> without<00:02:15.700> having<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.120> Wi-Fi
