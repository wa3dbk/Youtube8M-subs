00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 who never dreamed of having a Mercedes in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.770
 your garage because it is the motorization today 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.350
 will test a car that in the 90s was 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 a failure in brazil that same class 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 But if you still have memories 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 of that old car 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
 forget it because today we are going to walk 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.160
 in the real class 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.269
 the new bet of mercedes and others 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.619
 henrique oliveira to test with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 people and henrique 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.590
 the new class a is really a mercedes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 is a mercedes is the new car at the door of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.809
 mercedes is not the expectation of mercedes 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.899
 Brazil is that for every two buyers 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 of a brand car is a buyer 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.980
 then the class is a car 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 brand new 1.6 turbo engine 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.530
 double clutch gearbox and seven 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.199
 speeds of 156 horsepower and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 with a sweeping look I think the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.030
 thing that draws more attention in the car. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.010
 very visual visual and I think 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 that has everything to conquer the market 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 mercedes has strategically placed the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 car in its entry version to 99 thousand 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.820
 below the psychological barrier of the hundred 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.159
 thousand and one car varies between 99 and 109 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.259
 no 109 thousand in the most complete version 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.360
 and I think you have everything to master the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.420
 market and fight on an equal footing with 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 Series 1 of BMW and own a 1 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.689
 I heard it's a car, it's going to come out a bit. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.340
 has a similar price and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 practically the same proposal of this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
 mercedes car until you reach the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 I have already had the opportunity to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.180
 the car and henrique oliveira is still going 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 I drove it now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.259
 Well I can already say that I would adapt 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.149
 very easily is it a car that the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.240
 expectation is very good because the car 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.390
 offers what he promises and oppresses 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 promises fuel economy engine 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.920
 already in one is already following the trend 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200
 of the mobilizes of giving a website in a motor 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 of 150cc turbo horse 1.6 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.159
 so I think it has everything to please 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 besides the visual also the pleasure of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.860
 to drive 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.780
 So let's go for a ride. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.940
 henrique would drive at will we will test 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.160
 enough and we start the motorization 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.620
 in high style henrique 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 the car is all yours 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:28.049
 to expand the idea in the emerging market 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.879
 of Mercedes is basically the same as 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.290
 other automakers trying to win 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.450
 space in Brazil 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.639
 the class is a premium product more 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.719
 ideal for finding new customers in this 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.819
 profile with prices between 99 110 thousand reais 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.370
 mercedes bet is the same as it had 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.709
 in the 90's when he invested his chips 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.769
 in the other version of class a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.939
 The difference is that this time the car is 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.939
 really attractive 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.240
 two versions are available for the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.010
 model that can still raise the price 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.760
 depending on some accessories 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.800
 the two come with seven air bags as standard 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.780
 driver fatigue detector brakes at 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.850
 that help the driver in situations 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.430
 high risk while keeping the car unstable 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.440
 start stop system and economy of 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.910
 assistant fuel for the climb 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.610
 among others 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.800
 here we are today the top line and should 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.570
 leverage the sales of the automaker 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.420
 she has the front grille chrome wheels 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.120
 17-inch bi-xenon headlights with 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.550
 LED and daytime running lights dual exhaust 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.860
 multifunction steering wheel leather finishing 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.000
 also in leather shell banks 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.000
 among others 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.050
 not many kilometers were 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.629
 long only about ten minutes 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.489
 but it was enough to see the smile on 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.390
 This is how Henrique made the first 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.790
 curve 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.000
 To already know that you liked the car. 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.819
 there are cars that can invest the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.820
 driver then this is one of them is the type 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.700
 of the car you sit regulates the seat 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.820
 adjusts the steering wheel in ideal opposition 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.650
 to drive and feel right at home the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.450
 car gives you a feeling of 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.080
 security and stability 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.290
 And this car here is one of those then. 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.229
 Who likes to drive this car? 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.979
 his behavior and is exactly what 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.360
 the visual suggests a car that despite 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.360
 to be the cheapest car in mercedes is a 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.130
 car that translates sportsmanship 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.450
 stability and performance. 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.840
 dual clutch gears and seven 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.220
 although it is not very smooth 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.630
 works great you have the option of 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.790
 manual exchanges 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.250
 in the sport he switches with a higher turn 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.990
 or the echo that you exchange with interest more 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.880
 lowing the economy and greater 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.760
 softness you have all these options of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.770
 but it's a car that gives 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.600
 pleasure to drive I think this is the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.000
 main feature of the car besides 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.830
 everything is an extremely beautiful car and 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.250
 not only on the outside but inside the people 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.520
 seated here is the quality of the 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.220
 material used at the steering 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.539
 it's in the doors the finish is something else 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.669
 stand out and henrique 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.830
 sure the internal look of the car is 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.350
 very cool is a car that has 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.090
 sobriety of Germans with touches of 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.100
 modernity then you have the whole 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.220
 tradition of a mercedes but with 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.950
 aluminum finishes with 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.080
 display and you have a very 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.930
 beautiful all the modern features that 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.680
 Do you have cars on the finish today? 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.700
 of the seats the leather panel material is 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.039
 to stand out 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.320
 It's a car that looks pretty much 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.020
 on the outside and inside the henrique is 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.419
 this is a car that varies between 99 thousand 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.930
 real 110 thousand reais 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.780
 the fight in this segment can face 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.690
 I think so, I think it's a car. 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.270
 which is a no we can not say that the 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.610
 Brazil's level is whether a cheap car is 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.949
 a car a little expensive but I think 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.620
 worth every penny he has a price 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.169
 competitive silver fighting there as the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.560
 We've already spoken with an audi and van and with 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.870
 bmw 1 series so it's a car for 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.039
 Who's thinking about spending 100 thousand reais? 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.710
 to buy a car 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.389
 seriously think about this mercedes class 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.729
 What did you like best? 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.979
 Pleasure to drive for sure I think 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.169
 which is the strong point of the car a visual 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.090
 What a pleasure to drive, I'll keep the 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.130
 visual and finish I think it's a car 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.830
 The car is very well finished 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.030
 detail you can hardly find 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.740
 in other versions 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.460
 but there are always henrique also something that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.440
 You do not like to think the worst has 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.789
 something to highlight that is not 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.680
 so positive 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.539
 I think the only snag despite the good 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.370
 it is a box that 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.590
 responds intelligently to the 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.090
 but I think he's on time. 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.159
 You're mostly with a 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.919
 shift higher gear shift one 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.720
 bit rough is not very soft I guess 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.659
 that the only snag of the car 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.330
 to finish a grade I would give 9 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:21.889
 car I fucking liked it 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.780
 the henrique also in the next program 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:27.940
 will have a surprise for you always 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.940
 good cars for us to be still good
