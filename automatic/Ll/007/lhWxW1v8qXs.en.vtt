00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this map is actually a smaller map than

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
this map is actually a smaller map than
the<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.140> map<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.890> other<00:00:53.039> map<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> moon

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the other map the other map was a moon

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
the other map the other map was a moon
map<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.219> totally<00:00:56.219> different

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
map which was actually totally different

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.170 
map which was actually totally different
from<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.750> style<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:59.640> guess<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.120> say

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
from this style of I guess you would say

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
from this style of I guess you would say
gameplay<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.800> didn't<00:01:02.190> have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
gameplay because this didn't have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
gameplay because this didn't have
vehicles<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> don't<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.329> vehicles<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
vehicles you don't have vehicles in this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.880 
vehicles you don't have vehicles in this
map<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> other<00:01:06.210> map<00:01:06.510> did<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.320> vehicles

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
map but the other map did have vehicles

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
map but the other map did have vehicles
and<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> also<00:01:08.490> had<00:01:08.729> turrets<00:01:09.560> but<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> lot

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and it also had turrets but it was a lot

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
and it also had turrets but it was a lot
bigger<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> he<00:01:12.479> had<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.780> speeder<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
bigger and he had your speeder so you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
bigger and he had your speeder so you
could<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> map

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
okay your class you you have basically a

actually to the game so you have to look
at<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> other

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
at it like that because if the other

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
at it like that because if the other
player<00:01:52.020> has<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.409> shotgun<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.759> very

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
of people didn't realize that and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
of people didn't realize that and
there's<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.909> bad<00:02:05.930> feedback

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
there's a lot of you know bad feedback

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
there's a lot of you know bad feedback
on<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> game<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.250> honest<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.789> game

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
on this game but to be honest this game

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
on this game but to be honest this game
is<00:02:09.300> beautiful<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.319> runs<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:11.970> good

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
is beautiful it runs pretty good

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.429 
is beautiful it runs pretty good
i'd<00:02:13.079> say<00:02:13.379> like<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.939> control<00:02:15.439> sensitivity

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
i'd say like the control sensitivity

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.199 
i'd say like the control sensitivity
probably<00:02:16.920> needs<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.159> be<00:02:17.280> adjusted<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.000> worked

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
probably needs to be adjusted and worked

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.759 
probably needs to be adjusted and worked
on<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.870> probably<00:02:19.019> because<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.590> just

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
on and that's probably because it's just

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.589 
on and that's probably because it's just
an<00:02:19.890> alpha<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.849> they<00:02:20.970> definitely<00:02:21.180> need<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
an alpha but they definitely need to

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.809 
an alpha but they definitely need to
work<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.849> l<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.120> add<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.689> l1<00:02:25.170> r1<00:02:25.500> l2<00:02:26.040> r<00:02:26.549> to

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
work on that l to add the l1 r1 l2 r to

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.839 
work on that l to add the l1 r1 l2 r to
swap<00:02:27.500> option<00:02:28.500> hopefully<00:02:29.189> they'll<00:02:29.400> add<00:02:29.579> that

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
swap option hopefully they'll add that

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.970 
swap option hopefully they'll add that
for<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> beta<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.079> then<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.379> way<00:02:31.530> i<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.650> play

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
for the beta so then that way i can play

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.809 
for the beta so then that way i can play
this<00:02:32.129> game<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.400> lot<00:02:32.760> longer<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.859> longer

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
this game a lot longer just a longer

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.699 
this game a lot longer just a longer
period<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.359> time<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:36.930> i<00:02:37.109> was<00:02:37.319> playing<00:02:37.560> for

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
period of time because i was playing for

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.589 
period of time because i was playing for
like<00:02:37.829> maybe<00:02:38.250> three<00:02:38.579> or<00:02:38.609> four<00:02:38.819> hours<00:02:39.180> my<00:02:39.359> hand

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
like maybe three or four hours my hand

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.690 
like maybe three or four hours my hand
would<00:02:39.689> get<00:02:39.840> really<00:02:39.959> sore<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.430> kind<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
would get really sore and it's kind of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.309 
would get really sore and it's kind of
difficult<00:02:41.879> for<00:02:42.239> me<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.569> jump<00:02:42.870> around<00:02:43.200> a

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
difficult for me to like jump around a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.750 
difficult for me to like jump around a
lot<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.220> understand<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
lot because you have to understand the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.839 
lot because you have to understand the
jump<00:02:45.090> capability<00:02:46.099> with<00:02:47.099> your<00:02:47.340> character

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
jump capability with your character

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.140 
jump capability with your character
basically<00:02:48.180> double<00:02:49.049> tap<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:50.040> X<00:02:50.220> button<00:02:50.370> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
basically double tap the X button that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.509 
basically double tap the X button that
just<00:02:51.389> basically<00:02:51.690> levitates<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.069> then

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
just basically levitates you up and then

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.759 
just basically levitates you up and then
you<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.879> hit<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.150> again<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.409> drop

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you just hit it again and you just drop

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.000 
you just hit it again and you just drop
which<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.340> pretty<00:02:56.519> cool<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.209> pretty<00:02:57.450> sick

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
which is pretty cool it's a pretty sick

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.149 
which is pretty cool it's a pretty sick
idea<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.639> the<00:03:00.000> whole<00:03:00.239> jump<00:03:00.930> idea<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.040> was

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
idea for the whole jump idea and I was

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.000 
idea for the whole jump idea and I was
just<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.540> actually<00:03:04.010> really

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
just I kind of like it I actually really

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.390 
just I kind of like it I actually really
like<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.629> so<00:03:06.629> your<00:03:07.349> weapons<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.459> do

weapons in multiplayer and here's why I
say<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.219> because<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.909> played<00:04:24.719> the<00:04:24.900> campaign

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110

certain item things every week well
these<00:05:00.990> things<00:05:01.319> were<00:05:01.590> actually<00:05:02.159> giving<00:05:02.879> you

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
these things were actually giving you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.119 
these things were actually giving you
better<00:05:03.389> weapons<00:05:04.050> when<00:05:04.349> you<00:05:04.440> went<00:05:04.650> back<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
better weapons when you went back to the

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.369 
better weapons when you went back to the
tower<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.789> you<00:05:05.879> would<00:05:06.090> get<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.270> stronger<00:05:06.780> weapon

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
tower so you would get a stronger weapon

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.890 
tower so you would get a stronger weapon
so<00:05:07.889> when<00:05:08.069> I<00:05:08.099> went<00:05:08.520> back<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:09.060> would<00:05:09.240> have<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.479> much

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
so when I went back I would have a much

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.110 
so when I went back I would have a much
powerful<00:05:10.469> weapon<00:05:11.009> so<00:05:11.250> i<00:05:11.280> think<00:05:11.430> i<00:05:11.729> went<00:05:11.909> up<00:05:12.060> to

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
powerful weapon so i think i went up to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.920 
powerful weapon so i think i went up to
like<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:13.139> damage<00:05:13.440> was<00:05:13.800> like<00:05:14.009> 75<00:05:14.819> or<00:05:15.389> 80<00:05:15.659> or

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.499 
like the damage was like 75 or 80 or
something<00:05:16.379> that's<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.770> highest<00:05:16.949> i<00:05:17.279> got<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:17.879> if

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
what I really wanted to know because if

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.100 
what I really wanted to know because if
that's<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.699> case<00:05:29.969> then<00:05:30.029> that's<00:05:30.569> actually

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
that's the case then that's actually

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170 
that's the case then that's actually
true<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.560> actually<00:05:31.949> get<00:05:32.159> stronger<00:05:32.669> weapons

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
true you actually get stronger weapons

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.939 
true you actually get stronger weapons
just<00:05:33.360> by<00:05:33.539> playing<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.020> multiplayer<00:05:34.469> side<00:05:34.770> so

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
just by playing the multiplayer side so

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.100 
just by playing the multiplayer side so
you<00:05:35.009> don't<00:05:35.250> necessarily<00:05:35.430> have<00:05:35.909> to<00:05:36.060> play<00:05:36.509> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
you don't necessarily have to play the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.119 
you don't necessarily have to play the
campaign<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:38.520> get<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.819> better<00:05:39.000> weapons<00:05:40.129> you

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
campaign to get the better weapons you

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.119 
campaign to get the better weapons you
see<00:05:41.339> the<00:05:41.460> balance<00:05:41.879> there<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:43.560> only<00:05:43.860> major

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
see the balance there the only major

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.790 
see the balance there the only major
issue<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.759> have<00:05:45.150> is<00:05:45.449> the<00:05:46.050> vehicles<00:05:46.529> and<00:05:46.740> the

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
issue I have is the vehicles and the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.579 
issue I have is the vehicles and the
turrets<00:05:47.190> hopefully<00:05:47.759> they<00:05:47.909> do<00:05:48.020> fix<00:05:49.020> those<00:05:49.349> and

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 
turrets hopefully they do fix those and

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.999 
turrets hopefully they do fix those and
adjust<00:05:50.039> them<00:05:50.219> so<00:05:50.580> they're<00:05:51.419> just<00:05:51.690> difficult<00:05:52.560> to

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
adjust them so they're just difficult to

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.950 
adjust them so they're just difficult to
use<00:05:53.870> that's<00:05:54.870> basically<00:05:55.529> all<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:56.069> hope<00:05:56.759> I<00:05:57.539> just

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
use that's basically all I hope I just

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.980 
use that's basically all I hope I just
like<00:05:58.169> fighting<00:05:58.860> people<00:05:59.610> head<00:06:00.360> on<00:06:00.569> you<00:06:00.810> know

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
like fighting people head on you know

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.499 
like fighting people head on you know
like<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:02.219> know<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:02.969> hopefully<00:06:03.389> they

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
like that you know so hopefully they

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.740 
like that you know so hopefully they
make<00:06:03.750> more<00:06:04.050> maps<00:06:04.289> like<00:06:04.620> this<00:06:05.089> definitely<00:06:06.089> they

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
make more maps like this definitely they

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.420 
make more maps like this definitely they
make<00:06:06.930> more<00:06:07.199> maps<00:06:07.409> like<00:06:07.680> this<00:06:07.889> that<00:06:08.190> would<00:06:08.339> be

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
make more maps like this that would be

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.980 
make more maps like this that would be
awesome<00:06:08.580> because<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.210> map<00:06:09.449> did<00:06:09.659> not<00:06:09.810> have

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
awesome because this map did not have

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.360 
awesome because this map did not have
vehicles<00:06:10.409> so<00:06:10.560> I'm<00:06:10.620> wondering<00:06:10.830> if<00:06:11.159> it<00:06:11.250> was<00:06:11.310> a

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
vehicles so I'm wondering if it was a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.209 
vehicles so I'm wondering if it was a
test<00:06:11.520> run<00:06:12.029> to<00:06:12.240> see<00:06:12.270> if<00:06:12.659> people<00:06:13.589> prefer<00:06:13.979> the

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
test run to see if people prefer the

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.610 
test run to see if people prefer the
smaller<00:06:14.520> maps<00:06:14.909> of<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.360> bigger<00:06:15.599> maps<00:06:15.900> or<00:06:16.169> they

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
smaller maps of the bigger maps or they

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.170 
smaller maps of the bigger maps or they
give<00:06:16.800> just<00:06:17.009> going<00:06:17.159> to<00:06:17.219> have<00:06:17.370> a<00:06:17.400> variety

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
give just going to have a variety

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.360 
give just going to have a variety
overall<00:06:18.839> because<00:06:19.560> they<00:06:19.830> could<00:06:19.979> just<00:06:20.009> take

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
overall because they could just take

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.980 
overall because they could just take
shit<00:06:20.669> out<00:06:20.849> and<00:06:21.120> be<00:06:21.360> like<00:06:21.539> all<00:06:21.839> right<00:06:21.870> well
