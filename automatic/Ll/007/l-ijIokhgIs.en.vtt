00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
released one before but this will be the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
released one before but this will be the
zoom<00:00:11.070> load<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.730> pc<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:13.309> it's<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.610> not

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
zoom load for pc and it's really not

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
zoom load for pc and it's really not
that<00:00:14.940> hard<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.809> pretty<00:00:16.470> straightforward

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
that hard it's pretty straightforward

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.750 
that hard it's pretty straightforward
and<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.240> out<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.420> time<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.750> basically

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
and it's just out of time and basically

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.349 
and it's just out of time and basically
now<00:00:21.560> you<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.710> need<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.949> xbox<00:00:23.460> reload<00:00:23.880> config

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

reload see if you use reload everyone
must<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.950> in<00:00:37.950> cameron<00:00:38.399> has

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
must know really because in cameron has

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
must know really because in cameron has
it<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.079> anyways<00:00:40.079> getting<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.680> really

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it but anyways getting so it's really

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.690 
it but anyways getting so it's really
not<00:00:41.160> hard<00:00:42.680> basically<00:00:43.680> depending<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
not hard basically depending on the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.660 
not hard basically depending on the
keyboard<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.950> might<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
keyboard you have it might take you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
keyboard you have it might take you
longer<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:49.140> used<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> zoom<00:00:49.800> load

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
longer to get used to the zoom load

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
longer to get used to the zoom load
because<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.930> keyboard<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because i had this keyboard and the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.170 
because i had this keyboard and the
first<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.180> tried<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> worked<00:00:55.039> but<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
first time I tried it worked but when a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
first time I tried it worked but when a
great<00:00:57.510> broke<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.230> new<00:00:58.410> keyboard

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
great broke and then I got new keyboard

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
great broke and then I got new keyboard
we<00:00:59.039> couldn't<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.670> took<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.390> long

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
we couldn't we just took me a very long

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
we couldn't we just took me a very long
time<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.260> used<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> timing<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.250> don't

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
time to get used to the timing I don't

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.420 
time to get used to the timing I don't
know<00:01:03.000> why<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
know why but you know it could if you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.399 
know why but you know it could if you
can't<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> hang<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:07.020> give<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can't get the hang of it don't give up

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
can't get the hang of it don't give up
because<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.100> probably<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> your

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
because it's probably because of your

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
because it's probably because of your
keyboard<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.020> timing<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.590> you'll<00:01:11.520> get

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
keyboard not your timing so you'll get

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.649 
keyboard not your timing so you'll get
used<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.409> well<00:01:13.409> anyway<00:01:14.030> here<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.060> there

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
used to it well anyway here goes there

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
used to it well anyway here goes there
are<00:01:15.750> many<00:01:15.900> ways<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.430> going

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
are many ways about you know going going

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
are many ways about you know going going
about<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.450> zoom<00:01:18.600> load<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.170> tried

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
about doing a zoom load but I tried

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.410 
about doing a zoom load but I tried
every<00:01:20.100> single<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
every single way and I think this is the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.580 
every single way and I think this is the
easiest<00:01:22.430> right<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> do

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
easiest right so what you're going to do

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.170 
easiest right so what you're going to do
is<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> knife<00:01:26.189> cancel<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
is you get a knife cancel out with your

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
is you get a knife cancel out with your
throwing<00:01:27.390> knife<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.380> you've<00:01:28.530> helped<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> the

and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.750> reload<00:01:43.229> instantly<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.250> literally

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and then reload instantly so literally

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
and then reload instantly so literally
when<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.509> switch<00:01:45.810> you're<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> press

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
when you switch you're going to press

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.580 
when you switch you're going to press
reload<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.460> fast<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.240> possible<00:01:48.299> literally

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
reload as fast as possible literally

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
reload as fast as possible literally
so<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> doesn't<00:01:50.909> matter<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.240> long<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.539> hold

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so it doesn't matter how long you hold

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
so it doesn't matter how long you hold
through<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.770> practice<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
through now this is just to practice and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
through now this is just to practice and
get<00:01:53.399> handle<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.119> goes<00:01:54.149> switch<00:01:54.719> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
get handle it but here goes switch and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.490 
get handle it but here goes switch and
then<00:01:54.960> reload<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:56.460> should<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> zoom<00:01:57.030> mode

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
then reload it should be the zoom mode

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.630 
then reload it should be the zoom mode
it's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> straightforward<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.429> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
it's a straightforward as that and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.249 
it's a straightforward as that and
basically<00:02:00.119> when<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.539> do<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.929> hang<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
basically when you do get the hang of it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
basically when you do get the hang of it
you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:02.429> it<00:02:02.579> every<00:02:02.759> single<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.090> we

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you can just do it every single time we

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
you can just do it every single time we
jump<00:02:04.439> off<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:07.819> bounced

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
jump off and just you know it's bounced

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
jump off and just you know it's bounced
timing<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.509> said<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> can't<00:02:10.200> do<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
timing like I said if you can't do it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770 
timing like I said if you can't do it
and<00:02:10.799> then<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.540> probably

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and then you can do it you can probably

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.380 
and then you can do it you can probably
do<00:02:13.019> every<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> time<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.150> what's<00:02:15.150> cool

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
do every all the time and what's cool

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
do every all the time and what's cool
about<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.470> can't<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.160> zoom

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
about it is you can't just do one zoom

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
about it is you can't just do one zoom
mode<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.000> cancel<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:18.690> with

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
mode you can just cancel out with

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.990 
mode you can just cancel out with
anything<00:02:19.470> throwing<00:02:20.129> knife<00:02:20.310> claim<00:02:20.700> or

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
anything throwing knife claim or

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.479 
anything throwing knife claim or
tactical<00:02:21.840> insertion<00:02:21.930> stun<00:02:22.530> grenades<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
tactical insertion stun grenades just a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.330 
tactical insertion stun grenades just a
normal<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.299> works<00:02:24.510> all<00:02:24.780> round<00:02:25.340> it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
normal now if it works all round it's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.650 
normal now if it works all round it's
not<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.489> hard<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> change<00:02:27.480> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
not that hard and you can do a change of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.240 
not that hard and you can do a change of
them<00:02:27.870> kazoom<00:02:28.470> loads<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.799> not<00:02:28.920> too<00:02:29.069> sure<00:02:29.220> if

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
them kazoom loads I'm not too sure if

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.780 
them kazoom loads I'm not too sure if
it'll<00:02:29.430> work<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.790> me<00:02:29.849> now<00:02:29.970> I'll<00:02:30.180> try

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.059 

but<00:02:34.450> yeah<00:02:34.599> like<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.709> could<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
but yeah like that and you could do that

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.009 
but yeah like that and you could do that
in<00:02:36.189> midair<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.579> it<00:02:36.700> looks<00:02:36.849> super<00:02:37.269> clean<00:02:37.540> super

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
in midair and it looks super clean super

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
it's probably because of the fact that

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.259
