 and today's update will be about such 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.510
 five-story building and taxis 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 well then let's begin perhaps with 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 five-story buildings here I call this five-story building 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 a point because it is so well 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 one front and looks so well than 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.030
 Here from the satellite it seems like a point more precisely 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.160
 above that 's basically let's 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 let's see there is planning let's 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.460
 prescribe shields etc. that's basically what it is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 Floor 5 is different from the rest 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.570
 this is a five-story building so to say economy class 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 That is, the apartment here is cheap well, it seems 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.420
 it's all in imagination in general she is so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.790
 equipment 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 well let's go inside we see 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.220
 layouts 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 damn how is it not convenient for me that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 microphone then I rearranged something me 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 better heard here coloratura me in general 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 nowhere to put it like that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 hands hold her 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 Well, in general, that's how it is in principle 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.420
 let our looks such a staircase 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 for not looking inside our planning 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 well here we have this from 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.939
 usual contact us two beds 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.840
 there are two stoves in the kitchen 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.729
 and a table with a chair 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 microphone falls so that's all right by such a 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.810
 we have a ladder 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 now climb up 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.050
 so to the holes of the knockers climb something 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.700
 it seems like six floors 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.560
 here is the exit to the roof and such from us 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.340
