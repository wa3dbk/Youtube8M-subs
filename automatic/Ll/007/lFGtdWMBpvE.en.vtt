00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 how about movie friends gamers and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.480
 welcome to the continuation of the video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.360
 63 on this occasion as well let's 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.540
 show them how we went through the challenge 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 this I keep telling you magic chess 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.540
 good as I told you in the previous video 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 remember that here I leave the button to 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.410
 principle in case you want to see that and in the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.849
 description of the video I put them in the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 minute where we already take the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.140
 collectable in case it's what you're 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 looking for this as I told them or they 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.220
 I commented on the previous video this is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.870
 a lot of luck that is not saying that 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.940
 there's good I'm going to move this piece and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 there, I will not move, no, this is not 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 totally lucky to see you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 wants to go out and see what comes out of this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 the hour 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.670
 this 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.020
 or the most practical advice is that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.850
 the informants who are the two 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.290
 characters from the center this ones 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 have as the staff are the most 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.360
 powerful with two attacks or destroy 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.710
 any enemy and the bishops of one 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.809
 but hey this is very vision 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.670
 weak indeed if you do not leave the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.040
 memory any character be they the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.660
 vampires the wolves of an attack are 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.700
 action of the zombies besides that the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 zombies are taken out by the micro lovers 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.320
 this 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.240
 Then, as they are the strongest 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.590
 are the ones that need to be taken care of the best 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990
 If they were our queens, they are our 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.460
 Kings say if we kill 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.830
 we have not lost the game but 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 technically we already lost because almost not 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.399
 we are going to do it without them 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 Another piece of advice I can give you is 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.909
 example more or less the distance in the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.200
 that I am in which I do not try to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.240
 move I try to stay in this 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.689
 and well another thing that they already knew 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.149
 same and not for new people is that 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.829
 as we are losing pieces or laura 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.810
 go losing pieces are going to have more 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.979
 shifts or she's going to have more shifts this 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.720
 what does it mean that for example when 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.460
 already 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.080
 and here we have two pieces already going to have 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.940
 two shifts and we say that only 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.410
 let's keep having one if you take away two 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.380
 pieces then we will also have 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.080
 two consecutive shifts has been two 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 new times I two or two times nine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.340
 them and twice again me and so 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.340
 consecutively the same and so I think it is 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.280
 up to three times this to ice four 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.450
 times to the thread then the problem is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.660
 when they are already three or four times 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.510
 to the thread because son there if it is already 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.160
 you have very good luck in that you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.280
 come out the things you need and that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.020
 she does not leave anything for example that no 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 you are getting rid of their beasts and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.140
 let's say that he is a werewolf but 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.600
 I do not have a werewolf then he 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.330
 she turned already was wasted for her this 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.980
 is the 50 who decides what they say to him then 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.730
 you already like your turn you went wolf and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.709
 Well, you lost it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 what happened to us in this video 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.220
 after several attempts I do not know I was 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.000
 here playing it for an hour until 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.280
 end it came out 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.680
 this 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.360
 As you can see she has already lost two 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 pieces and we have lost it to a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.550
 so here we are going to give 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.560
 already saw she is not attacking there are two 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.140
 times and we still only have one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.220
 I'm usually trying to see 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.630
 if the increase can already be there then this 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.190
 attacking someone is because you can then 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.710
 that no advantage if you can not because 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.360
 then we already see the possibility of 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.970
 leave a zombie because it can be 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.460
 generally the enemy is to achieve 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.280
 prefer to get rid of the zombie then 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.020
 from us good this time 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 curiously this was not the occasion 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.460
 but let's attack it with all 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.160
 we already got rid of this 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.630
 now we have to play it and 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.630
 move it a little later 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.340
 for gift say for here ok 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.630
 for example right now this will no longer work 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.880
 have man is then then there 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.640
 he lost this one of his two lathes that already 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.980
 I had fortunately 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.260
 and I could not do anything we changed pieces 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.910
 to see if I can do something here 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.400
 so I think I'm going to leave this one 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.400
 zombie so that it distracts him and they 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.360
 guatazo I touch me again I think 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.200
 that I'm going to choose the zombie so that 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.200
 attack one of them 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.960
 that lowers me very little and they will have to pay 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.160
 like six to nine times with a zombie 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.160
 to get rid of an enemy 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.030
 ok then here's the thing 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.380
 attacking 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:35.790
 here we go up life we ​​prefer that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.790
 and things are already moving 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.560
 I do not know how to put up with that vampire but 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.380
 how do you hold 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.240
 and that then hits good bastard and 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.210
 for example and achieved lost all his 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.130
 shifts it was well of eggs that's why they 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.360
 I insist that this is a lot of luck more 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.360
 of another thing 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.070
 let's put someone there and not us 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.070
 let them do something else 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.630
 and good only of their returns 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.420
 fortunately he only uses one that was 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.010
 well chivas in that we can lose up 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.660
 maximum three pieces if we lose one 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.370
 fourth is already worth a peanut of this 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.550
 so then you have to hope not to lose 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.550
 plus 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.040
 we can not do much then we're going to 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.040
 put again there is a zombie if I 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.879
 of doing that are seen that through 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.840
 and the girl got lucky 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.800
 let's attack here 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.670
 let's have opportunities we go back to 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.740
 put a sound and rule and the zombies and 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.510
 they can kill us all they want and 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.180
 nothing happens to us that does not count as 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.500
 piece then for those those good 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.500
 strategy is wearing zombies 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.949
 the crazy for me 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.949
 and there is only one piece left to the aura 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.319
 and he was lucky 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.720
 and twice consecutive fox fox well 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.500
 we will gain life to climb what 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.500
 our is a little 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.449
 let's put a zombie here 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.009
 then then then great is losing 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.930
 all his shifts that was very good very 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.860
 very well 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.860
 to keep attacking 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.570
 we're going to attack him now so why 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.570
 the back 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.890
 and to treat one that loses it completito 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.890
 it is this 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.849
 and ready with that we passed the challenge be 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:04.559
 they will give 1500 when they pass it 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.239
 matter if they stay with a piece or with 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.969
 all three here is the collectible that 

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.129
 we needed 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.049
 and fortunately with this we also 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.759
 We raise the blue magic, what good because 

00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:15.439
 things are getting more and more 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.879
 interesting and it's better to be fine 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.879
 striking to achieve it 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.340
 and it will happen if we finish we just need 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.960
 go to here to be told that 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.539
 we finish this in 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.949
 110% as always I hope to see them 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.330
 helped friends remember that a like 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.830
 it helps the channel a lot if they have any 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.970
 doubt or comment and we can 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.970
 help then here we are
