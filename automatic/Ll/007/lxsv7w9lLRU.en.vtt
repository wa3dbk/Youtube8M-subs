00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
told in the tool box if I want to use a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
told in the tool box if I want to use a
different<00:00:55.649> something<00:00:56.510> ok<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.750> now

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
different something ok so right now

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.979 
different something ok so right now
let's<00:00:58.230> try<00:00:58.530> trouble<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.809> more

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
let's try trouble because I put more

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's try trouble because I put more
resistors<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> can't<00:01:02.129> find<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.699> have

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
resistors and I can't find them I have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.859 
resistors and I can't find them I have
whisper<00:01:03.270> sister<00:01:03.750> scattered<00:01:04.170> everywhere<00:01:05.270> um<00:01:06.270> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
whisper sister scattered everywhere um I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
did have that retort and batteries I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.780 
did have that retort and batteries I
have<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.600> panel<00:01:11.270> right<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.299> showing

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
have my little panel right now showing

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.620 
have my little panel right now showing
trouble<00:01:14.790> Bell<00:01:15.270> circuit<00:01:16.850> -<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
trouble Bell circuit - and then the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
trouble Bell circuit - and then the
whole<00:01:18.930> box<00:01:19.560> bedroom<00:01:19.920> hallway<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
whole box bedroom hallway that's the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
whole box bedroom hallway that's the
bestest<00:01:20.820> program<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
bestest program for right now and the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.899 
bestest program for right now and the
camera<00:01:23.280> down<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> holy<00:01:24.240> heart

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.800 

I<00:01:31.850> just<00:01:32.850> closed<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> curtains<00:01:33.569> you<00:01:33.659> can

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
I just closed the curtains you can

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.680 
I just closed the curtains you can
probably<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> glow<00:01:34.439> better

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.580 

so<00:01:39.690> if<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> hit<00:01:39.960> acknowledge<00:01:41.060> step<00:01:42.260> it<00:01:43.260> was<00:01:43.440> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so if I hit acknowledge step it was the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.680 
so if I hit acknowledge step it was the
next<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:46.850> she<00:01:47.850> sent<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.150> March<00:01:48.450> time

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
next one okay she sent for March time

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.260 
next one okay she sent for March time
right<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:48.960> we'll<00:01:49.260> show<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.650> clip<00:01:49.860> three<00:01:50.270> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
right now we'll show a clip three for

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.240 
right now we'll show a clip three for
temporal<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.410> when<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.620> pull<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
temporal so when I pull this it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.970 
temporal so when I pull this it
activates<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.240> tells<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:01.050> say<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
activates this and tells it say a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
into one whole programming out I'm gonna

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.220 
into one whole programming out I'm gonna
change<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> coding<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.220> hit<00:03:22.400> enter<00:03:23.080> then<00:03:24.080> it

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
change the coding so I hit enter then it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.020 
change the coding so I hit enter then it
says<00:03:24.440> one<00:03:24.770> program<00:03:25.220> because<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.490> personal<00:03:25.850> one

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
says one program because I personal one

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.460 
says one program because I personal one
and<00:03:26.750> then<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.710> says<00:03:27.860> key<00:03:28.070> password<00:03:28.550> now<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:30.320> has

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
and then it says key password now it has

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.590 
and then it says key password now it has
a<00:03:30.500> ATT<00:03:31.100> UNAM<00:03:31.760> own<00:03:31.880> chip<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.240> it<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:32.480> it's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
a ATT UNAM own chip in it but it's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.670 
a ATT UNAM own chip in it but it's
actually<00:03:33.110> file<00:03:33.740> IMS<00:03:34.130> 9200<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.410> key

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
actually file IMS 9200 so have a key

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.590 
actually file IMS 9200 so have a key
password<00:03:37.460> for<00:03:37.580> programming<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.120> different<00:03:38.450> so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
password for programming is different so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:46.720 
password for programming is different so
it's<00:03:38.630> 6<00:03:39.790> 3<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.630> 10<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:44.660> hit<00:03:44.840> enter<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.520> says

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
it's 6 3 to 10 and hit enter and it says

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.720 
it's 6 3 to 10 and hit enter and it says

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
from the computer so I'm where it goes

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.700 
from the computer so I'm where it goes
to<00:03:54.260> leave<00:03:54.440> for<00:03:54.680> system<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:57.290> then<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.590> has<00:03:57.680> a

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
again and so now I hit the down arrow

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.710 
again and so now I hit the down arrow
I'm<00:04:09.680> gonna<00:04:09.860> hit<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.040> now<00:04:11.320> that's<00:04:12.320> no<00:04:12.500> coding

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
I'm gonna hit it now that's no coding
