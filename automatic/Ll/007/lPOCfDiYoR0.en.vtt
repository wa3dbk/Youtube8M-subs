00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
the perk and we're gonna change it from
a<00:01:28.500> novice<00:01:28.829> spell<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.549> an<00:01:29.670> apprentice<00:01:30.180> spell<00:01:30.479> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a novice spell to an apprentice spell so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
a novice spell to an apprentice spell so
you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.040> powerful<00:01:32.220> spell<00:01:32.700> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you know it's a more powerful spell so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
you know it's a more powerful spell so
it<00:01:32.970> should<00:01:33.180> require<00:01:33.350> another<00:01:34.350> perk<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.920> my

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it should require another perk in my

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
it should require another perk in my
opinion<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> but

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
opinion you don't have to do that but

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
opinion you don't have to do that but
that's<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.290> gonna<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.680> okay<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.299> we

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's what I'm gonna do okay so now we

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's what I'm gonna do okay so now we
have<00:01:39.689> our<00:01:39.869> spell<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.710> no<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.100> to
