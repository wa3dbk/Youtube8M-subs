00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
a pencil it also is easier because I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.820 
a pencil it also is easier because I
don't<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.270> all<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.539> range<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.259> motion<00:01:57.619> some

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
don't have all the range of motion some

don't have all the range of motion some
people<00:01:58.129> have<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.429> their<00:01:58.520> wrists<00:01:58.910> so<00:01:59.569> I<00:01:59.929> stick

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
people have in their wrists so I stick

people have in their wrists so I stick
with<00:02:00.649> my<00:02:00.890> pencil<00:02:01.129> grip<00:02:01.539> we<00:02:02.539> also<00:02:02.750> have<00:02:03.259> what's

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
with my pencil grip we also have what's

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.160 
with my pencil grip we also have what's
called<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.129> Thompson<00:02:04.700> grip<00:02:04.940> it's<00:02:05.780> meant<00:02:06.110> to

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
called the Thompson grip it's meant to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.770 
called the Thompson grip it's meant to
be<00:02:06.349> held<00:02:06.590> like<00:02:07.009> this<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.670> puts<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.209> real<00:02:08.509> close

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
be held like this it puts you real close

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.229 
be held like this it puts you real close
to<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.200> glass<00:02:09.440> some<00:02:10.129> people<00:02:10.429> feel<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.729> makes

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
to the glass some people feel that makes

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.540 
to the glass some people feel that makes
them<00:02:11.510> have<00:02:11.840> greater<00:02:12.470> control<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:13.220> their<00:02:13.370> on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
them have greater control on their on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.610 
them have greater control on their on
their<00:02:13.819> cutter<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.360> control<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.290> what<00:02:15.470> it's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
their cutter and control is what it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.059 
their cutter and control is what it's
all<00:02:15.770> about

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
all about

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.430 
all about
if<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.150> pet<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.510> Thompson<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.379> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
if you like to pet the Thompson this is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.170 
if you like to pet the Thompson this is
the<00:02:18.770> thing<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.069> have<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.150> a

the thing to have for you this is a

modified also by Thomas I said Tom

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.660 
modified also by Thomas I said Tom
Thomas<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.380> modified<00:02:25.950> Thomas<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
Thomas this is a modified Thomas and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.500 
Thomas this is a modified Thomas and
again<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.930> whole<00:02:28.170> idea<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.480> feel

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
again the whole idea that that you feel

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.660 
again the whole idea that that you feel
in<00:02:31.050> control<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.710> glass<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.220> again<00:02:32.490> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
in control of the glass so again this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.580 
in control of the glass so again this
puts<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> real<00:02:33.360> close<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.080> glass<00:02:34.320> when

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
puts you real close to the glass when

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.650 
puts you real close to the glass when
you're<00:02:34.680> holding<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.040> cutter<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.420> these

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you're holding the cutter all of these

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.860 
you're holding the cutter all of these
have<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.470> same<00:02:37.830> type<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.760> cutter<00:02:39.120> wheel<00:02:39.480> all

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
have the same type of cutter wheel all

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.870 
have the same type of cutter wheel all
of<00:02:40.020> them<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.350> less<00:02:40.530> expensive<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.370> plastic

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
of them are less expensive the plastic

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
of them are less expensive the plastic
handled<00:02:42.240> ones<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> little<00:02:42.780> less<00:02:43.050> expensive

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
handled ones are a little less expensive

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.300 
handled ones are a little less expensive
um<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.959> as<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.980> no

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
um they are just as good there is no

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.890 
um they are just as good there is no
reason<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> metal

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
reason that you have to have a metal

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.710 
reason that you have to have a metal
handle<00:02:49.350> cutter<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> lot<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.180> cutting

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
handle cutter if you do a lot of cutting

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.870 
handle cutter if you do a lot of cutting
the<00:02:52.110> handle<00:02:52.709> will<00:02:52.890> last<00:02:53.160> longer<00:02:53.459> if<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the handle will last longer if it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.330 
the handle will last longer if it's
metal<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> head<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.320> same<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.040> it's

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
metal but the head is the same so it's

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.490 
metal but the head is the same so it's
not<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> last<00:02:56.910> any<00:02:57.150> longer<00:02:57.239> all<00:02:58.110> of

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
not going to last any longer all of

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.530 
not going to last any longer all of
these<00:02:58.680> models<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.520> are<00:02:59.700> made<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.420> use

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
these models here are made to use

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.440 
these models here are made to use
cutting<00:03:00.930> oil<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.739> now<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.890> cutting<00:03:02.220> oil

traditionally<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.989> used<00:03:04.320> when<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.770> use<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
traditionally was used when you use a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.120 
traditionally was used when you use a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
steel wheel cutter at that point in time

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
steel wheel cutter at that point in time
you<00:03:08.340> needed<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> cutting<00:03:09.150> oil<00:03:09.300> removed

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
you needed it the cutting oil removed

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.670 
you needed it the cutting oil removed
the<00:03:10.910> dust<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.300> glass<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:13.020> prevented<00:03:13.620> the

the dust from the glass it prevented the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.790 
the dust from the glass it prevented the
cutter<00:03:13.920> head<00:03:14.160> from<00:03:14.430> rusting<00:03:15.030> um<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:16.200> carbide

tip cutters do not need oil some people
still<00:03:20.670> use<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> makes<00:03:21.330> them<00:03:21.510> feel

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
still use it it makes them feel

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
still use it it makes them feel
comfortable<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.739> makes<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.040> feel

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
comfortable if it makes you feel

comfortable if it makes you feel

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
comfortable you should use it it's not a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.780 
comfortable you should use it it's not a
terribly<00:03:25.110> expensive<00:03:25.320> product<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.340> does<00:03:26.580> get

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
terribly expensive product it does get

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.240 
terribly expensive product it does get
oil<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.209> your<00:03:27.360> glass<00:03:27.630> which<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.650> find<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.220> be

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
oil on your glass which I find to be

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.090 
oil on your glass which I find to be
inconvenient<00:03:29.880> one<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.140> only<00:03:31.620> thing<00:03:31.890> it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
inconvenient one of the only thing it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.800 
inconvenient one of the only thing it
really<00:03:32.610> does<00:03:33.030> if<00:03:33.209> you're<00:03:33.299> cutting<00:03:33.570> with<00:03:33.780> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
really does if you're cutting with a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.050 
really does if you're cutting with a
straight<00:03:34.230> edge<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.430> oil<00:03:35.610> will

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
straight edge is that that oil will

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
straight edge is that that oil will
sometimes<00:03:36.600> act<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.530> lubricate<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.100> straight

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
sometimes act to lubricate the straight

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.729 
sometimes act to lubricate the straight
edge<00:03:38.670> itself<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.900> your<00:03:40.049> cutter<00:03:40.260> will<00:03:40.470> slide

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
edge itself so your cutter will slide

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.250 
edge itself so your cutter will slide
easily<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.700> other<00:03:41.850> than<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.750> oil<00:03:42.959> is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
easily but other than that the oil is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.550 
easily but other than that the oil is
not<00:03:43.500> essential<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.810> say<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> lot<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.440> us

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
not essential but as I say a lot of us

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.410 
not essential but as I say a lot of us
in<00:03:46.739> glass<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.250> traditionalists<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.299> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
in glass are traditionalists and if you
