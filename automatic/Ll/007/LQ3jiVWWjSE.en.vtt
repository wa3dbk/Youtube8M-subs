00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello my name is Aliya 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.370
 and today I want to share with you my 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.120
 impressions after watching a movie 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.719
 the hobbit has already completed the movie trilogy by 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 here is this little thin little book 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.029
 Tolkien and I just hurry I hurry I hurry with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 to share with you what were not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.260
 impressions after i looked through all this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 Friday night movie the second day 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.050
 premieres and the hobbit battle of the five armies 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.670
 thought decided to leave him finally about 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 look along and actually this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 was so i just saw that mahadev 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 such lunch dinner world bets then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 missed that moment when that is years 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.660
 before the ace was when it started in general 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 i saw the hobbit coming and this is a rabbit and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 Jules will go however I will go games 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 great ticket this sang really 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.120
 when I went to the first part and the second 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 part I did not remember what was in general 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.539
 the book because I read the book probably 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 when i was 10 years old 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.410
 somewhere so yes probably at this age I 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.930
 read the book 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.570
 that is, all I remember is that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 that gandalf came to bilbo baggins and 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 told you that you want to go to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 adventure that kind of type they don't first 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 I want to go to lobni then I will go and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 ended up with bilbo again 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.400
 turned up at home I remembered the moment with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.659
 I remember the ring and I am the moment that the dwarves 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.890
 came to him for dinner but only with 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.150
 the main adventure i'm from the book 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 absolutely did not remember and when I looked 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.280
 the film it was just such a feeling there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.650
 such paints such a game of actors to me 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.380
 most surprised that the first movie 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.229
 the movie the hobbit began exactly as 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.090
 started with the first movie in the style of the rings 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.900
 this article is behind me all 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.100
 the lord of the rings collection and and 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.780
 there is coming down in everything in any series and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.550
 ends the film groups of underwear too so 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.410
 same as it started i really liked 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.630
 I like these plot twists here 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.940
 when he say exactly told 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.810
 the story is not just like that here 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420
 there was a hobbit 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.190
 but it all begins with the background of that I 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.920
 I will tell you now my real 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.960
 story and here we have all three films they 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.910
 tells us the story of bilbo baggins 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.460
 at the very beginning was generally very indignant 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.440
 how could such a little booklet be 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.220
 split into three films with you finally and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.110
 It was logical three books 3 films and usually 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.480
 the last book will give own another two 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.370
 parts it's all logical but how could 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.260
 divide the little hobbit into three 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.230
 parts for me was just not imagined 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.030
 and when I fly away , I was told that the movie 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.550
 they shot so they don't know which 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.350
 the part they take is probably everything was 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 logical one big movie which 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.490
 just for us broke into several 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 parts so that we do not sit 8 hours 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.810
 cinema that I really liked in 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.170
 last part of the hobbit 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.050
 this is what the film did not seem like debts 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.940
 there would be a two and a half hour session but 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.980
 it seemed like five minutes 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 huge plus to the movie because he was 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.720
 so dynamic despite the fact that 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.610
 of all the actions that took place 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.000
 the film this was in this battle of the five armies 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.370
 to humans, creatures just fought each 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 friend and it would seem that you can 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.850
 remove from the fact that they are fighting but that's all 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.100
 flew so fast so dynamic 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.769
 Tolkien certainly won my heart at all 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.330
 and sorrow now reread again 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.070
 the hobbit I will read further 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.590
 lord of the rings . silenka and fixes 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.390
 Unfortunately, I did not read it, but of course 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.100
 I watched all the movies I really films I already 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.410
 I also hardly remember how long ago 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.640
 the boulevard when he came in for the first time what 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.910
 I really want to say about 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.890
 Hobbit books and all the series that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.810
 I have a very strange translation in the book 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.880
 when I happened to the article outlined 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.209
 that bilbo baggins me not baggins top 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.549
 dance 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.230
 that I was very surprised want the lord 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.330
 rings this same series i have baggins 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.450
 continue to be baggins apparently 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.300
 some strange translators 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.190
 and half a day we tried to find salt from the book 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.160
 in the store gustin rings that can 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.300
 buy cathedral was with the right translation 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.250
 actually very few books 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.680
 correct translation all translate so 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.480
 how they want that very depressing but yes I 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.489
 I wanted to share my impression again 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.319
 of the movie I want to say one thing for me 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.730
 really did not like it looked like 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.329
 whether voice because in the first two parts 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.609
 he was even less natural but in 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.470
 the third installment of orlando bloom did 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.720
 just some kind of silicone 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.630
 stretched man 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.340
 then orangutan in silicone I would have it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.139
 called but because he is very 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.820
 looked unnaturally seemed to someone 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.830
 here it is just a bunch of it made up 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.930
 powder on the face here are these crazy blue 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.660
 the eyes of which I did everything I want 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.340
 open her to review parts of the lord 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.320
 rings to see how he is there 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.910
 still looked logical there was where 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.100
 younger and here the movie should have been 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.870
 do that he is younger than he is lord 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.260
 rings and apparently to do so naba 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.120
 I understood him after watching what 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.430
 still bilbo baggins and i love where 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.950
 more than frodo appeared I do not know why 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.900
 although i'm literally a couple of minutes ago 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.810
 again opened the beginning of the first 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.760
 hobbit I looked at frodo I understand 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.280
 that yes he is very similar to bilbo in 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.050
 youth that's perfect they got close 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.300
 attacks of actors who are at each other 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.750
 similar in habits even in the same 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.030
 the way they move 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.460
 martin of course in the role of bilbo it's just 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.490
 so will his true role be as far as 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.130
 he got accustomed to the stage looked again 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.919
 the first part is how does he even move like 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.590
 he walks like he says true bilbo 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.060
 baggins truths i probably all this 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.950
 trilogy worth visiting some 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.450
 separate video to tell completely in 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.200
 all impressions and probably will 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.599
 when i read the whole saga 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.150
 Tolkien and will reconsider all films and 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.729
 make a separate such smart 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.849
 separate such review on all films and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:55.080
 books all at once yes and so these were mine 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.039
 such a court spontaneous vague incomprehensible 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.590
 tell reasoning if you already 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.180
 watched this movie 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.010
 in which now just go to the box office 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.390
 you can still have time to write write 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.250
 in the comments you had 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.040
 impressions after this movie did you read 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.690
 are you a book or are you the first time like me after 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.330
 a long time to go to the movies and decided 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.040
 and reread or in communication did not read on 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.040
 this is all churches
