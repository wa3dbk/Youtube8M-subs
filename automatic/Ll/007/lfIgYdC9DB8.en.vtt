down to a 17 now i believe by little
dropping<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.340> his<00:01:26.430> pace<00:01:26.700> though<00:01:26.970> if

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
dropping that much at his pace though if

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.149 
dropping that much at his pace though if
you<00:01:27.509> mercy<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.049> 12<00:01:28.259> volt<00:01:28.439> Grady<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.009> had

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you mercy for 12 volt Grady actually had

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
you mercy for 12 volt Grady actually had
about<00:01:29.369> 83<00:01:29.970> pace<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> same

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
about 83 pace which is about the same

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.539 
about 83 pace which is about the same
and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.040> he'll<00:01:32.189> drop<00:01:32.340> too

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and I think that's what he'll drop too

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
and I think that's what he'll drop too
though<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.530> latest

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
though because I'm on on his latest
updates<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> stuff<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.610> pace<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.000> dropped

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
updates and stuff his pace has dropped

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
updates and stuff his pace has dropped
dramatically<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.990> don't<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:38.040> he's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
dramatically I don't know if he's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550

was proposed user compared to this one

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.469 
was proposed user compared to this one
basically<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.639> Grandma<00:04:34.000> he<00:04:34.150> hasn't<00:04:34.389> been

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479
