the<00:04:28.900> quickest<00:04:29.260> player<00:04:29.470> on<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> team<00:04:30.000> but<00:04:31.000> it

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
the quickest player on the team but it

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.739 
the quickest player on the team but it
don't<00:04:32.950> matter<00:04:33.220> that's<00:04:33.490> past<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.120> see<00:04:34.660> Regan

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:58.210 

and<00:04:40.749> go<00:04:40.989> for<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.229> gold<00:04:48.929> shot<00:04:49.929> from<00:04:50.079> over

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.060 

from<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.580> third<00:04:58.850> court

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:12.530 

shoots<00:05:05.930> scores<00:05:09.530> seconds<00:05:11.030> you<00:05:12.030> ain't<00:05:12.300> getting

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
shoots scores seconds you ain't getting

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
shoots scores seconds you ain't getting
it<00:05:12.630> easy<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:13.050> time

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.740 

but<00:05:22.430> obviously<00:05:22.610> that'll<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.270> last<00:05:23.480> check

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
but obviously that'll be the last check

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.600 
but obviously that'll be the last check
shot<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.020> can<00:05:24.139> use<00:05:24.470> for<00:05:24.500> at<00:05:25.160> least<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.460> half

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
shot I can use for at least a half

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:48.440 
shot I can use for at least a half
