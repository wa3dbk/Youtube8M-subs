00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 m 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.419
 mans complains about week 14 summer it's also 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.429
 a handicap 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.230
 marine in 14 holes 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 to eat well 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859
 against us 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.859
 on musical color outfits 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.570
 we saw a priori 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.080
 something so simple 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.360
 the two lovers 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 we are going to dissect the sound that lies to us number 2 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.610
 but it's still a bit like that it says 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 if I play the game it's very clean 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 I just have a bit of a mouth 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 to make the point with them 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.120
 if you are a little cleaner 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 we are finally 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.090
 you are responsible for the content of this release so like that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.980
 likewise they are long enough to make 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 the meaning of these same unions plus competition england 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 because of the classical age 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.100
 but pulling people to follow the program so once in the round 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 at the risk of multiple injuries 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.280
 she dreams hamilton 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.320
 certainly not 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 m 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 and so I believe they are where 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949
 bombs in the south 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.949
 Roman 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 and that's my case 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.929
 so on this metronome still prostituting himself 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.089
 at 70 euros the month 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.769
 I feel the group 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 James Brown, this is gone 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.169
 em 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.649
 he 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.649
 a little sentence 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.419
 to make the link 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.419
 find them 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.949
 maybe not 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.879
 yes of course yes 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 direct hint for 9 million doses for a next 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.929
 yeah
