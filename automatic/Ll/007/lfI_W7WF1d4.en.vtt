email issue if you've not configured it

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.339 
email issue if you've not configured it
correctly<00:00:10.740> or<00:00:11.040> perhaps<00:00:11.580> your<00:00:12.349> current

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that so that's where we come in we have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.150 
that so that's where we come in we have
a<00:00:22.439> simple<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.460> forget<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:24.180> solution

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
a simple set it and forget it solution

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.740 
a simple set it and forget it solution
you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.310> quickly<00:00:26.550> configure<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.599> your

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
you can quickly configure this on your

issues<00:00:31.410> they'll<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> thing<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> past<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
issues they'll be a thing of the past I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.130 
issues they'll be a thing of the past I
don't<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> lose<00:00:36.149> anyone<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.930> let's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
don't want to lose anyone here so let's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
don't want to lose anyone here so let's
just<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:39.170> SMTP<00:00:40.170> server<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.390> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
just go over what a SMTP server is you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
just go over what a SMTP server is you
have<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.780> incoming<00:00:43.320> server<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> iPhone

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
have your incoming server for the iPhone

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
have your incoming server for the iPhone
and<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.480> emails<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and that's how you get emails into the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.060 
and that's how you get emails into the
iPhone<00:00:47.510> but<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.200> difficult<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.039> find

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
iPhone but it is very difficult to find

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
iPhone but it is very difficult to find
a<00:00:50.670> reliable<00:00:52.250> SMTP<00:00:53.250> server<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.239> connect<00:00:54.629> those

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a reliable SMTP server to connect those

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
a reliable SMTP server to connect those
incoming<00:00:55.530> messages<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.760> reply<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
incoming messages so you can reply to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
incoming messages so you can reply to
messages<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.710> send<00:00:59.010> those<00:00:59.160> messages

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
messages and then send those messages

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.039 
messages and then send those messages
out<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> iPhone<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.250> basically

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
out from the iPhone so that's basically

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.160 
out from the iPhone so that's basically
what<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.339> SMTP<00:01:05.339> server<00:01:05.670> does<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.210> pushes<00:01:06.689> emails

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
what a SMTP server does it pushes emails

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.390 
what a SMTP server does it pushes emails
out<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> send<00:01:10.710> emails<00:01:11.159> from

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
out so that you can send emails from

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.320 
out so that you can send emails from
your<00:01:11.580> iPhone<00:01:12.799> by<00:01:13.799> design<00:01:14.220> iPhone<00:01:14.850> does<00:01:15.119> not

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
your iPhone by design iPhone does not

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.499 
your iPhone by design iPhone does not
provide<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.960> outgoing<00:01:16.409> server<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.509> actually

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
provide an outgoing server and actually

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
provide an outgoing server and actually
many<00:01:18.720> companies<00:01:19.170> companies<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.310> provide

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
many companies companies do not provide

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.870 
many companies companies do not provide
an<00:01:20.909> outgoing<00:01:21.450> server<00:01:21.860> at<00:01:22.860> least<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
an outgoing server at least not when you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
an outgoing server at least not when you
connect<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> third<00:01:24.900> party<00:01:25.170> device

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
connect them to a third party device

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.109 
connect them to a third party device
like<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> iPhone<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.060> Microsoft<00:01:27.630> Outlook

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
like the iPhone or Microsoft Outlook

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.069 
like the iPhone or Microsoft Outlook
there's<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.600> reason<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
there's good reason for that of

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
there's good reason for that of
companies<00:01:34.079> loose<00:01:34.470> control<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.189> outgoing

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
companies loose control of outgoing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.350 
companies loose control of outgoing
emails<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> few<00:01:38.640> spammers<00:01:39.150> on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
emails and if you have a few spammers on

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.130 
emails and if you have a few spammers on
your<00:01:39.509> network

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
your network

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.639 
your network
sending<00:01:40.979> spam<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.729> doing<00:01:42.000> what<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.649> they

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
sending spam and doing what they do they

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.580 
sending spam and doing what they do they
can<00:01:43.829> ruin<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.250> entire<00:01:44.700> domain<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> your

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
can ruin your entire domain and your

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.149 
can ruin your entire domain and your
entire<00:01:46.860> network<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.640> everybody<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
entire network for everybody so that is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.730 
entire network for everybody so that is
the<00:01:50.670> most<00:01:50.909> likely<00:01:51.149> reason<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.869> larger

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the most likely reason that larger

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.819 
the most likely reason that larger
companies<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.930> companies<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:54.990> iPhone<00:01:55.619> do

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
companies and companies like iPhone do

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.109 
companies and companies like iPhone do
not<00:01:56.009> provide<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> outgoing<00:01:57.000> server<00:01:59.119> free

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
not provide the outgoing server free

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.319 
not provide the outgoing server free
servers<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.719> becoming<00:02:01.049> extinct<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.329> even

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
servers are becoming extinct of even

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
servers are becoming extinct of even
companies<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.049> Gmail<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
companies like Gmail that for the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.540 
companies like Gmail that for the
longest<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.180> provided<00:02:06.799> free<00:02:07.799> outgoing
