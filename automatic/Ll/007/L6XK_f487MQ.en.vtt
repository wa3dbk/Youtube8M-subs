Scandinavia and this is no ordinary
aircraft<00:01:04.050> because<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.009> in<00:01:05.190> fact<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.759> new

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
aircraft because it is in fact a new

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
aircraft because it is in fact a new
variation<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.440> been<00:01:07.649> doing

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
variation of what we have been doing

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
variation of what we have been doing
it's<00:01:08.399> a<00:01:08.520> 2<00:01:08.670> class<00:01:08.850> aircraft<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.350> actually

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's a 2 class aircraft and it actually

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's a 2 class aircraft and it actually
seats<00:01:11.270> 615<00:01:12.270> seats<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> look<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
seats 615 seats so when I look at the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.639 
seats 615 seats so when I look at the
blocks<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.550> people<00:01:14.940> here<00:01:15.210> today

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
blocks of people here today

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.060 
blocks of people here today
that's<00:01:16.649> one<00:01:17.040> flight<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:18.479> another<00:01:18.750> one

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
that's one flight and that's another one

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.740 
that's one flight and that's another one
just<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:22.619> rest<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.399> Lufthansa

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
just about with the rest for Lufthansa

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
just about with the rest for Lufthansa
anyway<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> we'd<00:01:30.660> like<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.410> we

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
anyway but we'd like to think that we

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.889 
anyway but we'd like to think that we
bring<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.190> value<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.270> cities<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> we

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
bring our value to the cities that we

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.140 
bring our value to the cities that we
serve<00:01:34.280> despite<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.399> fact<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.909> have

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
serve despite the fact that we have

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.920 
serve despite the fact that we have
clearly<00:01:37.100> upset<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> few<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.580> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> way

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
clearly upset a few people on the way

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.200 
clearly upset a few people on the way
one<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.220> mantras<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.520> ethos<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> our

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
one of the mantras the ethos of our

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
one of the mantras the ethos of our
operation<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.010> innovate

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
operation is the need to innovate

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.000 
operation is the need to innovate
constantly<00:01:44.990> constantly<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.530> after

constantly constantly going after

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.590 
constantly constantly going after
everything<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.390> nothing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
everything we do because there's nothing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.380 
everything we do because there's nothing
worse<00:01:49.100> than<00:01:50.100> something<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.790> goes<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.360> a
