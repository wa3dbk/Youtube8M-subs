00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 do not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.730
 Garcia is already looking to tell us about 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.309
 this strange primate that inhabits 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.570
 only on the island of Madagascar like this 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.830
 it's me I read very good afternoon a taste 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.810

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.700
 friends this is treated everyone to 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.890
 all to our friend and fellow Victor 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.869
 vega for him and for everyone else 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 mates and friends this the hh 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.480
 mother nature created beings 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.050
 extraordinary equipped with tools 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.670
 and weapons to survive 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 unfortunately for their appearance they are created 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 false legends that have served 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 just to hurt them an example 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.190
 of this is that of a rare primate that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 Despite its appearance, it is related to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.440
 the apes and the human being lives 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.899
 only in the thick forests 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.360
 wetlands of the island of Madagascar where 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.880
 they take advantage of a gift that nature 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 gave to feed on fruits and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 insects especially the larvae that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.640
 They live from the bark of trees he 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.040
 has a unique tool in the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 world a long thin finger of 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 approximately about 15 centimeters with 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.009
 the one that hits the trunks to locate his 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 food their huge ears go into 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 action at that time 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.119
 but your ear serves to echo locate 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 perfectly in the long run and then 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.950
 he uses his powerful teeth to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 bite the bark and with its length 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.710
 pain 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.009
 He takes out his food in a way 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.590
 extraordinary are nocturnal animals and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.049
 very rarely come down from the high glasses 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.720
 of the tropical jungle where they move with 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.790
 ease thanks to its long tail that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.209
 it serves as a counterweight to jump 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 between the branches without falling from the heights 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.489
 They are between 45 and 50 centimeters long 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.400
 while his tail reaches 60 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.680
 centimeters his hair is black in almost 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.470
 whole body with some parts of the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 chest in light tones and big eyes that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.680
 they help you to have an excellent 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 night vision 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.480
 sadly his unpleasant image for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.930
 the eyes of the human being has brought him 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 many indigenous problems of madagascar 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.019
 believe that the aie brings bad omens 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.810
 this motive is often killed this 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.090
 house and the destruction of their habitat have 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.970
 put in grave danger to the Greek 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.180
 I fortunately is already protected by the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.180
 law 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.330
 13 in the pike garcÃ­a estrada 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.480
 Lucio asked what we 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.890
 we look like we are primates too I think 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.830
 that of all the animals that we have 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.540
 had here in the animal site is without 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.790
 doubt the strangest we have had a 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.190
 hole and there they say we all have 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.170
 finger rude and certainly sometimes they 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.430
 we give sometimes not today it appears very 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.930
 interesting that through their 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.490
 proposals we can enrich this 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.620
 space because that's not all of them 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.750
 we know all the animals and what 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.460
 better if anyone can suggest us some 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.500
 that he has met on a trip or that 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.660
 give classes or some little boy out there that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.350
 is interested in knowing an animal 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.120
 animal instinct made man 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.190
 we meet them all meets all 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.110
 through facebook is pike 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.170
 Garcia and a greeting took advantage quickly 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.330
 for barbarian caves for sergio alfaro and 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.330
 for daniel lopez
