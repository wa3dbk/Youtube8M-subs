00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
phase one 22:08 voltage so that's good

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.939

the<00:01:24.039> generator<00:01:24.490> let<00:01:25.240> me<00:01:25.299> say

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.499 

it's<00:01:28.810> all<00:01:28.960> complete<00:01:30.000> except<00:01:31.000> for<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.240> exhaust

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
it's all complete except for the exhaust

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.480 
it's all complete except for the exhaust
but<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.439> big<00:01:32.619> deal<00:01:33.359> propane<00:01:34.359> regulator<00:01:35.490> but

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
but the big deal propane regulator but

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.940 
but the big deal propane regulator but
it<00:01:36.579> also<00:01:36.729> has<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.890> carburetor<00:01:39.520> that's<00:01:40.119> good

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it also has the carburetor that's good

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.980 
it also has the carburetor that's good
not<00:01:41.950> really<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.369> propane<00:01:42.819> now<00:01:45.869> everything<00:01:46.869> in

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
not really the propane now everything in

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.399 
not really the propane now everything in
their<00:01:47.170> works<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:48.009> head<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.310> run<00:01:48.429> this<00:01:48.579> yet<00:01:48.880> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
their works the head and run this yet I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.899 
their works the head and run this yet I
hadn't<00:01:50.409> have<00:01:50.500> any<00:01:50.619> space<00:01:50.860> home<00:01:51.159> for<00:01:51.549> it<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:51.880> I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
hadn't have any space home for it so I

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.480 
hadn't have any space home for it so I
just<00:01:52.329> put<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.920> back<00:01:54.039> of<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:54.250> truck

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
just put it in the back of the truck

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.419 
just put it in the back of the truck
here<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.969> I<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:55.539> kind<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.079> work<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:56.619> here

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.839 

okay

damn here tap selector sorry can't see

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.809 
damn here tap selector sorry can't see
it<00:02:11.260> really<00:02:11.349> well<00:02:11.470> like<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.099> overspray

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
it really well like this overspray

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.600 
it really well like this overspray
everywhere

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.900 

the<00:02:46.260> h4d<00:02:46.980> engine<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.720> says<00:02:48.990> bhp<00:02:49.950> 18<00:02:50.490> I'm<00:02:50.760> not

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the h4d engine it says bhp 18 I'm not

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.550 
the h4d engine it says bhp 18 I'm not
sure<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.390> means

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
sure that means

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.280 
sure that means
horsepower<00:02:53.560> 18<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.580> think<00:02:54.910> before<00:02:55.570> doing<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
horsepower 18 I think before doing that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:05.540 
horsepower 18 I think before doing that
but

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.820 

yep<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.630> that's<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.960> one

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
yep so that's that one

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.280 
yep so that's that one
other<00:03:09.370> thing<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.820> here<00:03:10.270> that's<00:03:10.750> another<00:03:10.990> Cola

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
other thing in here that's another Cola

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.150 
other thing in here that's another Cola
