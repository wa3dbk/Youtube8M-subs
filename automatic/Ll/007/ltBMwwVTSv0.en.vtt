00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.789
 all and welcome to a new video 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 today i'm going to show you how i am 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.299
 its so dirty you get late care 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.890
 many questions about it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.480
 because in the end few videos that are whole 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.189
 often my hair actually with the front 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.990
 curls or strokes 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.460
 waves or whatever you want to call it so 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.050
 I that I will go over a tutorial once 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.849
 about doing it because I now get to wonder 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.170
 how we then done and example for 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.449
 each other went blah blah blah so anyway 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.300
 know i just make videos about this 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.980
 my hair of course i have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.199
 incredibly straight hair I have the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.909
 steepest port of the steepest port 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.129
 so today i'm going to show you how 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.670
 your hair can be safely safe without heat 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.500
 to have 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.659
 so the on my hard real parties i am 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.830
 enormously happy about how every time 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.479
 results look like 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.400
 so therefore I thought going hence even my 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.199
 method it how i can do my hair 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.909
 show and then maybe you can be there 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.199
 learn something so he doesn't know how to do it 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.790
 my hair I want to keep watching 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.949
 first let you need all you need 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.330
 I am not going to say ts hair spray 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.519
 you just have to have them 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.720
 this works and that is not just once 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.670
 to all products that I always use 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 so I can no longer use other hair spray 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.700
 scale under the marten became successful 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.950
 probably only I guarantee 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.259
 that it will work with these products 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.479
 you have the two small colorless 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.399
 elastiekjes 0 I have this film group from 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.920
 the teamwork then you need actor 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.439
 spray bottle that his body splash of 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.060
 H &amp; M there is a pot of water and as 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.859
 Christian does not necessarily water you 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.630
 to take hair sprays that I take 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.759
 but worries about it going forward 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.469
 and hair spray why prezi can't get out 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.149
 which are making another year 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.950
 color heart and then you can also 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.109
 hard and I personally don't think so 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.460
 nice to collect from can but its bedspread 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.799
 because they are a bit softer 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.359
 but I also want to see very backward 9 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.319
 wise person below to satin 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.719
 hair spray 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.159
 and I use the keratin seals 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.389
 but hairspray is basically mine 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.549
 favorite hair spray 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:53.590
 and smells super nice, it is very soft 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.929
 He is very beautiful hair from Campaert 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.380
 but I actually really use it 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.299
 in front of 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.889
 l hold what you just because they have 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.020
 I really good good good your hair and path 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.119
 then finally I use the andrÃ©lon 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.829
 mother 's necklace per spray 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 why do this this actually gives quite 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.459
 nice extra shine to your hair 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.750
 they look healthier and it leaves 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.600
 personally my curls helped beautiful 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 shiny 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.130
 over and above this also occurs 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.320
 first start with dry hair your hair 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.510
 completely wet then also works for none 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 meter because to go it just loose and if 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.840
 your hair is dry there also last meter and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.880
 then it becomes whole 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.010
 filthy and it no longer comes out 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.350
 I already had it so I just dry her 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.670
 and then I make it myself later or we took it 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.470
 going to do is actually our hair 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.940
 Braids often drink that mythology 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.860
 something very small just monsters genesis 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.240
 your heart is received but who in it 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.650
 I can get it more beautiful today 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.600
 show it as one with all my 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.850
 ask yes the longer you are in your hair 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.290
 I personally always sleep along but the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.180
 one person does not like a city 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.100
 understanding with braids can be annoying 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.600
 the longer the content, the more difficult 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.160
 they want to be there and how beautiful such a 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.750
 sit nicely and not anymore 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.790
 sleep a little to curl out for 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.160
 go eat I would say braid your hair 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.540
 around four and then whenever 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.100
 comes on before 8 o'clock 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.690
 the other your beautiful curls or 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.040
 Imagine you are going at 6 am 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.780
 braid year at two o'clock 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.940
 well we start and what i always do 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.920
 do i sepa my hair in here 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.780
 middle separation because then see your braid 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.700
 a little nicer I just do it and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 why should I feel our hair now 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.900
 braiding I explain once but 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.070
 You can do a lot here on YouTube too 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.360
 find tutorials 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.620
 and i'm not saying i perfect your 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.420
 hands don't do it i just do it 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.850
 actually in my when i understand i 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.860
 from this side the thinner your tufts 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.280
 makes thinner your curls 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.350
 to be 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.710
 so the bigger your tufts the more 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:40.190
 bigger your hobbies there are you here 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:41.810
 another tuft 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.350
 I do now is first start with one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.350
 normal braid 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.300
 gasket from under what close to what I am 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.580
 I ask her from re over it and 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.470
 then I saw that is also important 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 what you always rack is not too hard 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.490
 of course but missy just braids 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.760
 is pretty good tight or loose to go 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.100
 that I nearest club and with that 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.989
 I go over and I tighten that 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.060
 some hair from there 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.489
 and i do that on berries what i pick 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.430
 again her and I tighten it during 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.620
 I manage to teach her and then I pull 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.780
 a tight one and so that's how i got my 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.400
 braiding hair now it is important to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.169
 make sure you don't take it too much 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.330
 here let me go braid for this 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.590
 take care of them to the rear 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.180
 braid 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.770
 until your braid can also take 8 hours 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.720
 otherwise it really shouldn't be nice to have it whole 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.370
 long on peter and if you are not one 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.800
 behind your ears I will do that now 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.930
 I really aim a little more up so that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.380
 I do not suffer from mine 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.380
 gets 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.770
 And then you see that there is none on this side 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.590
 its more copper so you are done with 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.330
 it is going to fight in something like this 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.100
 I ask that I smoke nicely 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.870
 but I just stick with it or me now 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.070
 gonna do is i just gonna do it normally 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.900
 I braid my hair 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.900
 as many do go down 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.980
 at some point then you have none 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.630
 its more about that and you stubble on the 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.400
 way here then looks like can see 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.930
 I here a very long and a little less 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.190
 big and lovely little one 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.229
 I always do what is or is about 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.510
 geometry braid then I grab the little one 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.990
 this is the little one then i grab some hair 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.240
 from the larger 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.440
 and I do that about the little one and everything 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.760
 bad i again 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.919
 I have the same hearts again 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.419
 length and so I make sure I am up to 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.280
 as low as possible to fight through as 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.220
 of seeing and am i now having end 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.720
 reached of my hair and now I grab it 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.880
 transparent rubber band and with that I go 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.560
 it is finishing new so these sides we 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.560
 I'm going to buy this 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.940
 what i'm going to do now is i'm gonna my hair it 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.890
 we make them pack more moist 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.110
 later you speak it is in the bunch 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.300
 flash but in stream of water and with that go 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:15.580
 I wet my hair a little 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:17.140
 I shake a little bit all the way through 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.380
 the right to 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.730
 and must be a little moist though 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.480
 not as much as i do it a bit on 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.480
 feeling always 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:34.990
 now but me too are the soul or 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:37.240
 scanning 10 people praised me that too 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.400
 Andrelon times team hairspray is so 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.110
 for shine with navy moist minutes 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.680
 hair spray and I'm over here 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.700
 make mother a little softer and with spray 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.780
 from l'oreal 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.490
 I'm still good I hate the smell 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.290
 from annet i'm going to try to smile 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.540
 against evening tea i know i found my go 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.690
 and then I'll talk to you again tomorrow 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.520
 and then you see it the end result 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.740
 beautiful is now the next day i will now 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.510
 see my bad release and lost effect 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.510
 then i just keep them off 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.930
 And that's how I do my hair 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.699
 actually the only lick then do next 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.680
 first grab a hair spray so then 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.120
 I'm going to do what my keratin speaks 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.500
 I always need it more and I think 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.120
 the smell of the keratin plays better 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.500
 and it 's just a little air on the 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.300
 not too much of another 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.300
 taste of rubber heart and you don't want that 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:35.199
 so that's actually how i like my hair i 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:37.300
 wanna be your a nice video let me
