this video is not going to have another
optic<00:00:13.200> update<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.950> haven't<00:00:14.099> picked

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
optic update because they haven't picked

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
optic update because they haven't picked
their<00:00:14.429> fourth<00:00:14.700> yet<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
their fourth yet as you know at the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
their fourth yet as you know at the
moment<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.619> make<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.510> anyway<00:00:18.510> first

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
moment that I make this so anyway first

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
moment that I make this so anyway first
off<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> biggest<00:00:21.090> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
off I think one of the biggest and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.170 
off I think one of the biggest and
strangest<00:00:22.109> things<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> fact<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> clay

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
strangest things is the fact that clay

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.250 
strangest things is the fact that clay
stir<00:00:24.769> was<00:00:25.769> dropped<00:00:26.460> from<00:00:27.150> complexity<00:00:27.960> which

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
stir was dropped from complexity which

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.790 
stir was dropped from complexity which
to<00:00:29.039> me<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.990> dumbest<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:31.619> ever

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to me is like the dumbest thing ever

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.770 
to me is like the dumbest thing ever
like<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.279> understand<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.300> black<00:00:33.570> ops

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

agent<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:10.310> which<00:01:11.310> leads<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.780> next

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
agent and which leads into this next

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
agent and which leads into this next
part<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> fact<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.220> karma<00:01:17.299> has

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
part which is the fact that karma has

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.640 
part which is the fact that karma has
decided<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> leave<00:01:19.170> NV<00:01:20.180> yep<00:01:21.200> karma<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.409> left

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
decided to leave NV yep karma has left

NV now and he has decided to join

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.050 
NV now and he has decided to join
complexity<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:29.970> about

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
complexity so that if you think about

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
complexity so that if you think about
that<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.509> two<00:01:30.570> seconds<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.439> mean<00:01:31.619> thatthat

that for two seconds I mean thatthat
scrim<00:01:32.340> 6<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> karma<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> same<00:01:33.570> team

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
scrim 6 and karma on the same team

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
scrim 6 and karma on the same team
that's<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.640> crazy<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.090> mean<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.860> whether<00:01:37.860> or

that's pretty crazy I mean I whether or
not<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.340> work<00:01:38.670> i<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.329> don't

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
not it's gonna work i I really don't

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
not it's gonna work i I really don't
know<00:01:40.110> nobody<00:01:41.070> knows<00:01:41.430> how<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.299> know

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
know nobody knows how these you know

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.520 
know nobody knows how these you know
these<00:01:42.420> teams<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.840> gonna<00:01:42.930> work<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.320> with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
these teams are gonna work out with

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
these teams are gonna work out with
these<00:01:43.560> new<00:01:43.890> rosters<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.899> mean<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.049> that's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
these new rosters but I mean that that's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.280 
these new rosters but I mean that that's
I<00:01:47.009> mean<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.369> still<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.570> really

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I mean that's still one really really

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.550 
I mean that's still one really really
stack<00:01:49.649> team<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.450> while<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> still

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
stack team and while I I think I still

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.399 
stack team and while I I think I still
think<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.060> keeping<00:01:54.659> clyster<00:01:55.110> was

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
think that you know keeping clyster was

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.300 
think that you know keeping clyster was
in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.140> long<00:01:58.320> run<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.890> much

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
in the you know in the long run a much

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
in the you know in the long run a much
better<00:01:59.549> decision<00:02:00.320> even<00:02:01.320> though<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> haven't

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
better decision even though I haven't

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
better decision even though I haven't
seen<00:02:02.100> any<00:02:02.280> tournaments<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.060> team<00:02:03.270> yet

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509

Karma's<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.660> complexity<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
Karma's now with complexity so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800 
Karma's now with complexity so
nobody<00:02:14.190> saw<00:02:14.400> those<00:02:14.880> two<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.300> changes

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
nobody saw those two little changes

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.880 
nobody saw those two little changes
coming<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.320> by<00:02:16.590> little<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.950> mean<00:02:17.100> huge<00:02:18.890> but

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
coming and by little I mean huge but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.140 
coming and by little I mean huge but
it's<00:02:20.040> funny<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.520> if<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> look<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.090> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it's funny because if you look at this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.840 
it's funny because if you look at this
tweet<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.870> Hector<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.670> he

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
tweet right here from Hector you know he

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.530 
tweet right here from Hector you know he
he<00:02:24.780> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.730> gave<00:02:26.730> away<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.210> least<00:02:27.360> for

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
he kind of like gave away at least for

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.240 
he kind of like gave away at least for
me<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.960> something<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.500> gonna<00:02:28.620> happen<00:02:28.710> with

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
me that something was gonna happen with

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.540 
me that something was gonna happen with
complexity<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:31.500> he<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.310> fact

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
complexity because when he is the fact

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150 
complexity because when he is the fact
that<00:02:32.670> they<00:02:32.940> were<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:33.870> talking<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.650> that

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
right here goon jar decided to leave TK

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.710 
right here goon jar decided to leave TK
and<00:03:15.920> he<00:03:16.920> has<00:03:17.040> decided<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.670> join<00:03:17.850> NV<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.480> he's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
and he has decided to join NV so he's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.550 
and he has decided to join NV so he's
taking<00:03:19.110> karma<00:03:19.590> spot<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.350> another

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
taking karma spot and this is another

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.620 
taking karma spot and this is another
one<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.800> those<00:03:22.920> bizarre<00:03:23.460> things<00:03:23.850> because<00:03:24.300> team

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
one of those bizarre things because team

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.040 
one of those bizarre things because team
kaliber<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.850> honestly<00:03:26.850> think<00:03:27.180> had<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.780> biggest

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
kaliber I honestly think had the biggest

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.050 
kaliber I honestly think had the biggest
chance<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.890> win<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.780> win<00:03:32.060> umg

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
chance to win and you know win umg

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.840 
chance to win and you know win umg
Philly<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.600> knock<00:03:34.380> off<00:03:34.560> complexity<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.730> know

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
Philly and knock off complexity you know

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.380 
Philly and knock off complexity you know
but<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:37.530> weird<00:03:38.100> now<00:03:38.490> like<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:38.820> know<00:03:39.030> if

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
but it's weird now like I don't know if

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.120 
but it's weird now like I don't know if
maybe<00:03:39.630> mercs<00:03:40.050> meal<00:03:40.320> with<00:03:40.470> them<00:03:40.620> or<00:03:40.860> if<00:03:40.950> he's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
maybe mercs meal with them or if he's

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.470 
maybe mercs meal with them or if he's
gonna<00:03:41.310> retire<00:03:41.520> people<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.090> saying<00:03:42.300> he's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
gonna retire people are saying he's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.540 
gonna retire people are saying he's
retiring<00:03:42.870> I'm<00:03:43.170> not<00:03:43.290> sure<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:43.680> that's<00:03:43.800> true<00:03:44.490> or

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
retiring I'm not sure if that's true or

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.250 
retiring I'm not sure if that's true or
not<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.090> Tweety<00:03:45.420> he<00:03:45.900> tweeted<00:03:46.200> out

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
not because that Tweety he tweeted out

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
not because that Tweety he tweeted out
something<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:47.040> kind<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.460> like<00:03:47.610> cryptic

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
something like that kind of like cryptic

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.850 
something like that kind of like cryptic
like<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.270> earlier<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.050> don't<00:03:49.740> know<00:03:49.800> if

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
like that earlier but I don't know if

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.890 
like that earlier but I don't know if
that's<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.130> case<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:51.180> know<00:03:51.210> me<00:03:51.480> maybe

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that's the case you know me maybe

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.280 
that's the case you know me maybe
they'll<00:03:52.110> pick<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.350> j<00:03:52.530> cap<00:03:52.800> i<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.640> no<00:03:53.940> idea<00:03:54.290> you
