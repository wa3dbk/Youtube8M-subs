00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 Hey, people, my name is Sergio. 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
 rosemary 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.730
 Today I'm going to give you a lot of soil. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.580
 simple is on the pentatonic scale a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.920
 very easy way and with some details 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.199
 thing so well detailed even for you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.000
 who is a beginner at level zero I will never 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.980
 being in life knows nothing of what is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.439
 do not know who scale and everything else 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 I will spend here a very easy to soil 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.430
 You already start playing and you're naked. 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 Your friends look only at what I learned in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.849
 guitar 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.700
 the cesar romero channel, that's it 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:40.649
 Come on then in this video that you do not 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 You need to know only one thing 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.789
 positioning of the fingers in the shape of the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.559
 school try to tonic is how it would be 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.690
 this is going to show that the very basics of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 without attention to the notes or the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 theory because the same simplified wave 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 beginner is there 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.579
 first I will use the finger 11 and 14 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.120
 here on the string mi will stay like this no 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.120
 fine 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:26.330
 then 13 on the rope there then 13 on the rope 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:38.869
 until 13 at sun 14 and 14 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:41.090
 so the 4 3 3 with 13 14 or 4 is well 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.830
 simple full it is easy to record 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.959
 first step of the hour that recorded 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.240
 to the next step 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:52.670
 You're going to make the lady a giggle. 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:00.080
 so, how is it all on the rope? 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:05.989
 I'm going to do yes, I'll let it go home 3 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.269
 then I'm back at home three again and 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:11.560
 finishing every five 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.560
 wake up half will stay 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 is this the iv there you will score with 123 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.890
 beauty second part is this 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.349
 now we will try to join the two 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.349
 things on improvisation how are you going to stay 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.830
 O 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:23.299
 what I did right here invented this only 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.760
 I'll try to do it again probably 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.959
 I did not know how to do it because it was improvised. 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.060
 huh 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.819
 some sentences here are very simple as well 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.859
 easy even if i make you iff nÃ© that the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:48.049
 pickup the middle of the bridge to get too 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:49.699
 sharp is the middle holiday of the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.549
 Your name is also very serious. 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:59.979
 It happens that you do the river and I go. 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.979
 I play some notinhas in catholic tv 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:07.060
 1234 so let's play five notes right? 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.350
 a tip then is to improvise 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.030
 in that time interval between each riff 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.650
 You do anything here in the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.940
 try which way you train 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.820
 improvisation beauty 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.880
 another tip I'm going to give you is to do 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.770
 chromatism that this does not just need 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.539
 squeeze tonic you see finish a 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.850
 note to try tonic but you will not 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.180
 get stuck in it that you will do will 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.919
 do the following 1413 is peta tonic 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.740
 It's not that I came to you to make 1 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.660
 4123 o 3 is peta tonic even two it is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.430
 is not pentatonic of the tonic peta 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.830
 blues so what I'm going to do I'm going to put 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.560
 a note more here to give a feeling 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.810
 of blues a more chromatic sensation 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.370
 also ne 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:05.930
 I can do this on other strings in there 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.740
 lower 4 3 2 1 and finished in a 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.050
 catholic the catholic picture 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.449
 4 I finish 41 beauty I can not 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.490
 finish 1 2 or 3 does not have 2 and 3 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.830
 It is out of tonic peta she gets through 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.800
 The idea here is weird but the idea is 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.810
 you invent one based're chromaticism and 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.979
 always end up with a peta note 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.900
 tonic that is a god that I went through 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.250
 What are these notes? What are they? 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.250
 to do so chromatic right 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 uhuhuh 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.120
 We saw how there is now the possibility 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.820
 infinite you will not get stuck 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.590
 in that 14 43 did not have that whole thing 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.900
 do not go and invent a lot already 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.780
 Part for something not too much 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.389
 improvised with much more features 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.759
 Your will start to create something right. 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.130
 your stay be stopping copying 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.490
 other events i just event is impromptu 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.930
 that's cool too okay to do the following 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
 So, to make things nice, I'll go. 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.349
 stay at base 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.940
 You do the soil and I'm going to stay for a while. 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:35.210
 do at base you will do only one 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.210
 I get you okay 34 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.620
 So people, I hope you have 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.960
