00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 looking for a car to buy from 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.970
 umbra a wall while com.br 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.460
 the Brazilian arrives with little or no 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.830
 options that dispense with the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 clutch even unpopular that in a way 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
 in automated systems as a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 way to cut costs is volkswagen 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 offers the comfort of exchanges 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.619
 automatic 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 even the cheapest car on the line 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.269
 small and agile and economical the an intel 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.399
 to the troubled transit of large 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.739
 cities but what was left to be 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.600
 better the exchange that changed the gears 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.000
 alone to reduce stress 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000
 especially in congestion 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
 the solution found by the German factory 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.030
 was the staff for the year with the optional 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.399
 with the automated manual gearbox 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.469
 cheap than an automatic an idea 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.070
 cool but that did not stay there 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.899
 in it is that to keep costs down 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.750
 the factory has chosen the system 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.539
 actuators of the electromechanical type in the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.600
 place of hydraulicity like gm 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.090
 used in the meriva and gave up the car 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.130
 earned the nickname of that stride is that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.470
 both the clutch engagement and the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.500
 gearshift is made by engines 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.289
 electric as they are slow emerge leaps 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.520
 between one exchange and another 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.229
 including reductions 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.869
 and to complicate management 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.630
 electronic exchange sometimes does not know the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.730
 what to do in excess of a gear 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.720
 after starting an upload 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.420
 or if they're already ballad it takes so long 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.810
 to reduce it almost comes to a halt 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:53.270
 to engage the first the Greek situation 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.060
 which is also complicated because despite 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.790
 the three- engine 1.0 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.860
 cylinders is not perfect enough 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 to get the car out of this mess with 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.600
 some paulo mainly if the pib 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.030
 is loaded to make the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.120
 problem if you use the sequential mode 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 but then the system 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.490
 automated without mentioning that the operations 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.400
 also worsen in relation to the car with 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.770
 manual exchange has as consumption that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970
 still good but with that kind of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.470
 streaming 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.470
 should improve only on the local motion 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.470
 got worse 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.980
 the problem is the first relationships 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.170
 and electronic management 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.129
 that sometimes holds the marches without 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200
 need 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.319
 the engine spins high for a long time. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.480
 time and consumption is impaired 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.129
 the rest with the exception of the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.609
 instruments that show the marches 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.560
 gear lever and shift lever 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.769
 showed exactly the same as the others 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.139
 good material versions to rebates as well 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.299
 made and a young design leaves the 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:05.239
 pleasant interior, mainly in the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.250
 the most expensive version income and all 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.739
 options such as this one. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.049
 the suspension continues to 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.120
 little comfort because it raises some 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.709
 noises when the floor is not smooth 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.409
 but does well when the subject is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.810
 stability electric steering axle 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.299
 also performs the function correctly but 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.760
 here comes the question worth buying 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.069
 another with exchange the immochan between us 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.530
 I do not think so 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.209
 the car becomes annoying because of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.790
 of sttrans discomfort 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.680
 not to mention the stress of situations that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.739
 sometimes he puts the driver 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.949
 in this case nothing like good old exchange 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.949
 manual 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.299
 because it's not very cool, it's not 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.340
 but if you do not mind it do not 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.200
 wants to have the job of changing gears 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.569
 Can you buy a Volkswagen Rio? 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.269
 immochan from the version changes with 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.370
 two or four doors the cheapest 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.950
 moved two doors out for thirty-one 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.709
 one thousand three hundred and thirty reais the most expensive 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.299
 is the currency of immochan four ports per 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.430
 forty-three thousand four hundred and 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.010
 fifty and then with all the options 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.470
 passes the 45 thousand 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.840
 Let's go to the notes. 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.810
 newsletter starts with seven in performance 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.820
 rises to nine in consumption and there comes with O 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.760
 a series of eight in safety and 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.479
 inner space stability stability and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.289
 trunk closing with a reasonable 7 in 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.289
 cost benefit ratio
