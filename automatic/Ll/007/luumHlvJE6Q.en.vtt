00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 Put the sauce down. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.032
 Forgot to say that I didn't put the MSG into it 

00:00:51.032 --> 00:01:00.863
 Use vinegar 

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:05.238
 This is the Sui An. 

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:07.584
 Stir and then pour the eel again. 

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:13.375

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:23.172
 Put the vegetables into it. 

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:24.832

00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:27.972
 Only hot 

00:01:27.972 --> 00:01:30.082
 I had diarrhea That has been combed in time 

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:34.056
 After that, I didn't eat cold food at all. 

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:37.932
 Finished, put in the plate 

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:41.380
 You are really skilled. 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.422
 And then the important steps 

00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:46.863
 Fish eel slope 

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:48.702
 Eel slope here 

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.398
 Take a small fish that has already been made. Oh, so slope like this. 

00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:56.302
 Oh, so delicious to eat. 

00:01:56.302 --> 00:02:00.071
 Well, the fish eats. 

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:01.629

00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:07.578
 Come, Eel Rice 

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:08.678
 Not an eel rice 

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:11.901
 Familiar with eel rice 

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:24.606
 But this is a moment. I adjust the camera a little bit. 

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:26.286
 It is fried, noodles or sauces. 

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:28.948
 Then he will put eels like this 

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.078
 It is an eel that can be sliced ​​only for meat. 

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:33.651
 Not like our home Our house when eating 

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.864
 We will cut into pieces. Then spit out 

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:40.770
 He doesn't have a bone. He put it on top. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.440
 Then squeeze the lemon, add vitamin C a little 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.123
 Okay angle like this 

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.777
 Okay, the corner is ok. 

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:57.868
 Okay corner 

00:02:57.868 --> 00:03:13.526
 Look at me in the mirror Here 

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.611
 Similar to Pad Thai. 

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:17.969
 But he put a sui Then put the bean sprouts 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.105
 And don't have to put anything Put the eel down. 

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:25.270
 Thank you. Many of you are worried. 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.124
 Told me to eat carefully 

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.305
 Since he had disappeared Eat only hot food 

00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:35.588
 Don't worry And he also has vegetables 

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:37.942
 I don't know what vegetables are. 

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:41.234
 Fragrant, not the brittle leaves. 

00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:52.369
 Try it 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:04:00.032
 Strange taste, eel 

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:02.944
 Soft, spicy, sweet 

00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:23.273
 Cook 

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:28.870
 Ask if there is no water. 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.573
 I want to eat water. 

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:49.967
 He has soup. 

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:54.533
 It has a good flavor. 

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:58.817
 Here, he likes to eat here. 

00:04:58.817 --> 00:05:02.879
 Other tables that I eat 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.865
 He will eat almost all of this. 

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:10.564
 What vegetables do you know? 

00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:12.161
 Fried like this, don't put eggs. 

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:45.301
 Put only the line with bean sprouts. 

00:05:45.301 --> 00:06:12.208
 Eels have no fishy smell. 

00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:16.590
 Do good 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:54.882
 Chili goes a little. 

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:58.115
 People come to eat this store. 

00:06:58.115 --> 00:06:59.909
 As many people It's ten people. 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:06.258
 And there are both children And women too 

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.531
 This eel is the language that Vietnam is called fuzzy. 

00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:14.057
 Fade or slide around 

00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:16.807
 I recommend the principle of remembering that eels 

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:35.822
 The flow is scrolling. 

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:39.513
 Okay, keep your stomach to eat something else. 

00:07:39.513 --> 99:59:57.000
 Exciting travel
