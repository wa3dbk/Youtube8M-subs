way thinner than a feather case I mean
just<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> comparison<00:01:53.360> compared<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
just as a comparison compared to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.700

possibly the most the biggest iphone

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.670 
possibly the most the biggest iphone
case<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.570> otterbox<00:02:01.170> defender<00:02:01.259> and

case is that the otterbox defender and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.059 
case is that the otterbox defender and
you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> different

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you can see right there the different

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.320 
you can see right there the different
sized<00:02:09.890> Polly<00:02:10.890> stack<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> these<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.970> top<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sized Polly stack two of these on top of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.260 
sized Polly stack two of these on top of
each<00:02:12.390> other

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
each other

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.770 
each other
and<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:15.490> incredible<00:02:16.000> hufton<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.630> made

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and it's incredible hufton they made

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450 
and it's incredible hufton they made
this<00:02:16.870> case<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.710> thought<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.100> would<00:02:18.160> be<00:02:18.310> very

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
this case and I thought it would be very

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.000 
this case and I thought it would be very
fragile<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.210> easy<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.810> break<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.740> I've<00:02:20.860> been

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
fragile and easy to break but I've been

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.590 
fragile and easy to break but I've been

leave white marks on it because the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.670 
leave white marks on it because the
matte<00:04:31.240> finish<00:04:31.569> this<00:04:31.990> isn't<00:04:32.319> so<00:04:32.380> much<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.530> a

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
matte finish it feels different it's

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.740 
matte finish it feels different it's
because<00:04:36.430> Matt<00:04:36.639> leaves<00:04:36.910> like<00:04:37.060> fingerprints

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
because Matt leaves like fingerprints

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.309
