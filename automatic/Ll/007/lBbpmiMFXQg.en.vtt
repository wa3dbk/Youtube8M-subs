00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.510 
want to go off to your left and that's
the<00:01:58.630> wrong<00:01:58.780> way<00:01:58.989> because<00:01:59.829> it's<00:02:00.039> spawned<00:02:00.280> me<00:02:00.429> on

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
the wrong way because it's spawned me on

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.149 
the wrong way because it's spawned me on
the<00:02:00.640> different<00:02:00.969> side<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.299> I'm<00:02:01.390> used<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:01.630> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the different side that I'm used to it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.859 
the different side that I'm used to it
so<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.250> want<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.459> go<00:02:03.549> over<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:03.969> blue<00:02:04.479> side

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
so you want to go over to the blue side

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.869 
so you want to go over to the blue side
as<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.739> can<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:05.979> it's<00:02:06.099> like<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.219> bluer<00:02:06.520> color

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:06.879 
as you can see it's like a bluer color

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.550 
as you can see it's like a bluer color
you're<00:02:07.239> gonna<00:02:07.390> go<00:02:07.539> on<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.810> side<00:02:08.049> by<00:02:08.500> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
you're gonna go on this side by the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.250 
you're gonna go on this side by the
thing<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:08.950> right<00:02:09.069> up<00:02:09.190> here<00:02:09.329> in<00:02:10.329> like<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.929> top

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
thing and right up here in like the top

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
thing and right up here in like the top
will<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:12.430> last<00:02:12.609> call<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.209> can't

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
switch out and grab it so what you have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.000 
switch out and grab it so what you have
to<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.170> move<00:02:17.380> back<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.680> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
to do is you have to move back and you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.009 
to do is you have to move back and you
have<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.250> spawn<00:02:18.579> a<00:02:18.880> graph<00:02:19.269> lift<00:02:19.630> which<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
have to spawn a graph lift which I

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.240 
have to spawn a graph lift which I
already<00:02:20.109> did<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.620> why<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.799> picked<00:02:20.920> one<00:02:21.130> up

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
already did that's why I picked one up

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.680 
already did that's why I picked one up
but<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.150> spawned<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.569> graph<00:02:22.780> lift<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.880> you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
but I just spawned a graph lift and you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.400 
but I just spawned a graph lift and you
want<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.959> throw<00:02:26.139> it<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:27.250> corner<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.290> am

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
want to throw it in the corner but I am

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.830 
want to throw it in the corner but I am
a<00:02:29.440> failure<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.549> did<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.030> wrong<00:02:31.269> as<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.720> can

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
a failure so I did it wrong as you can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.979 
a failure so I did it wrong as you can
see<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.489> mess<00:02:33.639> up<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
want to get off the ground lift and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190 
want to get off the ground lift and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.620 
shoot it and then try to throw another
one<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.650> just<00:02:42.579> keep<00:02:42.730> spawning<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.359> if<00:02:43.510> you

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
one and just keep spawning them if you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.610 
one and just keep spawning them if you
keep<00:02:43.840> messing<00:02:43.989> up

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.450 

right<00:02:48.340> there

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.070 

but<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> want<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.390> throw<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.990> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
but you want to throw it like in the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
but you want to throw it like in the
corner<00:02:54.470> where<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.280> at<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.820> make<00:02:55.970> sure<00:02:56.060> it

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
corner where it's at and make sure it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.100 
corner where it's at and make sure it
doesn't<00:02:56.270> like<00:02:56.420> bounce<00:02:56.630> off<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> thing<00:02:57.080> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
doesn't like bounce off the thing and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.280 
doesn't like bounce off the thing and
then<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.830> fly<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:59.420> should<00:02:59.780> stir<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.260> up

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
then if you fly up it should stir you up

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.380 
then if you fly up it should stir you up
straight<00:03:01.130> up<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.490> have<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.910> look<00:03:02.030> up<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.360> air

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
straight up I have to look up in the air

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.720 
straight up I have to look up in the air
