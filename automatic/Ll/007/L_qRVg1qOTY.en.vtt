video is excuse me that I was wondering
what's<00:00:24.650> still<00:00:24.980> compatible<00:00:25.810> with<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.109> second

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
what's still compatible with the second

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.290 
what's still compatible with the second
gen<00:00:27.770> you<00:00:27.920> know<00:00:28.010> let<00:00:28.220> me<00:00:28.310> see<00:00:28.490> here<00:00:28.730> if<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.939> move

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
gen you know let me see here if I move

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.130 
gen you know let me see here if I move
into<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.840> darker<00:00:30.730> area<00:00:31.730> wow<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:32.599> that<00:00:32.930> looks

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
into a darker area wow that that looks

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.920 
into a darker area wow that that looks
worse<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:33.620> let<00:00:33.890> me<00:00:33.950> go<00:00:34.070> back<00:00:34.220> into<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.610> light

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
worse I let me go back into the light

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.080 
worse I let me go back into the light
like<00:00:35.930> what<00:00:36.290> apps<00:00:36.559> or<00:00:36.980> games<00:00:37.090> more

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
like what apps or games more

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.510 
like what apps or games more
specifically<00:00:38.630> would<00:00:38.719> still<00:00:38.930> be<00:00:39.020> compatible

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
specifically would still be compatible

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.729 
specifically would still be compatible
well<00:00:40.520> as<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.730> can<00:00:40.850> see<00:00:41.260> temple<00:00:42.260> runs<00:00:42.440> on<00:00:42.649> my

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
well as you can see temple runs on my

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.840 
well as you can see temple runs on my
whiskey<00:00:43.219> and<00:00:43.309> neon

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
whiskey and neon

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.369 
whiskey and neon
so<00:00:44.630> you<00:00:45.050> know<00:00:45.170> apps<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:46.550> can<00:00:46.730> no<00:00:46.879> longer

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
so you know apps that I can no longer

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.190 
so you know apps that I can no longer
seem<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.559> get<00:00:48.710> on<00:00:48.950> my<00:00:49.670> 2g<00:00:50.149> or<00:00:50.360> at<00:00:50.899> least<00:00:51.079> I

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
seem to get on my 2g or at least I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.170 
seem to get on my 2g or at least I
didn't<00:00:51.410> think<00:00:51.440> then<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:52.070> could<00:00:52.399> still<00:00:52.579> get<00:00:53.200> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
didn't think then I could still get so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.700 
didn't think then I could still get so
let's<00:00:56.180> see<00:00:56.450> here<00:00:56.539> let's<00:00:56.809> just<00:00:56.930> pick<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> real

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
devices to a point I mean obviously they

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.800 
devices to a point I mean obviously they
can't<00:02:20.410> force<00:02:21.410> app<00:02:21.680> developers<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.810> you'll

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
can't force app developers to you'll

can't force app developers to you'll
make<00:02:24.049> their<00:02:24.200> apps<00:02:24.410> like<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.280> they<00:02:25.400> still

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
make their apps like that but they still

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900 
make their apps like that but they still
offer<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.450> old<00:02:26.660> version<00:02:27.349> now<00:02:28.250> I'm<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.610> like

offer the old version now I'm just like
a<00:02:28.970> new<00:02:29.269> app<00:02:32.470> because<00:02:33.470> obviously<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.950> would

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
a new app because obviously this would

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.360

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
been around a little while but it's

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.510 
been around a little while but it's
compared<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:28.430> Facebook<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.380> very<00:03:30.380> new

and of course as you can see here the 2g

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.200 
and of course as you can see here the 2g
is<00:03:37.310> quite<00:03:37.580> slow<00:03:39.190> that's<00:03:40.190> as<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.550> be<00:03:40.640> expected

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
is quite slow that's as to be expected

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.020
