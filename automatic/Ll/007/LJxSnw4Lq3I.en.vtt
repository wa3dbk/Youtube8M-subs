00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
think that there needs to be more

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.070 
think that there needs to be more
connection<00:01:24.580> going<00:01:24.760> east-west<00:01:25.180> because<00:01:26.049> i

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
connection going east-west because i

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.570 
connection going east-west because i
think<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.350> have<00:01:26.380> Lafayette<00:01:26.920> Park<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.400> have

strengthening those connections and I
understand<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.780> bus<00:01:34.960> systems<00:01:35.290> already<00:01:35.530> do

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
understand that bus systems already do

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770 
understand that bus systems already do
run<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.190> those<00:01:36.310> places<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.450> perception

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780
