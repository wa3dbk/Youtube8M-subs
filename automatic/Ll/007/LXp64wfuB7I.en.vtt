00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.720
 good very good all kids here 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.009
 we are in a new video today I bring you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.499
 one of the first mod that have 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.920
 updated for minecraft 1.7 points 2 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.020
 well the mod is basically silly 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.600
 to say it somehow but good 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.330
 this mode is simulating the zoom 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.130
 what do we get when we have installed 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.869
 the optician when we press the letter 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 control when we have installed the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 crapped in hd as it does not zoom with the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.600
 that we can get to see then lengthen 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 long distance 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.590
 Well, we have what it does 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 simply pressing the control then we 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 will do a small zoom with which 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570
 we can see a small as a zoom 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 pretty big with which we can 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 get to see was a few meters more than 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.170
 they 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.390
 well this mode is to this zoom is not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 like eating loft and payne in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 'draft' ifai we could only zoom 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 without being used in any 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 tool there is nothing now with this zoom 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.670
 Well, we can while we're 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.030
 shooting for example with a bow if 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 we can do what is the zoom 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.520
 how are we going to eat some arrows 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.520
 to see 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.820
 well let's leave it in creative and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.290
 is how you see let's start 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.610
 shoot and we're going to press the key of the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 zoom and boys as you see then also the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.520
 stain 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.190
 and well, basically, it's these guys 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.080
 in this way it is not very useful if it is 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.510
 useful but it is a bullshit more than anything 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 but in the meantime he's taking out the optics 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.610
 in hd for this in the version then not 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.190
 we can go supporting with this one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.660
 with this little motel like the guys 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.350
 let's proceed to see the installation 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.570
 of the mod 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 Now I come good guys and we're 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.190
 return for the installation of football 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.690
 for minecraft 57.2 we are going to enter 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 the hero brain website as you know 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.770
 the one of the best pages in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.690
 download everything provides utilities 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.990
 this map bread structure to minecraft 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.880
 in its most updated versions 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.830
 after this precise spawn moment of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 some way let's go down here 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.330
 below and let's give it where they can 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 download now we click here and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.750
 if we were to download the world 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.340
 automatically once downloaded then 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 let's have it on the desktop as 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.090
 you see is a compressed file and now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.830
 let's go to this point folder 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.660
 minecraft for it we open run and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.630
 we wrote % app data percent 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.150
 let's point to minecraft let's go to the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.460
 folder version folder 1.7 point 2 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 we do it right click copy and the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.050
 we paste in the same folder we change 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.780
 We put the name of my name 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.060
 example 1.7 points 2 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 a mod and what are we going to do this 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.980
 name we copy it whole we are going to copy 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.740
 and now we open it and we change the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.230
 two names to these two files will 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.270
 we change to the name of the folder like this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
 that nothing we are going to change the name and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.670
 we paste the same name as not in the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.510
 folder and with this same one there is now 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.890
 the mod 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.290
 that is him 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.360
 the file that is named as 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.910
 extension session j we click right 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.510
 acquire with open with the pad of 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.010
 notes x to put in quotes 1.7 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.530
 points we paste the name before 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.450
 we close and save the changes once 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 done this we open the hard point file 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.700
 by right clicking and we open with 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.700
 save 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.060
 we eliminated the cain folder very 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 important this step 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.560
 and now we just open the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.420
 folder we open the compressed file 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.890
 and drag tumor was 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.680
 the point file 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.690
 there it is, I have already been perfectly 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.140
 You want to check it, well, we open 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 our brand 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.490
 and here we are going to create a new profile that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.030
 It is the d 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.490
 the tumor so let's go on active 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.620
 We put here what you want 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.710
 and here my investment as we select 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.160
 rallys 1.7 points juices or the name that 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.160
 we have put him 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.960
 6 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.510
 and already we have only guys that 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.640
 hit it on play and start playing with 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.920
 ours with this new mode that is more 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.720
 that nothing is a utility that as your 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.420
 own name indicates therefore quite useful 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.800
 to be able to orient evil in 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.660
 this world really not to say it of 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.010
