people that use dirt bikes and
four-wheelers<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.530> something<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
four-wheelers will use something like

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
four-wheelers will use something like
this<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.760> they'll<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> cam<00:01:02.399> buckle<00:01:02.789> tie

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this or they'll use the cam buckle tie

this or they'll use the cam buckle tie
down<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.110> number<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.339> taught

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
down the number for not which I taught

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.710 
down the number for not which I taught
last<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:07.020> example<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> there's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
last is an example of this so there's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.460 
last is an example of this so there's
that<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.700> cargo<00:01:12.659> hold<00:01:12.900> etc

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that it's a good one for cargo hold etc

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130 
that it's a good one for cargo hold etc
the<00:01:13.920> downside<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.869> hard

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the downside to this is that it's hard

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
the downside to this is that it's hard
on<00:01:16.259> your<00:01:16.439> rope<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.189> type<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.850> damaged<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
on your rope this type of not damaged is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
on your rope this type of not damaged is
it<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> untie<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.799> knot<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it the way to untie this knot is to you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.570 
it the way to untie this knot is to you
know<00:01:21.540> bind<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> itself<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.340> roll

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
know bind it on to itself and then roll

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
know bind it on to itself and then roll
it<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.000> nylon<00:01:24.570> rope<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it a nylon rope like this it's really

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.569 
it a nylon rope like this it's really
easy<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> nylons<00:01:27.540> hard<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
easy because the nylons hard and it is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.929 
easy because the nylons hard and it is
slippery<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> tie<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.939> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
slippery but if you tie that into you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.990 
slippery but if you tie that into you
know<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> hemp<00:01:33.509> rope<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:35.220> other<00:01:35.640> type<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
know a hemp rope or any other type of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
know a hemp rope or any other type of
fibrous<00:01:36.659> rope<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.590> very

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
fibrous rope it's going to be very

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
fibrous rope it's going to be very
difficult<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.490> remove<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.659> why<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.020> use

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
difficult to remove so that's why we use

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
difficult to remove so that's why we use
the<00:01:40.890> number<00:01:41.070> three<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:42.079> number<00:01:43.079> three<00:01:43.320> knot

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the number three not number three knot

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
the number three not number three knot
is<00:01:43.710> tied<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.430> you'll<00:01:44.700> quickly<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.210> why

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
is tied like this you'll quickly see why

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
is tied like this you'll quickly see why
I<00:01:45.630> call<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> number<00:01:46.680> three<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:48.030> lay

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I call it the number three not you lay

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
I call it the number three not you lay
the<00:01:48.329> rope<00:01:48.540> across<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:49.110> hand<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the rope across your hand like this and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
the rope across your hand like this and
then<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.850> wrap<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.450> till<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.930> have

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
then you wrap it around till you have

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.700 
then you wrap it around till you have
three<00:01:52.500> strands<00:01:53.119> there<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.500> take

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
three strands there you have it you take

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.490 
three strands there you have it you take
your<00:01:56.240> strand<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> last<00:01:58.170> one

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
your strand that it was the last one

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.069 
your strand that it was the last one
wrapped<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.189> because<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.450> slack<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
wrapped and because it has slack the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.410 
wrapped and because it has slack the
other<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.469> may<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.799> may<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> go

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
other one may or may not so you go

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.609 
other one may or may not so you go
underneath<00:02:03.840> three<00:02:04.290> times<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:06.619> it's

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
underneath three times you go one it's

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
underneath three times you go one it's
like<00:02:07.740> braiding<00:02:08.039> two<00:02:09.349> three<00:02:10.610> done<00:02:11.690> now<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> know

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
like braiding two three done now I know

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.850 
like braiding two three done now I know
that<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> fat

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that one kind of fat

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
that one kind of fat
but<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.520> same<00:02:14.880> loop<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but you get that same loop but the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.930 
but you get that same loop but the
advantage<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.890> look<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> angles

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
advantage to this is look at the angles

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.230 
advantage to this is look at the angles
that<00:02:18.090> are<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.310> easy<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
that are on this it's very very easy to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.530 
that are on this it's very very easy to
untie<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.950> pull<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.400> way<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
untie you pull this way and then that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.510 
untie you pull this way and then that
gives<00:02:24.720> way<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.350> gives<00:02:25.710> way<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.220> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
gives way to this gives way to that and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.250 
gives way to this gives way to that and
the<00:02:26.730> whole<00:02:26.910> thing<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.210> comes<00:02:27.600> apart<00:02:27.840> really

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the whole thing just comes apart really

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.590 
the whole thing just comes apart really
easily<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.520> pull<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> car<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
easily you can pull a car out of the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.770 
easily you can pull a car out of the
sand<00:02:30.990> out<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.560> mud<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.250> whatever

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
sand out of the mud out of whatever

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.140 
sand out of the mud out of whatever
using<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.900> type<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.200> technique<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.190> it'll

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
using this type of technique and it'll

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.630 
using this type of technique and it'll
still<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.690> easy<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.170> untie<00:02:37.260> I've<00:02:38.040> pulled<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
still be easy to untie I've pulled a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.130 
still be easy to untie I've pulled a
number<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.210> boats<00:02:39.780> houseboats<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.840> all

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
number of boats houseboats just all

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
number of boats houseboats just all
kinds<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.620> things<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.459> knot<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.060> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
kinds of things with this knot and you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.080 
kinds of things with this knot and you
know<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.290> always<00:02:46.530> been<00:02:46.830> really<00:02:47.040> good<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
know it's always been really good if you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.790 
know it's always been really good if you
need<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> loop<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> end<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.320> rope<00:02:49.530> it's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
need a loop in the end of a rope it's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.600 
need a loop in the end of a rope it's
easy<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.640> two<00:02:50.880> three<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:52.230> two

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
easy it's just one two three one two

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.150 
easy it's just one two three one two
three<00:02:53.610> BAM<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.810> got<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> loop<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.440> tie<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
three BAM you got a loop you tie on and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.340 
three BAM you got a loop you tie on and
you'd<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> pole<00:02:57.209> pole<00:02:57.450> pole<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.900> doesn't<00:02:58.200> matter

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
you'd a pole pole pole it doesn't matter

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.949 
you'd a pole pole pole it doesn't matter
it'll<00:02:58.620> come<00:02:58.830> undone<00:02:59.190> it<00:03:00.030> doesn't<00:03:00.360> destroy<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
it'll come undone it doesn't destroy the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.320 
it'll come undone it doesn't destroy the
rope<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.739> rock<00:03:01.980> climbing<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> figure

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
rope and rock climbing have a figure

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.860 
rope and rock climbing have a figure
eight<00:03:03.510> knot<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.500> tie<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.660> figure

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
eight knot that we tie and that figure

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.770 
eight knot that we tie and that figure
eight<00:03:07.110> knot<00:03:07.140> works<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.340> good<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:09.510> not

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
eight knot works really good for not

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
eight knot works really good for not
stressing<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.470> Rope<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.100> for<00:03:11.430> creating

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
stressing the Rope you know for creating

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.540 
stressing the Rope you know for creating
a<00:03:12.239> loop<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:13.020> use<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.860> large

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
a loop that you can use a large

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.729 
a loop that you can use a large
carabiner<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> lock<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.170> tidy<00:03:16.560> or

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
carabiner with a lock on the tidy or

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.000 
carabiner with a lock on the tidy or
harness<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:18.030> anyway<00:03:18.560> let's<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.709> over<00:03:19.920> this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
harness but anyway let's go over this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.430 
harness but anyway let's go over this
again<00:03:20.070> shall<00:03:20.580> we<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.330> one<00:03:21.570> two<00:03:22.940> three

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
again shall we so we go one two three

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.289 
again shall we so we go one two three
and<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.220> go<00:03:26.370> underneath<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:27.150> go

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
and then we go underneath we go

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.960 
and then we go underneath we go
underneath<00:03:27.780> once<00:03:29.660> underneath<00:03:30.660> twice

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
underneath once underneath twice

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.120 
underneath once underneath twice
underneath<00:03:32.970> three<00:03:33.750> times<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.530> number<00:03:37.709> three

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
underneath three times the number three

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.560 
underneath three times the number three
not<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.570> say<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:40.170> be<00:03:40.320> used<00:03:40.590> to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
not like I say this can be used to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.560 
not like I say this can be used to
create<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.900> sailor's<00:03:43.320> knot<00:03:43.560> or<00:03:44.040> cargo<00:03:44.370> not<00:03:44.700> I'm

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
create a sailor's knot or cargo not I'm

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.520 
create a sailor's knot or cargo not I'm
going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.840> bring<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.140> around<00:03:46.350> behind<00:03:46.769> my<00:03:46.920> leg

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
going to bring this around behind my leg

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.900 
going to bring this around behind my leg
pull<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.680> through<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:52.100> then<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:53.250> can<00:03:53.430> use<00:03:53.670> it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
pull it through and then you can use it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.300 
pull it through and then you can use it
to<00:03:54.090> cinch<00:03:54.390> it's<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:54.959> using<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.440> pulley<00:03:55.650> you

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
to cinch it's like using a pulley you

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.240 
to cinch it's like using a pulley you
can<00:03:56.489> get<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.670> really<00:03:57.180> really<00:03:57.570> tight<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
can get that really really tight and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.850 
can get that really really tight and
then<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.430> hold<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> at<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.120> point<00:04:00.620> this<00:04:01.620> with

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
then you hold it at this point this with

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.500 
then you hold it at this point this with
a<00:04:01.890> pinch<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.519> even<00:04:02.730> without<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.030> great<00:04:03.269> deal<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
a pinch and even without a great deal of

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.259 
a pinch and even without a great deal of
pressure<00:04:03.900> by<00:04:04.830> pinching<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.549> rope<00:04:05.730> over<00:04:05.910> but

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
pressure by pinching the rope over but

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.330 
pressure by pinching the rope over but
it<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:06.690> itself<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.380> frees<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:07.920> up<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.220> where

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
it on itself it frees it up to where

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.180 
it on itself it frees it up to where
it's<00:04:08.549> not<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.850> lot<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.150> weight<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:10.860> just<00:04:10.980> go

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
it's not a lot of weight and you just go

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.090 
it's not a lot of weight and you just go
underneath<00:04:11.549> your<00:04:11.820> leg<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:13.380> drop<00:04:13.709> forward

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
underneath your leg and drop forward

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.360 
underneath your leg and drop forward
like<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.600> oftentimes<00:04:15.600> all<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.650> know<00:04:16.769> hit<00:04:17.280> it

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
like that oftentimes all you know hit it

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.969 
like that oftentimes all you know hit it
like<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:18.019> sometimes<00:04:19.019> people<00:04:19.169> put<00:04:19.739> this

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
like that sometimes people put this

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.140 
like that sometimes people put this
through<00:04:20.220> here<00:04:22.430> sometimes<00:04:23.430> people<00:04:23.610> take<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
through here sometimes people take the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.670 
through here sometimes people take the
loop<00:04:24.390> for<00:04:24.840> added<00:04:25.169> security<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
loop for added security and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.310 
loop for added security and
you<00:04:27.639> know<00:04:27.759> draw<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.060> loop<00:04:28.389> down<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.169> it

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
you know draw the loop down on to it

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.810 
you know draw the loop down on to it
remember<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.800> pinch<00:04:30.070> point<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.639> how<00:04:30.759> that

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
remember that pinch point and how that

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.810 
remember that pinch point and how that
really<00:04:31.270> holds<00:04:31.449> so<00:04:31.750> well<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.370> can<00:04:33.400> do<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.580> lip

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
really holds so well so you can do a lip

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.730 
really holds so well so you can do a lip
not<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.300> way<00:04:34.509> in<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.110> loop<00:04:35.320> it's<00:04:35.530> not

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
not that way in the loop it's not

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.800 
not that way in the loop it's not
load-bearing<00:04:36.009> it's<00:04:36.669> just<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:37.060> secure<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.630> out

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
load-bearing it's just a secure it out

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.770 
load-bearing it's just a secure it out
of<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> way<00:04:38.199> so<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.740> will<00:04:38.949> be<00:04:38.979> easy<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.400> untie

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
of the way so it will be easy to untie

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.270 
of the way so it will be easy to untie
it's<00:04:40.780> not<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.320> loop<00:04:41.530> knots<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.039> sin

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
it's not that the loop knots the sin

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.670 
it's not that the loop knots the sin
it's<00:04:42.490> not<00:04:42.669> at<00:04:42.820> all<00:04:42.970> it's<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.080> when<00:04:44.289> you<00:04:44.380> find

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
it's not at all it's just when you find

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.920 
it's not at all it's just when you find
better<00:04:44.949> information<00:04:45.400> isn't<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.240> wise<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.449> use

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
better information isn't it wise to use

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.340 
better information isn't it wise to use
that<00:04:47.169> better<00:04:47.410> information<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:49.419> if<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.110> value

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
that better information and if you value

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.430 
that better information and if you value
rope<00:04:50.860> like<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.550> master<00:04:52.090> not<00:04:52.270> tire<00:04:52.570> like<00:04:53.139> Roy

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
rope like a master not tire like Roy

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.180 
rope like a master not tire like Roy
belinga<00:04:55.139> then<00:04:56.139> it's<00:04:56.320> good<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.680> take<00:04:56.919> care<00:04:57.130> of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
belinga then it's good to take care of

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.520 
belinga then it's good to take care of
