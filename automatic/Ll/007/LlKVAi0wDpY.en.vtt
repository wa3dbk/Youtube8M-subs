because<00:03:05.880> if<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.300> checks<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.140> really<00:03:07.380> wide<00:03:07.590> as

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
because if the checks are really wide as

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.310 
because if the checks are really wide as
a<00:03:08.010> north<00:03:08.310> american<00:03:08.430> american<00:03:09.420> heavies<00:03:09.690> so

side<00:03:10.560> scraping<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.070> an<00:03:11.250> option<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.820> it's<00:03:12.810> not

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
side scraping is an option but it's not

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.330 
side scraping is an option but it's not
that<00:03:13.170> easy<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.500> pull<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.860> off<00:03:13.950> because<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
that easy to pull it off because the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.860 
that easy to pull it off because the
side<00:03:14.520> armor<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.239> thin<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> have

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
side armor was really thin but you have

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.660 
side armor was really thin but you have
white<00:03:16.050> track<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.220> really

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
white track so you have to have really

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.300 
white track so you have to have really
slim<00:03:17.970> angles<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.860> done<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
slim angles but it can can be done and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.039 
slim angles but it can can be done and
it's<00:03:20.459> not<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.790> hard<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.239> look<00:03:21.420> at<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.720> look

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
it's not that hard and look at that look

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's not that hard and look at that look
at<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.549> circle<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.700> run<00:03:24.090> off<00:03:24.239> together<00:03:24.420> easy

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
at that circle is run off together easy

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.350 
at that circle is run off together easy
kill<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.380> t54<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.459> white<00:03:26.640> as<00:03:26.730> well<00:03:26.760> so

here like a KB one in tier seven but
everything<00:06:54.940> else<00:06:55.090> on<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.330> turd<00:06:55.690> is<00:06:55.810> exactly

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
everything else on the turd is exactly

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.930 
everything else on the turd is exactly
the<00:06:56.410> same<00:06:56.560> part<00:06:56.980> from<00:06:57.130> its<00:06:57.310> rearranged<00:06:57.700> and

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
the same part from its rearranged and

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.670 
the same part from its rearranged and
you'd<00:06:58.030> probably<00:06:58.240> get<00:06:58.540> a<00:06:58.570> look<00:06:58.750> but<00:06:59.230> less<00:06:59.500> hit

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
you'd probably get a look but less hit

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.530 
you'd probably get a look but less hit
points<00:06:59.980> and<00:07:00.130> slow<00:07:00.430> reload<00:07:00.790> but<00:07:01.000> you<00:07:01.300> want<00:07:01.480> to

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
points and slow reload but you want to

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.640 
points and slow reload but you want to
get<00:07:01.720> that<00:07:01.870> gun<00:07:02.050> first

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650

this gun is amazing and you want to get

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.810 
this gun is amazing and you want to get
it<00:07:05.290> before<00:07:05.410> everything<00:07:05.950> else<00:07:06.190> so<00:07:06.370> yeah

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
it before everything else so yeah

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.240 
it before everything else so yeah

torsion bars is a must as well so you

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.420 
torsion bars is a must as well so you
get<00:07:09.490> rid<00:07:10.000> of<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.710> so<00:07:11.710> you<00:07:11.770> can<00:07:11.980> get<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.220> gun<00:07:12.400> in
