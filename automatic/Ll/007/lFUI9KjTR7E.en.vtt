unmanned<00:01:27.369> our<00:01:27.549> model<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.600> idea<00:01:28.990> behind<00:01:29.140> it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
unmanned our model is the idea behind it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.529 
unmanned our model is the idea behind it
it's<00:01:29.710> one<00:01:29.950> step<00:01:30.219> per<00:01:30.460> user<00:01:30.670> basically<00:01:31.270> we

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
it's one step per user basically we

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.510 
it's one step per user basically we
create<00:01:31.899> once<00:01:32.170> them<00:01:32.439> will<00:01:32.709> been<00:01:32.890> designed<00:01:33.310> for

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
create once them will been designed for

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.940 
create once them will been designed for
a<00:01:33.579> user<00:01:33.759> where<00:01:34.569> no<00:01:34.780> other<00:01:34.810> user<00:01:35.350> will<00:01:35.619> have<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
a user where no other user will have the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.190 
a user where no other user will have the
same<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:36.729> can<00:01:36.909> easily<00:01:37.179> argue<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.869> he<00:01:38.020> have

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
same so we can easily argue that he have

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.309 
same so we can easily argue that he have
during<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:38.979> only<00:01:39.130> order<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:40.119> is<00:01:40.270> fine<00:01:40.479> but

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
during the only order that is fine but

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.069 
during the only order that is fine but
idea<00:01:41.649> behind<00:01:41.829> this<00:01:42.159> hookah<00:01:42.429> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.810> type<00:01:44.049> of

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
idea behind this hookah is the type of

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.039 
idea behind this hookah is the type of
artistic<00:01:44.890> work<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.549> engraving<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.539> copper<00:01:46.899> in

artistic work in engraving the copper in
it<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:48.009> usually<00:01:48.220> done<00:01:48.579> only<00:01:48.789> for<00:01:48.939> jewellery

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
it it's usually done only for jewellery

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.029 
it it's usually done only for jewellery
would<00:01:49.689> forego<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.319> is<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> first<00:01:50.770> time<00:01:51.009> for
