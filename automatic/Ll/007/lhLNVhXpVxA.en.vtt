00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.080
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.080
 886 task divided in three ways 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.210
 square with a side of 4 centimeters on 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.619
 four shares 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.609
 let's first draw a square with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.230
 side 4 centimeters best 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.230
 of course draw on the ticker 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:44.700
 so cost surrender below ah how 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:49.260
 uncomfortable so here too 4 draw first 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.010
 square with a side of 4 centimeters when 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 have painted 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 we think how we can divide it into 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 four equal parts the very first option 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.969
 which comes to mind is an option 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.659
 here is such a split in half 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:14.880
 horizontal line and split in half 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 vertical line nothing malika 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 uneven that is, we first painted 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 a square with a side of 4 centimeters then 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 look here two centimeters and here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.500
 two centimeters here 2 and here 2 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 tahirovna take the middle here and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.150
 in the middle here and with such lines 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 vertical horizontal divide by 4 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.229
 equal parts 4 parts which turned out 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 must be the same 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.500
 that was our first way let's the second 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.560
 the way 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.869
 on the line for a long time still by hand and draw with 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.869
 2 3 4 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.640
 what else could be a way to divide into 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.240
 four pieces let's take one 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.649
 side and divide it into four parts 1 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.280
 centimeter second centimeter 3 centimeter 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:19.310
 Well, it will be 4 centimeters that is possible by 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:21.260
 centimeters on each side here 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.079
 look we again took exactly the same 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.720
 square this square and this square they 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.590
 identical but only id we have divided into 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.959
 four equal parts of such lines 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.890
 on 4 squares on two centimeters with 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.849
 parties each 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:43.940
 and here we are divided into rectangles 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.160
 side one centimeter one side 1 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.440
 centimeter other 4 centimeters one 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.120
 centimeter 4 centimeters one centimeter 4 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.150
 centimeter one centimeter 4 cm 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.019
 ie here the four do not look 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.349
 on these 4 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.569
 but in this case we have 4 identical 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.120
 rectangle turned out and in this 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.480
 case, too, 4 identical squares 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.060
 could we do it anyhow 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:17.840
 divide the square into four equal parts 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.669
 let's try one-two-three-four from 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 hands it turns out not so smooth but 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.769
 quickly 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.260
 what else is there a way to divide the square 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.410
 into four equal parts but NATO 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.849
 for example such a method 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.099
 take from corner to corner diagonal 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.099
 line draw a diagonal is called 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.079
 here and here 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.920
 Look here, too, we had a square 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.600
 and here we divided it into 4 equal parts 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.630
 In fact, you can still in some way 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.570
 come up let's stop on 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.830
 asked what three options you can 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.830
 come up with actually of course others 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.180
 draw a quarter of a square and a half 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.660
 square well, then draw a quarter 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.380
 very easily we can either take this one 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:25.860
 part in and climbed to the little one either 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:29.010
 such part or such part, that is 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.680
 we have 4 options to choose from either here 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.080
 draw such a part now or here 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.520
 such a part 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.290
 either that part but the easiest thing 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.690
 the easiest way is necessary here is that part of the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:45.060
 draw two centimeters for two 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.870
 centimeters by two centimeters by two 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.890
 centimeter two centimeters is four 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.740
 cells here I had a full square and 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.450
 here and drew from him the fourth part 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.120
 I even can from the fourth figure of each 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.810
 part draw here we have one 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:12.660
 centimeter on 4 1 2 3 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:14.370
 does not fit 4 but so let it be I can 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.850
 even I draw separately from this part 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.250
 such 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.250
 I can draw a triangle 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:39.880
 that is, I can do any part 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.610
 draw here was a full square but here 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.490
 i drew one fourth part yet 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.590
 I was asked 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.790
 draw half a square to 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.690
 draw half a square you need to take 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.390
 first full square 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.500
 Well, I at least half allocate half of this 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:03.040
 2 4 parts that is this for example 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.770
 half of the square can we such figures 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.370
 draw of course we can take and 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.040
 something here draw her length 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.810
 there will be a width of 4 cells and a length of eight 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.990
 cell 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:25.140
 length width 4 cells and length 8 1 2 3 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:29.260
 so 8 so i drew a half square 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.180
 by the way here's half the way 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.010
 sweat then yes and here it is if u have half 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:38.230
 squares take half a square it's 2 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.840
 quarters and draw get the same 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.490
 a figure that is half of it 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.660
 square and half of this square 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.510
 look exactly the same but if 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.120
 we will want to draw half 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.190
 This square looks like it will be 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.550
 completely different half then two 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:05.950
 quarters so three quarters round 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:08.550
 now draw separately so hope them 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.550
 will not fit all 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.120
 But if you look at it half 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.080
 a square is half a square 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.650
 exactly the same but in this 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.070
 we got the same case 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.410
 a rectangle such well and when 4 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.480
 the squares inside will draw a 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.860
 retreat and not to merge figure 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.110
 me that's wrong here 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.760
 the place is not good that they are figures 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:44.730
 began to merge need to retreat of course 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.930
 I just didnâ€™t calculate that much 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.400
 everything seems to be the whole task 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.540
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My site 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.680
 all point dot ru 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.680
 bye everyone
