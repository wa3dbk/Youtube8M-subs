first<00:01:51.090> touch<00:01:51.390> screen<00:01:51.780> type<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> phone<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
first touch screen type of a phone that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
first touch screen type of a phone that
can<00:01:53.280> operate<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.909> only<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> say<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> one

can operate with only you say like one

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.350 
can operate with only you say like one
button<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.909> hadn't<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.270> had

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
button but it's they hadn't really had

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
button but it's they hadn't really had
anything<00:01:57.719> innovative<00:01:57.960> sense<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> lot<00:01:59.040> of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
people are kind of looking at the crazy

people are kind of looking at the crazy
weird<00:02:01.320> how<00:02:01.829> did<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.070> world<00:02:02.399> ideas<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.599 

all<00:02:21.019> righty<00:02:21.319> now<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.040> know<00:02:22.159> all<00:02:22.189> these

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
all righty now that we know all these

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.729 
all righty now that we know all these
concepts<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.299> just<00:02:23.329> ideas<00:02:23.659> and<00:02:24.379> some<00:02:24.560> may

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
concepts are just ideas and some may

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.830 
concepts are just ideas and some may
happen<00:02:25.159> some<00:02:25.370> never<00:02:25.549> will<00:02:25.819> let's<00:02:26.480> get<00:02:26.599> into

what<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.049> saw<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.319> beginning<00:02:27.439> of<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
what we saw at the beginning of the

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.459 
what we saw at the beginning of the
video<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.310> projector<00:02:29.060> now<00:02:29.749> the<00:02:30.139> way<00:02:30.260> this

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
video the projector now the way this

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.229 
video the projector now the way this
works<00:02:30.889> with<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.099> keyboard<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.849> through

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
works with the keyboard is through

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.780 
works with the keyboard is through
infrared<00:02:32.870> sensors<00:02:33.590> meaning<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:34.670> gonna

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
infrared sensors meaning you're gonna

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.699 
infrared sensors meaning you're gonna
project<00:02:34.969> the<00:02:35.269> keyboard<00:02:35.750> onto<00:02:36.109> a<00:02:36.139> flat<00:02:36.439> surface

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
project the keyboard onto a flat surface

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.670 
project the keyboard onto a flat surface
say<00:02:37.639> your<00:02:37.790> desk<00:02:38.090> or<00:02:38.389> a<00:02:38.420> table<00:02:38.719> just<00:02:39.200> swipe<00:02:39.439> them

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
say your desk or a table just swipe them

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.860 
say your desk or a table just swipe them
down<00:02:39.859> like<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.299> projectors<00:02:41.719> going

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
down like this and the projectors going

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.660 
down like this and the projectors going
to<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.019> an<00:02:42.170> infrared<00:02:42.469> thing<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.219> it's<00:02:43.549> gonna

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
to be an infrared thing so it's gonna

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.339 
to be an infrared thing so it's gonna
sense<00:02:44.090> where<00:02:44.480> your<00:02:44.599> finger<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.900> pushed<00:02:45.230> down

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
sense where your finger is pushed down

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.259 
sense where your finger is pushed down
and<00:02:45.799> through<00:02:46.099> infrared<00:02:46.430> technology<00:02:46.579> it'll

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
and through infrared technology it'll

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.509 
and through infrared technology it'll
tell<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.599> iPhone<00:02:48.049> which<00:02:48.769> keys<00:02:49.069> you're<00:02:49.280> trying

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
tell the iPhone which keys you're trying

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.580 
tell the iPhone which keys you're trying
to<00:02:49.609> press<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.359> that's<00:02:50.780> how<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.989> keyboard<00:02:51.530> is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to press and that's how the keyboard is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.860 
to press and that's how the keyboard is
gonna<00:02:51.739> work<00:02:52.010> however<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:52.969> don't<00:02:53.150> know<00:02:53.359> if<00:02:53.629> that

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
gonna work however I don't know if that

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.289 
gonna work however I don't know if that
is<00:02:54.079> gonna<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.799> true<00:02:55.219> or<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.819> think<00:02:55.969> this

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
is gonna be true or not I think this

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.939 
is gonna be true or not I think this
will<00:02:56.389> be<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.540> first<00:02:56.810> concept<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.349> see<00:02:57.709> with

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:57.949 
will be the first concept we see with

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.610 
will be the first concept we see with
the<00:02:58.040> iPhone<00:02:58.519> maybe<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:58.939> iPhone<00:02:59.180> 8<00:02:59.389> or<00:02:59.689> 10<00:02:59.930> but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the iPhone maybe the iPhone 8 or 10 but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.170 
the iPhone maybe the iPhone 8 or 10 but
I<00:03:00.650> don't<00:03:00.889> think<00:03:01.010> we'll<00:03:01.129> ever<00:03:01.159> see<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.609> projector

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
I don't think we'll ever see a projector

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.270 
I don't think we'll ever see a projector
like<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.019> one<00:03:03.199> here<00:03:03.469> where<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:03.949> just<00:03:04.159> goes

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
like this one here where it just goes

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280 
like this one here where it just goes
into<00:03:04.699> mid-air<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.629> doesn't<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:05.959> go<00:03:06.109> into

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
into mid-air it doesn't really go into

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.080 
into mid-air it doesn't really go into
anything<00:03:06.500> else<00:03:06.799> at<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.609> beginning<00:03:07.909> of<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
anything else at the beginning of the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.580 
anything else at the beginning of the
video<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.540> saw<00:03:08.750> how<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:08.959> projected<00:03:09.139> onto<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
video we saw how it projected onto the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.559 
video we saw how it projected onto the
wall<00:03:09.919> do<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:10.669> a<00:03:10.699> snow<00:03:11.150> leopard

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
wall do you like a snow leopard

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.720 
wall do you like a snow leopard
operating<00:03:12.169> system<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.709> think<00:03:13.189> this<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.430> doable

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
operating system I think this is doable

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.470 
operating system I think this is doable
once<00:03:14.209> we<00:03:14.329> get<00:03:14.419> into<00:03:14.599> iOS<00:03:15.049> 9<00:03:15.680> or<00:03:16.069> iOS<00:03:16.340> 10<00:03:16.760> but

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
once we get into iOS 9 or iOS 10 but

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.479 
once we get into iOS 9 or iOS 10 but
again<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.959> don't<00:03:18.019> see<00:03:18.169> these<00:03:18.439> being<00:03:18.709> true<00:03:19.459> or

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
again I don't see these being true or

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.399 
again I don't see these being true or
realistic<00:03:20.120> until<00:03:20.599> later<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.049> future

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
realistic until later on the future

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.649 
realistic until later on the future
however<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> iPhone<00:03:22.759> 6<00:03:23.060> does<00:03:23.269> have<00:03:23.449> a<00:03:23.509> lot<00:03:23.629> of

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
however the iPhone 6 does have a lot of

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.210 
however the iPhone 6 does have a lot of
hype<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.019> live<00:03:24.169> up<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.709> maybe<00:03:24.949> we'll<00:03:25.189> see

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
hype to live up to and maybe we'll see

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.770 
hype to live up to and maybe we'll see
some<00:03:25.489> concepts<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.120> none<00:03:26.299> of<00:03:26.329> us<00:03:26.479> have<00:03:26.659> even

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
some concepts that none of us have even

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.080 
some concepts that none of us have even
thought<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.229> yet<00:03:27.439> and<00:03:27.620> that's<00:03:28.040> what<00:03:28.489> keeps<00:03:28.879> us

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
thought of yet and that's what keeps us

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.550 
thought of yet and that's what keeps us
guessing<00:03:29.299> with<00:03:29.599> apples<00:03:29.989> because<00:03:30.229> they<00:03:30.349> never

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
guessing with apples because they never

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.409 
guessing with apples because they never
let<00:03:30.769> anything<00:03:31.040> leak<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.579> wait<00:03:32.060> until<00:03:32.299> my<00:03:32.389> next

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419
