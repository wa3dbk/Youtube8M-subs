last couple of years since I started
tying<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.340> version<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.970> along<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:10.019> a

tying this version of it along with a
basic<00:00:10.469> leads<00:00:10.710> pattern<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.910> couple<00:00:12.330> of

especially when we want a trophy hunt I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.710 
especially when we want a trophy hunt I
make<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.920> four<00:01:23.189> turns<00:01:23.759> we'll

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
make about three or four turns we'll

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
make about three or four turns we'll
stop<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:24.960> about<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.009> gonna

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
stop right about there and we're gonna

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.359 
stop right about there and we're gonna
put<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.820> second<00:01:27.479> wing<00:01:27.860> when<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> gets<00:01:29.130> wet

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
put in a second wing when it gets wet

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
put in a second wing when it gets wet
it's<00:01:29.549> gonna<00:01:29.670> streak<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's gonna streak down like that and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's gonna streak down like that and
it's<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> give<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> perfect

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it's going to give you the perfect

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's going to give you the perfect
silhouette<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.390> small<00:01:33.659> baitfish

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
silhouette of a small baitfish

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
silhouette of a small baitfish
so<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:35.009> basically<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.670> we're<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:35.850> try

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
so that's basically what we're gonna try

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640 
so that's basically what we're gonna try
to<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.659> particular<00:01:36.900> pattern<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to do with this particular pattern and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.140 
to do with this particular pattern and
we'll<00:01:37.740> talk<00:01:37.979> about<00:01:38.159> retrieves<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> lines

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we'll talk about retrieves and lines

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.179 
we'll talk about retrieves and lines
that<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:40.020> best<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.070> on

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that are best for it when we get out on

that are best for it when we get out on

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the water with us fly so you can see how

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
the water with us fly so you can see how
we<00:01:42.869> fished<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:44.100> rule<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> thumb<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
we fished a good rule of thumb the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.660 
we fished a good rule of thumb the
deeper<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:46.200> slower<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.189> higher<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
deeper you go go slower the higher you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
deeper you go go slower the higher you
fish<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> cheat<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> little

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
fish you can cheat and go a little

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
fish you can cheat and go a little
faster<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.829> has<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> hand

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
faster and that has to do with a hand

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.370 
faster and that has to do with a hand

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
twist to retrieve whether you're doing a

fast hand twist or you doing a slow hand
twist<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.470> both<00:01:55.890> cases<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.939> you'll<00:01:57.149> find

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
twist in both cases but you'll find

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.850 
twist in both cases but you'll find
those<00:01:57.600> retrieves<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> those<00:01:58.409> lines<00:01:58.680> will

those retrieves and those lines will
work<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.219> consistent<00:01:59.790> with<00:01:59.850> both<00:02:00.030> those
