00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello today again a video from 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.200
 I have a very simple one 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.830
 model casserole but my friend and me 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.630
 we like him very much 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.769
 relatively often 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.570
 and yes i thought i'll show you 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.980
 Especially now really super easy though 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 delicious as we find 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.369
 you need noodles keep such a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.800
 casserole then a little cheese so 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.900
 cheese slices now ham 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.080
 I always get a slice like that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 and cut the dice and an egg 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 and a little salt and that was it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 already and then we go and we 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.670
 The noodles come in saltwater give 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.070
 if only then cooked 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.140
 just put everything in the story 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:00.800
 Casserole usually makes three 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.800
 So first moodle layers then sink 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 and then cheese and the whole of it again 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.550
 in front and that will come soon 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 In between I have pepper with salt 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.670
 spiced up and you can do that one more 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:41.540
 stretch a bit with milk or cream 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:41.540
 or a bit of milk here 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:02:16.140
 well and then pour over it again 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:18.060
 ham cheese and then the last 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.319
 Just layer it again and we will 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.319
 complete with cheese 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.190
 The whole easy for 25 to 30 minutes 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 in the oven and then it's great 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.580
 easy
