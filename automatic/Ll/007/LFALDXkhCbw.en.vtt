ice<00:00:01.280> 587<00:00:02.570> got<00:00:03.570> another<00:00:03.870> solar<00:00:04.230> project<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
ice 587 got another solar project on the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.889 
ice 587 got another solar project on the
go<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.310> thought<00:00:05.549> I'd<00:00:05.670> just<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.029> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.600> all

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
go so I thought I'd just to show you all

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.379 
go so I thought I'd just to show you all
now<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:07.830> not<00:00:07.950> finished<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
now it's not finished but going to be a

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.850 
now it's not finished but going to be a
bit<00:00:09.570> impatient<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.260> put<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.500> video<00:00:10.650> up

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
bit impatient and put this video up

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.330 
bit impatient and put this video up
anyway<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:12.509> I've<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:13.340> 20

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
anyway and so what I've got is my 20

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
anyway and so what I've got is my 20

that's connected to my solar setup via
this<00:00:19.020> cigarette<00:00:19.350> lighter<00:00:19.590> socket<00:00:19.680> which

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
this cigarette lighter socket which

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.310 
this cigarette lighter socket which
currently<00:00:20.730> comes<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> back<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.570> will

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
currently comes out the back here will

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
currently comes out the back here will
be<00:00:22.470> connected<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.029> draw<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.269> hole

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
be connected here when I draw the hole

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
be connected here when I draw the hole
and<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> shelf<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and then I'm going to put a shelf in the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.910 
and then I'm going to put a shelf in the
top<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.599> fit<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.900> inverter<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.830> all

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
top to fit an inverter so when it's all

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
top to fit an inverter so when it's all
closed<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.429> everything's<00:00:30.300> nice<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.510> neatly

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
closed in everything's nice and neatly

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
closed in everything's nice and neatly
inside<00:00:31.019> I've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:32.040> three<00:00:32.369> 12-volt<00:00:33.030> batteries

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
inside I've got three 12-volt batteries

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.620 
inside I've got three 12-volt batteries
in<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> bottom<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.920> charge<00:00:35.190> controller

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
in the bottom and my charge controller

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.020 
in the bottom and my charge controller
looks<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> scramble<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> wire<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.730> does

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
looks a scramble of wire but it does

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.400 
looks a scramble of wire but it does
will<00:00:39.180> make<00:00:39.329> sense<00:00:39.629> I'll<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.110> show<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
will make sense I'll just show you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.569 
will make sense I'll just show you
around<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> front<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.430> both

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
around the front and then you can both

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.090 
around the front and then you can both
see<00:00:41.820> ball<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> scrambled<00:00:42.899> wire<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
see ball that scrambled wire is on the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
see ball that scrambled wire is on the
front<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.489> I've<00:00:44.610> got<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:45.469> side<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.649> bolts

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
front here I've got my side of bolts

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.910 
front here I've got my side of bolts
like<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.960> basically<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.410> turn<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.710> on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
like in so basically if I turn that on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.209 
like in so basically if I turn that on
I'm<00:00:50.160> getting<00:00:50.910> 13<00:00:51.600> volts<00:00:51.960> directly<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I'm getting 13 volts directly from the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
I'm getting 13 volts directly from the
solar<00:00:53.430> panel<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> Sun<00:00:54.390> itself<00:00:54.719> not

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
solar panel so from the Sun itself not

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.130 
solar panel so from the Sun itself not
by<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> batteries<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.640> getting<00:00:57.210> 13<00:00:57.539> volts<00:00:57.870> so

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
by the batteries I'm getting 13 volts so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.959 
by the batteries I'm getting 13 volts so
I<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.920> adjust<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.910> angle

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
I can adjust my angle

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.270 
I can adjust my angle
best<00:01:02.359> lot<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.629> voltage<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.230> that's<00:01:04.100> where

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
best lot of voltage and that's where

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.920 
best lot of voltage and that's where
that<00:01:04.400> comes<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.760> handy<00:01:04.909> otherwise<00:01:05.420> that's<00:01:05.720> not

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
that comes in handy otherwise that's not

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
that comes in handy otherwise that's not
really<00:01:06.259> needed

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 

battery<00:01:09.570> volts<00:01:09.870> so<00:01:10.500> twelve<00:01:10.860> point<00:01:11.130> nine<00:01:11.310> volts

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
battery volts so twelve point nine volts

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.990 
battery volts so twelve point nine volts
not<00:01:12.270> too<00:01:12.450> bad

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.450 

obviously<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.960> bear<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.469> you<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
obviously could be bear but you know it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
obviously could be bear but you know it
will<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:19.020> I've<00:01:19.140> got<00:01:19.259> two<00:01:19.439> sockets

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
will do and then I've got two sockets

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.170 
will do and then I've got two sockets
here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

one's not connected up at the moment has

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
one's not connected up at the moment has
only<00:01:25.229> fitted<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> yesterday<00:01:26.299> but<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
only fitted it yesterday but it will be

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.230 
only fitted it yesterday but it will be
connected<00:01:28.200> directly<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> batteries

please part here and so if I was to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
please part here and so if I was to
disconnect<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> batteries<00:01:42.539> I'd<00:01:42.750> still<00:01:43.319> have

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
disconnect the batteries I'd still have

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
disconnect the batteries I'd still have

that were built into the tower already

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.039 
that were built into the tower already
I've<00:01:53.920> managed<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.460> connect<00:01:54.820> them

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.120 

byah<00:01:59.759> I've<00:02:00.759> connected<00:02:01.060> them<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.479> another<00:02:02.130> USB

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
byah I've connected them to another USB

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.399 
byah I've connected them to another USB
so<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.909> USB<00:02:04.359> socket<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:04.990> then<00:02:05.109> into<00:02:05.320> this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
so is the USB socket and then into this

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.899 
so is the USB socket and then into this
cigarette<00:02:05.829> lighter<00:02:06.009> socket<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> make

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
cigarette lighter socket just to make

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.540 
cigarette lighter socket just to make
sure<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.410> converts<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> power<00:02:09.340> from

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
sure that it converts the power from

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.120 
sure that it converts the power from
batteries<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.360> 12<00:02:10.959> volts

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
batteries to 12 volts

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.760 
batteries to 12 volts
that's<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.030> there<00:02:14.300> I'm<00:02:15.020> not<00:02:15.290> sure<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that's the in there I'm not sure if that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.070 
that's the in there I'm not sure if that
would<00:02:15.890> convey<00:02:16.280> from<00:02:16.730> 12<00:02:17.030> volts<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> 5<00:02:17.750> volts

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
would convey from 12 volts to 5 volts

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.760 
would convey from 12 volts to 5 volts
but<00:02:19.270> I've<00:02:20.270> tried<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:20.960> this<00:02:21.110> out<00:02:21.380> there

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
but I've tried it with this out there

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.920 
but I've tried it with this out there
and<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.430> works<00:02:22.640> that's<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:23.390> connected<00:02:23.810> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and that works that's not connected to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.240 
and that works that's not connected to
the<00:02:24.020> ratchet<00:02:24.380> yet<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.680> don't<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.190> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the ratchet yet so don't actually have a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.610 
the ratchet yet so don't actually have a
switch<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> front<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:27.050> once<00:02:27.410> I've<00:02:27.530> added

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
switch in the front but once I've added

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.410 
switch in the front but once I've added
the<00:02:27.860> switch<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.850> will<00:02:28.970> work<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.390> well

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
the switch then that will work as well

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.590 
the switch then that will work as well
so<00:02:30.460> rather<00:02:31.460> than<00:02:31.610> me<00:02:31.760> having<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.030> constantly

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
so rather than me having to constantly

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.940 
so rather than me having to constantly
use<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.200> thing<00:02:33.440> all<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> time

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
use this thing all the time

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.670 
use this thing all the time
plugging<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.030> here<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:38.600> know<00:02:38.780> switch<00:02:39.530> it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
plugging it in here you know switch it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.610 
plugging it in here you know switch it
on<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.880> think<00:02:41.090> see<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.420> there<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.750> power<00:02:41.960> um

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.170 

yeah<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> bit<00:02:46.490> more<00:02:46.520> convenience

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
yeah so it's a bit more convenience

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.640 
yeah so it's a bit more convenience
really<00:02:47.510> rather<00:02:47.660> than<00:02:47.870> having<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.170> keep<00:02:48.320> that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
really rather than having to keep that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
really rather than having to keep that
all<00:02:48.770> around<00:02:49.060> I'm<00:02:50.060> possibly<00:02:51.050> planning<00:02:51.470> on

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
all around I'm possibly planning on

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.290 
all around I'm possibly planning on
using<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.640> off<00:02:52.670> switches<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.210> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
using the on and off switches on the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.430 
using the on and off switches on the
front<00:02:54.550> for<00:02:55.550> an<00:02:56.090> entire<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.200> for<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
front for an entire on and off for the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.580 
front for an entire on and off for the
whole<00:02:57.650> system<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.340> maybe<00:02:59.150> attaching<00:02:59.930> these

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
whole system and maybe attaching these

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.470 
whole system and maybe attaching these
they're<00:03:01.580> not<00:03:01.700> actually<00:03:02.000> connected<00:03:02.240> up

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
they're not actually connected up

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.420 
they're not actually connected up
amounts<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:02.930> reflection<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.710> light<00:03:03.890> but

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
amounts just reflection of the light but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.130 
amounts just reflection of the light but
these<00:03:04.610> I'm<00:03:04.940> possibly<00:03:05.630> thinking<00:03:05.960> of

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
these I'm possibly thinking of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.210 
these I'm possibly thinking of
connecting<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:08.470> probably<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> charge<00:03:09.860> light

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
connecting to probably the charge light

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.810 
connecting to probably the charge light
and<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:11.210> battery<00:03:11.750> full<00:03:12.020> light<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.700> front

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
and the battery full light on the front

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.520 
and the battery full light on the front
but<00:03:14.360> I'm<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.810> too<00:03:15.020> sure<00:03:15.050> where<00:03:15.320> they<00:03:15.440> were

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
but I'm not too sure where they were

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.600 
but I'm not too sure where they were
actually<00:03:15.770> going<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:15.920> do<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.220> yeah<00:03:16.340> or<00:03:16.460> not

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
actually going to do that yeah or not

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.430 
actually going to do that yeah or not
but<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.820> know<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:20.690> all<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> work<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.140> progress

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
but you know it's all a work in progress

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.530 
but you know it's all a work in progress
and<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.760> first<00:03:22.910> video<00:03:23.120> and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
and this is just the first video and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.930 
and this is just the first video and
once<00:03:24.530> I've<00:03:24.710> updated<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.220> completely<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.760> will

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
once I've updated it completely I will

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.240 
once I've updated it completely I will
oh<00:03:27.370> let<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.460> guys<00:03:28.640> have<00:03:28.910> another<00:03:29.120> video<00:03:30.250> there

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
oh let you guys have another video there

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.790 
oh let you guys have another video there
is<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.400> fan<00:03:31.670> here<00:03:31.910> as<00:03:32.000> well<00:03:32.180> by<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.510> way<00:03:32.800> which

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
is a fan here as well by the way which

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.220 
is a fan here as well by the way which
obviously<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:34.340> there

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.809 

that's<00:03:38.230> my<00:03:38.470> knee<00:03:38.530> therefore<00:03:39.129> when<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.310> connect

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
that's my knee therefore when I connect

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.350 
that's my knee therefore when I connect
the<00:03:40.140> inverter<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.769> when<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.730> decide<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.180> put<00:03:43.299> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
the inverter in when I decide to put the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.910 
the inverter in when I decide to put the
vote<00:03:43.510> inverter<00:03:44.049> in<00:03:44.290> because<00:03:44.590> obviously<00:03:44.680> it's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
vote inverter in because obviously it's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.190 
vote inverter in because obviously it's
going<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.370> side<00:03:45.989> excuse<00:03:46.989> me<00:03:47.170> a

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
going to have the side excuse me a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.850 
going to have the side excuse me a
second

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
second

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.600 
second
seal<00:03:48.340> back<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.420> side<00:03:49.689> obviously<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.610> it's

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
seal back on the side obviously and it's

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.910 
seal back on the side obviously and it's
going<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.879> enclosed<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.739> keep

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
going to be enclosed so just to keep

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.020 
going to be enclosed so just to keep
everything<00:03:54.190> nice<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> cool<00:03:55.290> I'll<00:03:56.290> keep<00:03:56.530> her

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
everything nice and cool I'll keep her

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.759 
everything nice and cool I'll keep her
keep<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.060> fan<00:03:58.390> in<00:03:58.690> there<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.500> turn<00:03:59.650> it

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
keep the fan in there and I can turn it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.399 
keep the fan in there and I can turn it
on<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.159> off<00:04:00.250> as<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.849> when<00:04:00.940> needed<00:04:01.140> this<00:04:02.140> wire
