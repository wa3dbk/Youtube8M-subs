to be going over what DSR technology is
or<00:00:15.480> Dynamics<00:00:16.020> super-resolution<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:17.609> you

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760

without actually buying a 4k monitor and
I<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.669> tried<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> tell

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
supported graphics cards but you know

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.219 
supported graphics cards but you know
there's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> pretty<00:01:12.540> wide<00:01:12.750> variety<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there's a pretty wide variety of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
there's a pretty wide variety of
graphics<00:01:13.770> cards<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.909> couple

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
graphics cards that you can use a couple

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
graphics cards that you can use a couple
pages<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.530> any<00:01:16.710> these

pages here so if you have any these

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
pages here so if you have any these
graphics<00:01:17.400> cards<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> can

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
graphics cards you're good to go you can

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.289 
graphics cards you're good to go you can
use<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.430> doesn't<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.060> away

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
use this and it really doesn't take away

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.580 
use this and it really doesn't take away
performance<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.560> you're

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
performance when you're when you're

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
performance when you're when you're
gaming<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.100> anything<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> maybe

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
gaming or anything like that and maybe

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.289 
gaming or anything like that and maybe
takes<00:01:24.420> away<00:01:24.689> 5<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.860> 10<00:01:26.100> frames<00:01:26.640> per<00:01:26.790> second

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
takes away 5 to 10 frames per second

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
takes away 5 to 10 frames per second
which<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.900> noticed<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.400> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
which is what I have noticed but it is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
which is what I have noticed but it is
well<00:01:29.850> worth<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.070> playing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
well worth it you know because I playing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.120 
well worth it you know because I playing

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.359 
you know maybe I was getting in about 50
and<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.549> spiking<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.119> 45<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.619> there's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and I was spiking at 45 but there's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.770 
and I was spiking at 45 but there's
really<00:01:44.579> no<00:01:44.820> difference<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> can't<00:01:45.570> tell<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
really no difference I can't tell the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
really no difference I can't tell the
difference<00:01:45.810> between<00:01:46.140> 45<00:01:46.740> fps<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.250> 60<00:01:47.700> fps<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
difference between 45 fps and 60 fps I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
difference between 45 fps and 60 fps I
don't<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.869> either<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
don't know if you can either but it is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
don't know if you can either but it is
definitely<00:01:50.549> worth<00:01:50.840> turning<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> maybe

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
definitely worth turning on and maybe

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
definitely worth turning on and maybe
checking<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.189> you've<00:01:53.340> never<00:01:53.490> seen<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> 4k

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
checking out if you've never seen a 4k

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
checking out if you've never seen a 4k
screen<00:01:54.509> before<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> would<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you don't want to spend like five

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
you don't want to spend like five

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
want to turn it on four times or you can

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.780 
want to turn it on four times or you can
even<00:02:35.560> turn<00:02:35.740> around<00:02:36.040> two<00:02:36.130> times<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.550> double

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
even turn around two times to double

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.640 
even turn around two times to double
your<00:02:36.940> resolution<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.080> have<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.410> four

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
your resolution but I have it on four

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890 
your resolution but I have it on four
times<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.910> know<00:02:40.030> four<00:02:40.720> times

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
times because it's you know four times

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.960 
times because it's you know four times
1080p<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.890> what<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.400> four<00:02:42.730> times<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
1080p is what it is four times the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.760 
1080p is what it is four times the
native<00:02:43.240> resolution<00:02:43.410> because<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.470> wanted<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
native resolution because I wanted the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.740 
native resolution because I wanted the
best<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> best<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.060> turn<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
best of the best so you turn it on and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
best of the best so you turn it on and
you<00:02:47.260> also<00:02:47.290> get<00:02:47.650> an<00:02:47.770> option<00:02:48.220> here<00:02:48.400> DSR

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
you also get an option here DSR

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.650 
you also get an option here DSR
smoothness<00:02:49.480> pretty<00:02:50.230> much<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:52.150> how

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
smoothness pretty much this is just how

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620 
smoothness pretty much this is just how
smooth<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.650> edges<00:02:53.800> are<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.239> can<00:02:55.510> kind

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
smooth the edges are what you can kind

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870 
smooth the edges are what you can kind
of<00:02:55.720> think<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:56.050> DSR<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:56.920> kind<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.520> like<00:02:57.670> an

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
of think of DSR is kind of like an

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.300 
of think of DSR is kind of like an
videos<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:58.570> version<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.310> anti-aliasing

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
videos like version of anti-aliasing

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.780 
videos like version of anti-aliasing
maybe<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:03.250> makes<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> image

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
maybe it just really makes the image

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.150 
maybe it just really makes the image
sharper<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.450> moves<00:03:04.660> removes<00:03:05.560> all<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
sharper and it moves removes all the the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.070 
sharper and it moves removes all the the
jaggies<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.580> believe<00:03:07.060> there's<00:03:07.270> like<00:03:07.510> some<00:03:08.050> sort

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
jaggies I believe there's like some sort

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080 
jaggies I believe there's like some sort
of<00:03:08.320> like<00:03:08.500> pictures<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> grass<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.640> darksouls

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
of like pictures of grass and darksouls

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.270

it<00:03:16.209> does<00:03:16.959> work<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.380> does<00:03:17.410> work<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.850> all<00:03:18.970> I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it does work it does work but so all I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.729 
it does work it does work but so all I
have<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.480> turn<00:03:19.660> that<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.470> think

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
have to do is turn that on and I think

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.009 
have to do is turn that on and I think
there<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.100> button<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.450> that

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
there is a button that like that that

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.500 
there is a button that like that that
appears<00:03:23.860> down<00:03:24.100> here<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.430> says<00:03:24.489> apply<00:03:25.269> or

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
appears down here that says apply or

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.490 
appears down here that says apply or
something<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.900> don't<00:03:26.019> know<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.230> make<00:03:26.350> sure

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
you hit that I'll go ahead and turn it

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.259
