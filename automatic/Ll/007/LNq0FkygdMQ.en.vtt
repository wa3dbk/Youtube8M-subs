Hey BassResource Fans.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.370
Mike Iaconelli here.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.300
Welcome to a brand new edition of Ike's Bass
Class.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.690
We're here today to talk about a brand new
rig sweeping the country right now called

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.440
the Alabama rig.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.010
And of course it's not one of these new techniques.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.130
It's actually an old technique that's come
back around like most of these techniques

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.130
that we're talking about.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.740
But I've got to be honest with you, when I
kind of first heard the rumors of this thing

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.900
it threw me off guard a little bit.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.620
Because in reality when we say Alabama rig
what we're really talking about for all the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.960
salt water guys is we're talking about an
umbrella rig, you know?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.370
And an umbrella rig is something that guys
use in salt water and on the East Coast where

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.100
I'm from we've used for stripers for a lot
of years.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.619
And it's funny because it defies a lot of
the rules of what traditional bass fishing

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.619
is.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.189
Or what we think about in traditional bass
fishing with artificials.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:27.530
So for years we've been taught to imitate
the forage to a T and to use line that's invisible

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.529
and to really hone in on the exact size and
shape, and to get rid of you know a lot of

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.709
the terminal stuff.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:40.159
That's kind of been embedded in my mind in
bass fishing, especially in clearer water.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.439
And then you see a contraption like the Alabama
rig, which is essentially kind of, it looks

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.549
like a crab trap with a bunch of baits hanging
from it.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.179
And you kind of scratch your head.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.179
But in saying all that, I think we need to
look at the bigger picture for what we're

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.569
seeing about this technique.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.539
And you can learn something bigger from this
then just the technique itself.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:16.110
Which is that when you show the fish something
that is so different and so unique, especially

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.620
in places where there's a lot of pressure.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.290
Heavily pressured situations.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.090
Then a lot of times you have success.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.019
And so I think that's the bigger moral of
this picture.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.750
So we'll talk a little bit about the rig and
then I think we'll shift over to talking about

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.319
this theory of presenting new baits and new
actions to the fish to make them bite.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:50.661
So, again, the umbrella rig and its pure essence,
the Alabama rig, is basically your line, your

00:02:50.661 --> 00:03:02.260
main line to a weight and then off of that
weight is just basically a four or five wire

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.579
leaders that keep a snap swivel spread at
an even distance apart.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.980
And on these snaps you can pretty much place
anything you want.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.170
Right now the hot baits for this Alabama rig
are things like swim bait, the Berkley Hollow

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.079
Belly swim bait in both sizes, the big size
and the little size, on a jig head.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:35.980
Things like fluke style baits, scrounger heads,
spinnerbaits.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.579
I've even seen some e-mails come through already
where guys are rigging jigs, brush hogs, shaky

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.579
heads.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.540
I even had one talk about using frogs on the
Alabama rig, so, I think the bait choice can

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.969
be anything.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:59.379
But the theory of this now, especially with,
if you can imagine these five swim baits coming

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.209
through, is to imitate a school of fish, to
imitate an actual school of bait fish coming

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.209
by.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.659
And that's really the key to this Alabama
rig or an umbrella rig is you're imitating

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.549
something that happens really naturally in
an environment.

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.030
We've all been out there at one time or another
and have looked down in the water and have

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.890
seen a school of shad or alewife or perch
or whatever it is, swim by.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.960
And you can see how they kind of swim in unison.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.690
And this rig does a great job of imitating
that school.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.490
So in its essence that's what the Alabama
rig is.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.180
It's a spreader, a lot of options on what
you can put on the back.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.360
You're basically fishing this rig on heavy
line, believe it or not, even in clear water.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.740
You're fishing it on 65 or 80 pound braid.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.630
And you're fishing it on a rod with a little
bit of tip.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.420
And that throws some people off too.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.260
When I first heard about it I thought for
sure you were throwing it on an eight foot

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.510
broomstick or something like that.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.410
But you're actually fishing it on the same
kind of rod you'd fish a swim bait or a frog

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.410
on.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.110
So it's a 7, 7 and a half foot rod with a
little bit of tip.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.760
So more of a medium heavy action rod.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.880
And action wise, depending on the baits you
can do a lot of things with the retrieve.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.090
But in general you're basically retrieving
it a lot like a swim bait.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.980
You're making those baits act like a school,
and come through the water column in a motion

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.160
that an actual school of fish would.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.250
So, that's the Alabama rig.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.940
And I know a lot of you out there are doing
the same thing I did when I heard about it,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.620
which is you're shaking your head like, they
can't be catching them on this thing.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.620
But they are.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.160
And that brings us to our second point of
this conversation which is the bigger picture.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.880
Which is the Alabama rig is presenting something
that the fish don't see.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.280
You know, so right now as we're taping this
interview you've got a Lake Guntersville FLW

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.970
Tournament going on and the leader is dominating
using Alabama rig.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.340
In fact I think the top five guys are all
throwing Alabama Rig.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.740
And you know Lake Guntersville.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.220
BassResource fans especially know Lake Guntersville
from some of your trips there and it's heavily

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.220
pressured.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.930
I can tell you that, you know, you can be
there on a Monday, on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.460
on a Thursday from 6 a.m. to dark and there's
a hundred boats out there every day of every

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.460
week.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460
It's that kind of lake.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.490
If you can imagine the intense pressure on
that lake.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.560
It's every day.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.560
And we've got this tournament going on right
now in the Fall which is a tough bite anyway.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.870
Yet these guys are killing them.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.970
These guys are bringing in incredible stringers.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.750
And again the essence of what I'm trying to
say to you here is, when you show these fish,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.841
no matter how pressured they are, something
that's truly unique and different, you're

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.870
going to get a big response from the fish.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:13.720
And so the Alabama rig is unique and the bigger
picture of this is when you're faced with

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.680
a situation when you've got heavily pressured
fish, they've seen everything in the book.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.360
A lot of times it's a good thing to think
outside the box and to show them something

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.030
they've never seen before.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.410
So, Alabama rig, it's not a joke.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.410
People are fishing it.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.600
Give it a try.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.360
I think it's going to be something that has
some success, especially in the short term.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.020
And again, the bigger picture, don't be closed
minded.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.230
No matter how much you love to throw your
favorite bait, if you get in a place where

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.680
they've seen every bait in the book, try something
different.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.640
Don't be afraid to go outside of the world
of bass fishing.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.840
Go to salt water, go to trout fishing.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.590
Go to walleye and try some of the techniques
that work in those arenas and you might find

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.700
a hot bait too.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.710
So that's the Alabama rig.
