00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 nintendo does not give me permission to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
 record and publish other games 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
 this however does not prevent you from making a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.290
 unboxing of this special 3ds version 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 limited with super smash bros for 3ds 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.130
 already installed inside 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 I've never done an unboxing in my life 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.730
 I probably won't make any more but 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 this is right to go against the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.849
 nintendo and their stupid and laws 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.899
 here is the package here if you want 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 see the back side where it says 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.090
 all the things that are in it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:46.760
 of course let's take a look 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.760
 inside a little stuck 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.370
 here we do not understand the usual 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 packet with instructions inside and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.720
 for use in nintendo club not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 He doesn't show them to you naturally 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.930
 otherwise you will benefit from it instead 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.100
 my 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.080
 among is the guide the manual of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 instructions the quick guide for nintendo 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 ds as I said before has the cards of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 augmented reality or cards r us e 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 prefer for those who don't know 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 are the cards that practically with one 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.440
 with a special with a special 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.660
 function within 3ds take sheet metal 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000
 via camera on these 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.180
 cards and you'll see characters in three 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.180
 dimensions 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.860
 and here is 3ds 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.360
 corbelli packed a new new of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 mint 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.340
 here is very strong, all shiny 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.289
 compared to my other one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.580
 I mean a bit dull as you see me 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.580
 ironic that it is the same color then 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:10.110
 part under the nib here a 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.009
 attention there is no battery ie 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.770
 battery year 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.650
 the power supply so if by chance you want 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.660
 get it you will need to bring a 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.849
 power supply already for 3ds xl separately 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.610
 or use the same one you had 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:30.080
 for the original 3ds, look good 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.080
 I am I look at me 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.920
 well that's done 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.520
 I think it's everything you do n't know exactly how 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.290
 how to conclude an unboxing since 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 I've never done this, however, at least 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.190
 in protest I didn't feel like doing it 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.730
 here the attack 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.730
 over and out
