they're<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:19.800> long<00:00:20.490> um<00:00:20.910> they're<00:00:21.390> actually

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
they're really long um they're actually

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
they're really long um they're actually
way<00:00:22.050> longer<00:00:22.350> than<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> sims<00:00:23.369> 3<00:00:23.519> cheats<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that you can build I think it's all of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
that you can build I think it's all of
them<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.930> them<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.570 
say just ten let's just max it out not
twenty<00:02:35.930> let's<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:36.650> max<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.220> out<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.400> think

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
twenty let's just max it out I think

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.220 
twenty let's just max it out I think
maybe<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.540> max<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.230> eight<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:39.710> we'll<00:02:39.890> see<00:02:40.130> oh

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
maybe the max is eight but we'll see oh

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
maybe the max is eight but we'll see oh
my<00:02:42.230> gosh<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.800> says<00:02:43.010> acquired<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.520> programming

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
my gosh it says acquired the programming

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.230 
my gosh it says acquired the programming
skill<00:02:45.190> caresses<00:02:46.190> new<00:02:46.400> scoring<00:02:46.670> program<00:02:47.060> will

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
skill caresses new scoring program will

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.820 
skill caresses new scoring program will
allow<00:02:47.360> her<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.840> hack<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> practice

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
allow her to hack and practice

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.440 
allow her to hack and practice
programming<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.640> higher<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.030> level<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
programming the higher the level of the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.900 
programming the higher the level of the
skills<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.900> more<00:02:51.050> hacking<00:02:51.320> opportunities

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
skills and more hacking opportunities

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.850 
skills and more hacking opportunities
will<00:02:52.910> emerge<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.840> she's<00:02:54.680> maxed<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.430> out<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.120> uh

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
will emerge and she's maxed it out so uh

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.860 
will emerge and she's maxed it out so uh
I<00:02:57.860> don't<00:02:58.250> know<00:02:58.340> why<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.730> didn't<00:02:59.150> say<00:02:59.300> maxed

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I don't know why I just didn't say maxed

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.990 
I don't know why I just didn't say maxed
but<00:03:00.140> we're<00:03:00.290> gonna<00:03:00.440> make<00:03:00.770> sure<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:01.700> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
but we're gonna make sure that it is and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.120 
but we're gonna make sure that it is and
it<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.780> maxed<00:03:03.560> out<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:05.320> yes<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.590> guys<00:03:06.770> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
it is it is maxed out so yes you guys I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.350 
it is it is maxed out so yes you guys I
think<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.120> amazing<00:03:08.810> because<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:10.090> want<00:03:11.090> my

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
think this is amazing because I want my

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.660 
think this is amazing because I want my
sims<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.170> sims<00:03:12.410> 4<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.770> like<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> lot

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
sims and the sims 4 to like have a lot

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.970 
sims and the sims 4 to like have a lot
of<00:03:13.820> different<00:03:14.150> skills<00:03:14.390> they<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:15.290> build<00:03:15.830> our

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
of different skills they do build our

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.970 
of different skills they do build our
skills<00:03:16.310> fast<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.090> guess<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.840> way<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.620> depends

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
skills fast I guess in a way it depends

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.370 
skills fast I guess in a way it depends
on<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.190> sim<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.330> which<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.110> cool

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
on the sim so which is really cool

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380 
on the sim so which is really cool
because<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.830> does<00:03:22.130> depend<00:03:22.580> on<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.790> person<00:03:22.910> in

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
because it does depend on the person in

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.720 
because it does depend on the person in
real<00:03:23.540> life<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.130> depends<00:03:25.130> on<00:03:25.280> how<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.459> learning

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
real life so depends on how you learning

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.430 
real life so depends on how you learning
everything<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:26.870> those<00:03:27.020> of<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.230> who<00:03:27.260> don't

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
everything but those of you who don't

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.570 
everything but those of you who don't
want<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> sit<00:03:27.770> around<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.100> wait<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.489> your

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
want to sit around and wait for your

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.380 
want to sit around and wait for your
sims<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> perfect<00:03:30.200> cheat<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.910> yeah<00:03:31.910> so
