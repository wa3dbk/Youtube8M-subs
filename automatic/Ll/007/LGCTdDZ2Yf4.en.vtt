it's got a I know my GP 13 had screens

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's got a I know my GP 13 had screens
on<00:00:29.339> some<00:00:29.579> tracks<00:00:29.819> as<00:00:30.089> well<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:31.970> did<00:00:32.970> actually

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
on some tracks as well that did actually

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.450 
on some tracks as well that did actually
show<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.670> riding<00:00:35.670> around<00:00:35.789> and<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.780> looks<00:00:36.989> like

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
show you riding around and it looks like

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.279 
show you riding around and it looks like
the<00:00:38.460> screen<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.210> shot<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.690> doing<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
the screen and this shot is doing the

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.860 
the screen and this shot is doing the
same<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.120> good<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.420> they've<00:00:42.539> kept<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
same so it's good that they've kept the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
same so it's good that they've kept the
screens<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.519> races

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
screens because when you go to races

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
screens because when you go to races
there<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.570> screens<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.410> track<00:00:46.679> so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there are screens all over the track so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.910 
there are screens all over the track so
that<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.579> what's<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.920> because

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that you can see what's going on because

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.849 
that you can see what's going on because
obviously<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> tracks<00:00:51.859> depending

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
obviously it's a lot of tracks depending

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.450 
obviously it's a lot of tracks depending
where<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> track<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.030> can't<00:00:54.269> see

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
where you are on the track you can't see

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.139 
where you are on the track you can't see
any<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> other<00:00:57.600> corners<00:00:58.019> but<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:59.149> mean

going to look like hopefully close to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.740 
going to look like hopefully close to
this<00:01:10.440> there's<00:01:10.650> no<00:01:10.680> reason<00:01:11.070> why<00:01:11.190> they<00:01:11.370> can't

car at the end of the day it'll be

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.910 
car at the end of the day it'll be
interesting<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.209> see<00:03:09.299> what<00:03:09.810> kind<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.470> handling

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
interesting to see what kind of handling

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.559 
interesting to see what kind of handling
they<00:03:11.159> give<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.489> because<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.849> know<00:03:11.909> in<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.359> past

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
they give it because I know in the past

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.720 
they give it because I know in the past
a<00:03:12.959> lot<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.200> car<00:03:13.440> games<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:14.400> I've<00:03:14.549> had

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
a lot of car games that I've had

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.080 
a lot of car games that I've had
motorbikes<00:03:15.450> implemented<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.730> they<00:03:17.730> often

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
motorbikes implemented in it they often

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.949 
motorbikes implemented in it they often
give<00:03:18.359> car<00:03:19.169> handling<00:03:19.620> characteristics<00:03:20.099> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
give car handling characteristics and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.819 
give car handling characteristics and
the<00:03:21.959> bikes<00:03:22.169> just<00:03:22.500> feel<00:03:23.090> really<00:03:24.090> bad<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.829> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the bikes just feel really bad so I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.349 
the bikes just feel really bad so I
don't<00:03:26.459> think<00:03:26.579> they<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.790> give<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> car

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
don't think they can give a car

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.110 
don't think they can give a car
motorbike<00:03:28.079> handling<00:03:29.120> characteristics

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
motorbike handling characteristics

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.930 
motorbike handling characteristics
because<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.959> doesn't<00:03:31.260> lean<00:03:31.669> so<00:03:32.669> will<00:03:32.819> be

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
because it doesn't lean so will be

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.250 
because it doesn't lean so will be
interested<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.329> see<00:03:33.480> what<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.750> handling<00:03:34.109> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
interested to see what the handling is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.750 
interested to see what the handling is
like<00:03:37.669> but<00:03:38.669> other<00:03:38.940> than<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.780> mean<00:03:40.760> you'll

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
like but other than that I mean you'll

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.280 
like but other than that I mean you'll
probably<00:03:42.120> only<00:03:42.329> be<00:03:42.450> able<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:43.579> drive<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.730> in

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
probably only be able to drive it in

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.030 
probably only be able to drive it in
probably<00:03:46.290> time<00:03:46.590> trials<00:03:47.599> because<00:03:48.859> if<00:03:49.859> you're

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
probably time trials because if you're

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
probably time trials because if you're
going<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.220> drive<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.609> for<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.629> races<00:03:52.079> all

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
going to drive it for the races all

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.420 
going to drive it for the races all
you're<00:03:52.349> going<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.799> follow<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.220> bikes

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
you're going to do is follow the bikes

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.770 
you're going to do is follow the bikes
fall<00:03:53.669> in<00:03:53.760> love<00:03:53.879> and<00:03:53.910> then<00:03:54.090> go<00:03:54.269> into<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.540> piss

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
fall in love and then go into the piss

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.780 
fall in love and then go into the piss
and<00:03:54.989> that's<00:03:55.139> it<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:56.209> definitely<00:03:57.209> need<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:59.780> see

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and that's it so definitely need to see

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.159 
and that's it so definitely need to see
what<00:04:02.790> they're<00:04:02.970> doing<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.660> mean<00:04:03.810> like

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
what they're doing with this I mean like

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.640 
what they're doing with this I mean like
I<00:04:04.230> said<00:04:04.349> if<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.919> actually<00:04:05.129> real<00:04:07.639> also<00:04:08.639> why<00:04:08.970> I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
I said if it is actually real also why I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.349 
I said if it is actually real also why I
mean<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:11.370> other<00:04:11.519> end<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.849> skill<00:04:12.060> why<00:04:12.209> have

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
mean the other end of skill why have

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.740 
mean the other end of skill why have
they<00:04:12.480> even<00:04:12.569> done<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.109> they<00:04:13.319> could've<00:04:14.750> it

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
they even done this they could've it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.080 
they even done this they could've it
probably<00:04:16.320> took<00:04:16.590> quite<00:04:16.859> quite<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> lot<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.729> man

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
probably took quite quite a lot of man

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.680 
probably took quite quite a lot of man
power<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:20.130> hours<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:22.130> make<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
power and hours to make it and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.680 
power and hours to make it and
I<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:26.100> think<00:04:26.250> why<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.910> they<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.150> use<00:04:27.420> that

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
I just think why can they have use that

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.950 
I just think why can they have use that
to<00:04:28.020> improve<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.010> game<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.670> define<00:04:30.450> tweaks

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
to improve the game just define tweaks

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.800 
to improve the game just define tweaks
and<00:04:31.790> just<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.060> don't<00:04:33.750> know<00:04:34.050> just<00:04:35.780> make<00:04:36.780> it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and just I don't know just make it

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.900 
and just I don't know just make it
better<00:04:37.200> do<00:04:37.410> their<00:04:37.590> fine<00:04:37.800> tweets<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.370> handle<00:04:38.820> in

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
better do their fine tweets to handle in

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.590 
better do their fine tweets to handle in
tweets<00:04:39.270> graphical<00:04:39.930> tweaks<00:04:40.290> anything<00:04:40.890> just

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
tweets graphical tweaks anything just

this has never been done before but is
it<00:06:20.580> really<00:06:20.790> necessary<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.600> do<00:06:22.110> we<00:06:22.230> really<00:06:22.470> need
