part<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> reason<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.460> when<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
part of the reason is because when you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450 
part of the reason is because when you
use<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.240> oils<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.720> most<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.460> ethnic

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
people use and when I say ethnic I mean

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.910 
people use and when I say ethnic I mean
Indian<00:01:16.740> Chinese<00:01:17.010> like<00:01:17.880> anything<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.630> than

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
Indian Chinese like anything other than

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.470 
Indian Chinese like anything other than
you<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.130> anyway<00:01:21.740> that's<00:01:22.740> besides<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.250> point

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.600 

it's<00:01:27.480> good<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.980> fry<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it's good because when you fry with it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's good because when you fry with it
it<00:01:29.760> doesn't<00:01:30.000> become<00:01:30.890> carcinogenic<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:33.210> if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
