00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
it went really really good you see to
those<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.870> big<00:00:49.079> nuts<00:00:49.340> right<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:52.789> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
those two big nuts right there and I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.709 
those two big nuts right there and I
produce<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.840> nice<00:00:55.230> sturdy<00:00:55.710> branch<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.340> there

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
produce a nice sturdy branch right there

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
produce a nice sturdy branch right there
so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:59.629> grew<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.170> those<00:01:01.670> habaneros<00:01:05.360> those

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so I grew a lot of those habaneros those

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
so I grew a lot of those habaneros those
are<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> red<00:01:08.040> habaneros<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
are I think the red habaneros are a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 
are I think the red habaneros are a
little<00:01:09.210> milder<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.830> orange<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.729> think

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
little milder than the orange I think

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.230 
little milder than the orange I think
the<00:01:12.180> worst<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> orange<00:01:14.610> habaneros

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the worst kind is the orange habaneros

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.429 
the worst kind is the orange habaneros
which<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.439> course<00:01:16.610> as<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.970> ripens<00:01:18.479> they<00:01:19.229> goes

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
which of course as the ripens they goes

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
which of course as the ripens they goes
from<00:01:19.470> yellow<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.759> orange<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> red<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
from yellow to orange to red and the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.190 
from yellow to orange to red and the
tends<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.009> lose<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:24.150> Scoville<00:01:24.600> units<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> the
