00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.509

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.340
 today introducing a pair of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.309
 shoes salma the type ec skype gtx en 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 gore-tex finish so this is a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.310
 quite versatile shoe that has like 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.869
 first use for outings 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 outdoor little to medium technical so 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.200
 this shoe is quite versatile and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.989
 her design is quite sober she does 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.040
 go everywhere with jeans in the middle 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.379
 urban it's really discreet when we 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.090
 fate for a little more in the green 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 where there are a few more levels 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.039
 so they are really very 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.000
 versatile and they respond well what 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.329
 they are asked about the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 shoe construction so we are 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:06.830
 on the front we have one by stone really 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.830
 useful and very powerful 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.270
 the type of this mail is a sole 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.620
 type counts flu that passions we see 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.410
 well so really with some good 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.680
 crampons just right after that is 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.770
 not a shoe to go to the mountains 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.650
 to his people inside they are 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.210
 to say we have a sole that 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.580
 reinforced at the level of the vault 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 plantar it avoids everything that is out 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.320
 sion 1 so very good very good material 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.260
 even at the level above it's in 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.910
 son and daughter wicks for everything 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.290
 which is dusty noises so it's 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.740
 really good waterproof to talk 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 waterproof we have a slipper 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 entirely in gore-tex we can see 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 recognize the little logo there that is on 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 the back of the shoe the seams 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.590
 are really waterproof is really 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 well waterproof ie a shoe that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.470
 small size so I had to take 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.780
 a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.989
 a size above me 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.540
 usual size so really a 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.890
 a nice shoe to wear in 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.890
 all conditions 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.840
 at the level of its weight it is they are 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.360
 for a pair like this one in size 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.130
 46 they are 8 187 g so I find myself 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.440
 that still goes for this type of 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.180
 shoes 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 I really come back to their versatility 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.330
 really impressive 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.750
 so regarding the rates on 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.580
 is around 110 euros for 7 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.560
 for this pair it's a good 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.190
 investment you really will not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 disappointed here soon for others 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.570
 videos 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.570
