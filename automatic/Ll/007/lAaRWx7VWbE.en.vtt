00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 at the gamescom there are as usual 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.220
 many more players play even more games 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.420
 more games and a lot more players 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 and they are all at some 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.469
 and in our top 5 place 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.469
 The loudest was the fair 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.630
 now at the train was very long 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 and we think it's great 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.830
 they are enough 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.330
 place four robots 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.890
 the actual start of titles is 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.890
 actually relatively calm but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.860
 and for that very reason hard time in the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.240
 Wheelchair definitely one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.229
 placement with us for which I am pleased 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 me somewhere on the game 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.460
 I am also very excited depart 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.780
 the hall 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.729
 too bad we do not have the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 have the time to play but the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.409
 others and if you want you can 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.990
 look at you here 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.460
 that's why they're in uniform that's why 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.460
 my favorite hall here now 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 he needs nice in the uniform if 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 you have giant robots 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.460
 3rd place was the friendliest 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.710
 Naturally, Nintendo is allowed to play gamescom 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.270
 Do not miss this year you feel yourself 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.590
 even a tender stood a bit like that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.859
 as in the domestic living room 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.890
 so even the maxim sits a 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.270
 little love very much thinking 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 I'll give you directions 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.629
 play mario 3d world 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 a small bar 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.770
 So everything is one 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.030
 but that we only a part of the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.710
 rising trend has this is such a 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.750
 a bit detached from the own stand 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.300
 the bulk of the gamescom booth 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.460
 nintendo is just in the short 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.800
 if I want to turn very short swico 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.290
 thank you because here are games like 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.180
 the new zelda so the hd remake of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.580
 the wind waker there is the new mario 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.320
 kart wii mario kart for the video 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.850
 there is donkey kong country dry picture 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.990
 fries and so on and so forth 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
 this is a greeting and none 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.700
 success 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.319
 a part of the whole stand and that's why 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.319
 because we definitely do not 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.209
 keep club 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.209
 second place is the largest state 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:03.349
 three hours I do not think so 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.909
 three hours well and stay this 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.319
 six hours year starts today at 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.470
 blockbuster like her cod only six 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.270
 hours 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.710
 wait to invite and it's not like that 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.970
 unusual is these six hours 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.610
 not here but that is with 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.260
 distance 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.150
 game was to her at gamescom 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.070
 there and there is like everyone else 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.200
 Of course, the rest was always mine 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.420
 say tomorrow so Thursday in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800
 the route which and I have to do 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.060
 he always get up early and citizens sub 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.060
 access and so here too 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.680
 and here is our first place 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.700
 attitude heap of dirt 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.510
 it is indeed an impressive one 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.980
 instant thanks maxi seriously than it 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.810
 is actually impossible for here 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.340
 The first place to decide is there 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.590
 many great cities in recent years 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.120
 we could firmly but class and rhone 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.130
 and so on below as there is 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.930
 unbelievably many cool booths are not too 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.920
 forget the outages what they are 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.989
 for example, the beer stand 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.430
 why why not why 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.750
 there are many again 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.490
 activities that's why you can 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.170
 actually summarize a saying 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.210
 Apart from this nice bunch 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.650
