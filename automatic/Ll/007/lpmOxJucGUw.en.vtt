00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 mr jan niklas of cinema check here 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.799
 This time it's with the movie girls 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.810
 By the way , the original has a walk of fame 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.680
 ie tomorrow the original title so much 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.480
 more suitable if you are in germany 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.490
 actually say put six 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.490
 the topic misses that you are experiencing now 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.250
 we're going to party now can be fine 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 but I remain one of my jogging pants 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.730
 important concern 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.730
 I do not own what else this videos 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 but the places disappear 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.860
 do you think lengefeld bring now 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.850
 I'll take you home safely where do you live 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850
 do you live there? 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.810
 what you me 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.170
 the girls' evening work the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210
 newsreader megan mainz 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.300
 played by elisabeth bank because one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 local stations in lw and is very short 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.690
 before the big jump on the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 career ladder because a nationwide 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.820
 sender would like to take over and wants 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 that she works with them in the studio 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.229
 to celebrate and also a little bit too 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 forget that your friend is watching you 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.850
 you have left in the evening 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.830
 celebrate their girls and do it 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 Of course, really fat hung up opas 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.840
 part so that she is completely over and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.330
 wake up in the middle of the night at gordon 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 played by james watson where 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 She then on her phone on her 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.960
 mailbox get a call that you completely 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.660
 must be early in the sender around your hot 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 get a coveted job 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.110
 Of course she pulls another runs 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.000
 Let's run out of the house and how it works 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.580
 accidentally, your car just wants to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.009
 Towed and towed this 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.899
 Author's enters a wave of absurdity 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.890
 Events are going on that make you feel so real 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 can not imagine 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.300
 but what exactly happens that you see 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.009
 in the cinema is the main focus of the film 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.480
 clearly the word prejudice because of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 Early in the morning dressed in a nearly 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.410
 Skin tight dress running down the street 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 is either a prostitute was 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.550
 a drug addict star so at least 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.080
 the film is claimed to be true 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.060
 also relatively exactly the nerve of ours 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.860
 society because of these benefits 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.959
 This totally absurd works 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 history of megan miles trying 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.069
 to come from a to b and was there from 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 one in the next hole awkward 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.569
 there are still some stumbling 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.090
 Prejudices completely reversed and that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.350
 gives the film even more joke 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 First of all you have to say is the movie 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.580
 But girls are really funny 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.750
 One should be a little bit expecting his 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.370
 screw down if anything 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.140
 one also the secret good trailer 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.980
 has seen because it is just one 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.990
 comedy 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.530
 the movie does not come with infinite depth 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.160
 going story therefore as well as at 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.800
 but not like others 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.450
 Communities do not want to travel here 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.620
 So with each witthaut one necessarily 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 from the stool and the settlement of 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.220
 whole cinema 8 you have to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.900
 say that here you elizabeth banks 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.800
 definitely a big praise 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.840
 can pronounce 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.180
 because she tears a stolen yet 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.190
 definitely the whole movie out again 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 refers to them 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.730
 she is in the picture all the time this is 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.100
 a real big challenge and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.130
 There is definitely a lot of steam for that 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.840
 yes, even if you say many jokes now 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.970
 pretty much that is not really going on 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.190
 bad because the film is a crazy 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.480
 joke density a stock in the stock 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.980
 if one does not count one 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.360
 little flau comes along is the direct 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.570
 caught again and just you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.490
 already said with elizabeth banks 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.120
 acting solid performance becomes 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.680
 the total crash prevented fortunately 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.410
 but unfortunately there are none 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.630
 Real jokes where you just laugh like that 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 the duo does not exist from autumn onwards 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.320
 a pity but a biggest one 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.110
 Critic point in our opinion is 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.450
 this completely completely wrong 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.860
 german titles i mean girls 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.420
 are the first few minutes of the film 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.700
 that's not even the story that is 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.920
 nothing that misses topic I'm sorry 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.230
 so what of the original title walk of 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.140
 fame is fitting the fits it is 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.330
 long movie around the walk of fame the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.920
 funny is the funny is not quite 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.390
 as funny as it could be, but it is 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.519
 is the board of sale and who is a blog 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.560
 ever known in our society it 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.539
 should work on his lifestyle 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.039
 because either he has the word 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.430
 know or do I have myself once 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.660
 go through what fact is we have 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.840
 every now and then in Germany 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.280
 some damn stupid film titles find 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.180
 i sound in the usa everything is always like this 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.380
 cool then the movie comes after 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.270
 Germany you you think yes that also has 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.870
 nothing to do with what you think 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.030
 you about it 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.139
 do you know such film titles on you see 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.759
 it is now for example at girls evening 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.509
 just write us down below 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.639
 in the comments 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.440
 yes, now it was time to come to the conclusion 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.940
 with the film gets from us six of 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.530
 ten points for the cinema general 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.509
 So for every cinema viewer has so 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.430
 happened to stumble on this movie 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.620
 In summer he gets one more point 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.810

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.030
 Comedy and I'm coming 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.740
 The sector is already bad first

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.540
 Transitions of the respective individual jokes 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.400
 unfortunately not so great as having 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.020
