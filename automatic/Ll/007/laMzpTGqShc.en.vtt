 silent doors high speeds 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.300
 main low cost of design 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.490
 construction 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.110
 3 lines of the Belarusian metro nothing 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.680
 will not yield to the modern world 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.720
 analogs 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.400
 like for example polish subway and and 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.330
 the second line opened only a few 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.710
 months ago 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.840
 second line of the Warsaw metro 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.510
 has become unique to Europe 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.760
 architectural and engineering project she 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.010
 went right under the center of Warsaw and everything 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.750
 work from start to finish took only 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.699
 three years deadline several times 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.739
 tolerated but polish metro builders 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.250
 managed to conquer both groundwater and river 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.080
 wisla 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.729
 one of the new national stations 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.670
 the stadium is located almost under 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:43.159
 water Warsaw was very difficult to build 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.049
 the complexity of the soil and relief in the tunnels 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.750
 found unexploded shells of times 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.190
 wars and work stopped like 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.629
 only earned the second line we 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.580
 significantly unloaded the city 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.600
 we have more than one and a half transport 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.760
 million passengers 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.350
 Warsaw experience to build the metro quickly and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.119
 with minimal expense can serve 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 during construction and design 3 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.570
 Minsk metro line Belarusian 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.250
 metro builders are already studying 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.380
 experience of the Polish colleagues of engineers 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.969
 introduced the company diplomats more 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.250
 four years working in the market of Belarus 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.969
 currently the company has its 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:22.630
 Minsk office participated in 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:26.259
 implementing several projects for example 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.439
 creating a second metro line 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.659
 Minsk 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.500
 as well as a number of objects of the Belarusian 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.329
 railroad 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.979
 the company is willing to invest in 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.929
 Belarusian metro has been working for many years 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.590
 the whole of Europe the amount of the transaction is not yet 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.810
 divulged hope that our project 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.700
 will be interesting for Belarusian colleagues 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.710
 we know that in Minsk they will build 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.109
 we have the most modern metro 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.420
 modern technology minimum of noise and 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.609
 vibrations will look exactly like 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.200
 the third line of Minsk and the subway is 14 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.390
 stations which connect green onions 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.130
 soon savchin this is still unknown but 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.170
 experts say they will build by 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.999
 most modern technologies to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 to realize the ambitious task to be 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.020
 pass under the ground almost 20 kilometers from 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.119
 Convenience passengers build three 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.280
 interchange nodes will thereby 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.760
 created the so -called transfer 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 triangular city center 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.129
 maybe to change from a sock lived 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.250
 or from one to another and allow 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.170
 passengers with one change go to 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.239
 any district of the city of Minsk to ours 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 I think it should be completely 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.030
 automated metro can 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.879
 move without a driver once a second 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.180
 station to be equipped with barriers 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.709
 which will preclude the fall of collaboration 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.659
 with the Poles does not mean that I will do everything 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.159
 foreigner use of domestic 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.750

 Belarusian specialists one of 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.840
 conditions are now our metro builders 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.760
 complete the preparatory work 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 shift and not and heating 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 design new stations to be in time 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.010
 time to fall in Minsk to earn and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.139
 modern tunnel complex 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 which will significantly speed up the gasket
