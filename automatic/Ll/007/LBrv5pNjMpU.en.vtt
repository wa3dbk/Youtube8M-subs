00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 I show you in today's video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.710
 metal which is almost as heavy as 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.330
 Gold is showing with my gallium video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 you already have a metal which 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 Himself through his very low 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.210
 melting point so by this particular 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 Property strong from other metals 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
 differentiates but there are still many 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 other metals which through 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 highlight special features eg 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.949
 the non-radioactive non-precious metal 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 wolf frame but what special 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.390
 property has tungsten we have here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 three equal cylinders one out 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 plastic the other aluminum and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 a selection of frack and down to the color 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.559
 they do not differ either 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 especially 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.100
 the particular difference is only clear 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
 if you want to try the cylinders 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 lift up while getting the first ones 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.640
 two cylinders still relatively high 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 gets noticed when lifting the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.840
 third cylinder that this very much 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.270
 is heavier and although all three 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.980
 cylinders have the same volume 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 sometimes comes to show how much 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.030
 heavier the tungsten cylinder is going to be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 I lie the three-cylinder 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 Plastic cylinder has a weight of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 21 grams more cylinder from the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
 alloy of aluminum is 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.299
 about 43 3 grams about twice 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.210
 while the same size tungsten cylinder 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.830
 about 300 grams on the scales gets that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 is as much as three bars of chocolate 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 and about seven times the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 aluminum cylinder if you like the whole 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.030
 Now it looks like the wolf run 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 cylinder about 19 3 grams per 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 cubic centimeter 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 or 19 three kilograms per cubic meter 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 Incidentally, in this unit, too, the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.920
 density of substances indicated with this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.439
 value, the density of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 tungsten only very slightly from that of gold 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.009
 and that is one of the characteristics 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 why tungsten is so interesting to me 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.729
 I have never had it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 something tight in the hand and unfortunately 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.119
 you can not go through alone either 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.920
 Introduce this video to you as it is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 now it feels like something in the hand 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.149
 But what do you think about it? 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.049
 the fact that there are metals like that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.670
 are heavy 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.829
 you also want to know how it is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 Feels like a heavy metal in the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.590
 to keep writing me in the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.879
 Comments 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.500
 Did you already know about that? 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.629
 second special features of 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.799
 wolf frame this is namely with a 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.620
 melting point of about 3422 degrees celsius 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.569
 the metal with the highest melting point 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.819
 this is only surpassed by the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.269
 not with alcoholic substance because this has 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.640
 a melting point of about 3,600 42 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.019
 Celsius this is therefore also 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.360
 the element with the highest 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.160
 Melting point of the high melting point of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 Wolfram is one of the reasons why 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.360
 the blooms of old light bulbs 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 this metal exist and therefore wish 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.840
 I wish you a lot of fun with the smart ass 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.519
 you still have to like windows 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.470
 be sure to watch the video by myself 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.540
 a metal show which the warm 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.160
 water can melt and do not forget 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.049
 to give the thumbs up and the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.280
 press abo button and another 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.280
 experiment to miss more
