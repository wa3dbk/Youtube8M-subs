00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.680
 let's occupy a good size tongue 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.369
 10 the small family or if we do not buy 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.130
 two for a family more or less large 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.920
 to sew it, we are going to occupy a piece of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.759
 onion and a fist of bay leaves and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.180
 salt to accompany we are going to use 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.940
 these radishes and we will also occupy 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.489
 cilantro we will also occupy avocado and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.970
 this is to taste or you like 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.130
 and also chopped onion for 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.480
 tortillas already occupy this corn flour 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.480
 which is tastier 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.090
 we are going to put the tongue to cook in a 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.180
 Steam pot age by approximately 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 an hour with salt and onion leaves 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
 laurel if they do not have a steamer pot 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.470
 you can put the one early and it takes 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.410
 from 3 to 4 hours since the language is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.479
 cooked we're going to start skinning the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.710
 or remove that little pellet that is left 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.870
 above 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.840
 remember that one hour is enough 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.300
 for cooking in the steamer and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.290
 good since we removed all the little body 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.840
 what's there, we just throw it away and go 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 to start applying it with a knife 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.540
 Be careful if it's hot and we 're going to 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.130
 make into small pieces like that in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.610
 squares all completely 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 to stay this way more or less like this 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.369
 finely chopped finely apart in a 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:49.530
 pan I'll put enough oil or 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.020
 little to put to sautÃ© this meat 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.509
 already well chopped can make it well fried 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.060
 or just to heat it depends on the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.750
 like you I like only 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.079
 heat it and apart I have ready my 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.929
 100 x tortillas quotations pique the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.920
 cilantro also pique 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:14.489
 finely onion and sliced 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.280
 radishes to accompany and of course 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.380
 the hot sauce can not miss and good 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.780
 this we are going to add the onion and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.900

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.640
 I'm going to add avocado 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 chopped and of course 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.360
 spicy can add salt if it makes you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.530
 missing and with permission and well they were left
