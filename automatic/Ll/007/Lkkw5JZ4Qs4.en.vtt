00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello ladies and gentlemen subscribers 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.560
 channel pixel world with you valentine 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.500
 and today we talk about the universe dc a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.309
 more precisely about one very very important 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 the film adaptation well and also touch on the topic 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:24.029
 igrodelov so let 's go gaming channel 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 we will begin to represent the pixel world 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 Perhaps with the movie I will say that the movie man 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 whether i liked one i don't 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 his masterpieces or something similar but how 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 fan of the universe dc movie not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.480
 I liked it all the more interesting to me 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.260
 look at how far it goes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.350
 deductible franchise 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 be as we know in 2016 before the movie 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 shifted to the next year apparently not 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 It manages or something like that carry cases 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.739
 the point is that in 2016 there will be a movie 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 zack snider where batman and superman 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.609
 will work together 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 I really like this idea 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 more look at a separate movie about 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 batman i.e. restart it would be now 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 it is not reasonable since all the same the memory of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.810
 the franchise of the nolan dark trilogy 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 knight she still did not wither but here 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.700
 duet of superman and batman is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.189
 really very reasonable and just not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 have to restart batman do 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.729
 separate film immediately cast it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 superman and thus gets already 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.990
 ready start seems to me a league 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 justice is simply impossible in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 Nolan's universe, it is too close 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 to the real world but Zack is different 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
 he first started superman and now 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 successfully continue to begin with the fact that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.350
 This movie Batman plays Ban Affleck 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.790
 am I the only one to learn about 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.670
 the actor who will play 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.670
 one of the main characters did not scream 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's recall the public reaction in 2008 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.140
 year when people know who will play 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.570
 joker movie dark knight was 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.210
 perhaps even worse than now 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.980
 however you are looking at what happened 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.530
 in the end maybe and now there will be something 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.260
 like all the same people in the studio because they 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300
 no fools say so therefore not worth it 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.160
 hurry up with conclusions let's at least 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.350
 trailer wait for the film 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.500
 joined the wonder woman but again 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 I do not believe that in this chapter of the story 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.180
 they deployed the start of the justice league 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.370
 just rather what a miracle woman to do 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.800
 some kind of surprise at the end of the film or even 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.530
 after the credits and in the end I want 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.110
 underline the name batman vs 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.459
 superman seems to me this is a working title 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.310
 and most likely will 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.709
 I'll change it now I don't really like it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.220
 there are still rumors that a flash movie 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.530
 want to stir up in 2016 but now 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.230
 probably this case will be moved forward 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.270
 i think the warner brothers could 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.730
 cast a character from the show 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.370
 arrow there is already a ready member of the team 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880
 green arrow and the story of the flash in 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.220
 series 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.170
 deployed very soon more than that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.200
 actors in full positive from such an idea 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.330
 but wait and see now a little bit 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.299
 let's talk about games or rather about one 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.540
 the series is wonderful and so is kevin conroy 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.209
 the famous voice of Batman in March 2013 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.730
 years when I visited the press conference 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.060
 in dallas he said that he is already 10 months 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.160
 working on a game that is just 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.070
 great but natural game about 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.590
 Batman and that moment was still very little 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.930
 information in origin and many thought 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.670
 what is it like the announcement of the fact that he 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 still voiced by batman again 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.209
 turned out to be not after tweeted wrote 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.549
 what a confusion dallas i'm new 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.540
 the game about batman but not work more jeans 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.000
 which will appear 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 this fall and of course the record was 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.130
 soon removed so how about this and 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.230
 probably should not know but such as y 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.970
 we make up the whole picture 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.850
 the fact that the developers site was 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.299
 open vacancies describing development 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.910
 one of the most successful games of 2014 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.940
 only confirms all our guesses 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.320
 it becomes clear that warner brosers 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.340
 formed a development team to 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.709
 they created 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.169
 anything based on current technology 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.770
 with whom Rox used to work 3 well 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.990
 and everything is even better today 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.060
 conversations with you so for future 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.550
 discussion subscribe to pixel channel 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.130
 world as well as my channel link 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.150
 will certainly be in the description 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.150
 see you friends
