00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.650
 For example, in the rain with short pants 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.989
 make tutorial with short t shirts 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.010
 completely wet and ill no 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.980
 I do not give a damn 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.460
 or no idea with the exercise ball 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.110
 tutorial or so in any case 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 you think up something when you 're up 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 friday the 80 likes on the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.710
 facebook page lot to football freestyle 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.580
 which links in the description 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.000
 linked is a lot of fun that creates 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.740
 de network creates her it would be whole 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.950

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.799
 funny for you and now a lot for me 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.840
 have fun with the tutorial so that ebay again 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.310
 after the information with another 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.039
 tutorial and that is the archway 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.720
 surround world yes is not really 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.000
 as well as pieces wears in the hairdressing industry 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.009
 but you can still use it therefore 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 is very easy and can ye 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.000
 I still believe in something, and yes 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.149
 That's why we're looking for low now 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.149
 purely 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.280
 yes, why is it all already recognizable 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.380
 could tele top of the world series the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.140
 actually it is the crossover 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.299
 crossover just stops on the ground or 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.459
 or on the foot so you her 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.469
 I see jumps up but I read 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.000
 Just put the ball on my foot and 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.590
 makes it so easy over it is it 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.590
 and who will go jets closer 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.269
 let's come to the royal ones 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.280
 prerequisite for the job our country 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.810
 it will be the crossover yes i had 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.250
 already mentioned ask crossover 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.200
 Here you can see a jump at 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.849
 crossover riesch at the last game 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.829
 said yes and yes that is on everyone 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.780
 one requirement and another 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.120
 requirement is the alternative around 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.769
 the world in which the movement is very 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.609
 is more difficult than the top of the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.439
 world 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.269
 Still, you can do the alternative though 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.219
 under volt very quickly the popo and 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.420
 round the world plan and is therefore 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.909
 also a requirement 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.169
 Now we come to the premiere step of 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.859
 first step namely that the ball 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.049
 submit 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.299
 At the top of the world you have to get the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.489
 do not submit ball as ss not too high 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.290
 so deep and yes that could be him as always 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.329
 with the taq taq taq steps 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.799
 and then put the ball up and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.659
 then catch again and then again 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.140
 after doing is definitely the first 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.510
 step of the most important 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.890
 so you can tear nice 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.299
 Well, we come to the second and that 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.459
 one of the most important steps and indeed 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.409
 that is to have the ball on the foot 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.579
 yes, that is the most important move in the world 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.709
 top of the world 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.540
 We have to practice that by putting the ball 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.120
 is present at the top and then when foot 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.890
 Simply put up for the ball 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.470
 but do not just leave it there 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.540
 put down the foot but you have the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.879
 foot a little bit tense 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.379
 So that the ball bounces upwards 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.269
 pull the dry exercise can be seen 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.739
 diffuse a bit so and so on 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.540
 kneel so the bit goes down 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.829
 because then comes the ball it up 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.180
 but if you just lay down the foot 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.890
 then on the ball goes the ball 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.780
 are uncontrolled way and it must with 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.700
 That's why you have to print them 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.470
 do they Kniebis down and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.040
 Tighten a bit and then works 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.040
 all that already 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.550
 Now we come to the 2.2 step and that 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.820
 That's the weak wine over the ball 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.920
 yes, that 's after you all that 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.750
 have left a photo to serenity and 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.120
 then cover the weak legs 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 that is a practical as the acp only 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.030
 the other way 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.410
 there you can format as profit and 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.270
 from the alternative around the world was 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.710
 Berlin requirement has already been shown 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.480
 In any case could benefit from it 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.480
 that you do that then that is 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.070
 actually also a movement yes now 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.200
 we come to the result of the formula 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.390
 second step plus 2.2 step and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.490
 Although you can see there is a slow motion until the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.250
 second step and a two-point second 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.830
 step here see it still rewind 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.450
 now here second step on dozen 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.850
 make it very important to hitch and then 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.260
 the one about the weak two 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.610
 everywhere the 2.2 step is coming now 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.900
 it just for the pros you have to do now 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.130
 I can just do it again 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.550
 shown it is an advanced version 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.460
 from over the world 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.520
 now the father appears before 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.120
 prefers yes I can only say to rave 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.680
 and world that is not that important in 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.639
 the freestyle industry i have it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.520
 already mentioned at the beginning 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.740
 He needs that so often but he belongs 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.270
 Still to the simple tricks he's in 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.889
 get lost, there are the heavy and 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
 tricks but i can only do you as 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.610
 last tip give this 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.229
 to practice upward movement this is the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.080
 most important move and I say it 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.449
 always people exciting expensive feet on and 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.340
 make the line down when you get the 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.470
 makes movement and enjoy learning 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.960
 for the tus around the world and me 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.310
 hope for new clips thank you for 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.610

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.070
 I did not get any clips at all 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.500
 crossover is this week memorial man 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.199

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.990

 mention later 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.449
 and yes, as I said, it still uses the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.639
 clips are simply human being 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.400
