00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.090
 time for me a lot less time to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 much less time for bourgeois 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.629
 cola must offer videos but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.120
 a few moments to offer you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 if he can not really just like he 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 close but white plots 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.280
 so we end up today whose 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.330
 for the name xing tomorrow at berne 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.950
 so when we can see it I already 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.220
 opened his thoughts to as to a nice one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.250
 little complicated film and then 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 leaving the fact live at the shelter faye 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 so so reindeer more classic the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.549
 classical laburne 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 so here's against their fire stars 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:42.600
 so once you take that off you 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.320
 so have the box in the rally earth 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 from this box 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.110
 excuse me it's a bit of a mess 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 of tomatoes there is so it's true that a 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.740
 handicap boxing it's not easy to do 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 to a maneuver very quickly at casto 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:06.130
 so must be fed up byrne so 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:09.070
 I'm going to lift you here so I 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.410
 taken red and black classic and that's it 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.360
 so the palettes and red razer 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 I did not put stop trigger like we 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.070
 said i do not know i have not specially 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.240
 a hedge but not the gymnastics site 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.950
 ps3 that's good then it's gone wrong 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 movie is normal that after that it's a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 very funny as we could see I 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.830
 thought 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.990
 so here I find pretty pretty is in 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.510
 red and black this is one of his 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.130
 jailers 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.720
 I imagine sensations that is enough 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.410
 weird as at the beginning when intensive 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 and I go on the internet well at first 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.050
 very happy when we have trouble getting there 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.370
 do and then after we start to 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.300
 really harassment and that I had a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 tooth i told myself go there is and do 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.230
 jobs from everywhere and makes you 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.470
 it was useless so here is after 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.720
 once it's so good so I'm raging 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 a little bit of all that to life to do 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.520
 and we'll go to an ebook singh 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.690
 this thing here is the arnett two version 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.310
 blackhawk from i'm going to get her 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.040
 this morning we were born on the 13th of November and I 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.540
 could not see it in advance so I 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.220
 I'm going to do this all together 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.190
 same time that I still have not 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.930
 opened 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.750
 so as on the terminal the clash of the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.620
 because of editing and we end up 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.989
 with here is a very nice package we must 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.739
 die 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:38.350
 generally on one side I sense that 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:43.360
 the other name does not seem so then we 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.720
