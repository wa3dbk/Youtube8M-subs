Age<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.350> really

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
Age and I think that's a really

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.810 
Age and I think that's a really
interesting<00:01:04.619> ban<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> mean<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
interesting ban I mean I think that a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.510 
interesting ban I mean I think that a
lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.260> things<00:01:07.260> become<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.979> clone<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
lot of things become a bit clone like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
lot of things become a bit clone like
and<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.540> seems<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.380> identikit<00:01:12.020> sort<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and it seems to be an identikit sort of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
and it seems to be an identikit sort of
sound<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.650> look<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.130> performing<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
sound and look and we're performing I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310
