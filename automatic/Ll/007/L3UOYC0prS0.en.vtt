00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
beginners um it's very important to get

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.360 
beginners um it's very important to get
your<00:00:35.130> combo<00:00:35.520> style<00:00:36.470> because<00:00:37.470> combos<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
your combo style because combos is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.600 
your combo style because combos is
actually<00:00:39.620> for<00:00:40.620> every<00:00:40.860> character<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
actually for every character it's a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.330 
actually for every character it's a
necessity<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.720> like<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.770> cannot<00:00:44.100> miss

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
necessity it's like you cannot miss

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
necessity it's like you cannot miss
combos<00:00:44.820> especially<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> tournament

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
combos especially in like a tournament

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.439 
combos especially in like a tournament
situation<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> therefore<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> think

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
situation so therefore I think

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.760 
situation so therefore I think
practicing<00:00:49.199> training<00:00:49.650> mode<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
practicing training mode will be the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
practicing training mode will be the
best<00:00:52.770> way<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.850> learn<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.210> combos

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
best way to like learn your combos

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.850 
best way to like learn your combos
especially<00:00:55.290> bread<00:00:55.769> and<00:00:55.890> butters<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> also

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
especially bread and butters and also

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.829 
especially bread and butters and also
playing<00:00:59.190> against<00:00:59.820> people<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> computer

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
playing against people into a computer

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.030 
playing against people into a computer
is<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:01.409> important<00:01:01.860> because<00:01:03.710> every<00:01:04.710> player

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
is very important because every player

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.360 
is very important because every player
has<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> different<00:01:05.640> style<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.290> learning

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
has a different style and learning

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.710 
has a different style and learning
different<00:01:08.370> styles<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.180> opponents

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
different styles from your opponents

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.410 
different styles from your opponents
it's<00:01:09.870> very<00:01:10.080> important<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.820> in<00:01:11.820> ship<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it's very important also in ship at a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's very important also in ship at a
fork<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> technique<00:01:13.590> called<00:01:13.650> appeal

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
fork there's a technique called appeal

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.320 
fork there's a technique called appeal
inking<00:01:15.049> which<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> pressing<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> two

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
inking which is pressing like a two

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
inking which is pressing like a two
button<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.720> almost<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.260> same<00:01:19.470> time<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.010> then

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
button at almost the same time and then

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
button at almost the same time and then
you<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.990> three<00:01:21.990> inputs<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.960> by<00:01:24.960> learning

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you get a three inputs so by learning

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
you get a three inputs so by learning
this<00:01:25.380> technique<00:01:25.590> P<00:01:26.190> linking<00:01:26.670> its<00:01:26.850> I'll

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this technique P linking its I'll

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
this technique P linking its I'll
increase<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.350> chance<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:29.010> hitting<00:01:29.220> your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
increase your chance of hitting your

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000 
increase your chance of hitting your

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
combos so by P linking let's say Balrogs

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.640 
combos so by P linking let's say Balrogs

one frame link one frame Lincoln is very

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.100 
one frame link one frame Lincoln is very
difficult<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.910> execute<00:01:57.150> without<00:01:57.450> P<00:01:57.810> linking

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
difficult to execute without P linking

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.220 
difficult to execute without P linking
but<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.480> once<00:02:00.480> you<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.870> correct

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
but when you once you get the correct

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.150 
but when you once you get the correct
input<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.880> very<00:02:03.090> easy<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.070> be

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
input it's very easy and that can be

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.070

done through practicing training move of
course<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.539> also<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> think<00:02:10.200> joining

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
course and also I think joining

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.059 
course and also I think joining
tournaments<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:12.620> crucial<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.769> level

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
tournaments it's very crucial to level

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.259 
tournaments it's very crucial to level
up<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:15.060> help<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.780> level<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.140> because

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
up to help you level up because

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.640 
up to help you level up because
tournament<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> completely

different environment than casual play

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.580 
different environment than casual play
