00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 if my friends my name is Sergey love and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.540
 I'll show you one more interesting today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.379
 croft in toys kraft machines for now 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.080
 fighting 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.820
 aspects and playability I discuss not 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 I will because it is commonplace 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 I'll show you just what it looks like and what it can 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's go straight into construction mode and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 most interesting how he is here 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 compiled because our garage 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 limited in space but also people 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 who wish to build big 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.730
 statuettes I showed fully earlier 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.250
 often or at least in my videos 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 all sorts of Japanese dolls which where 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 more than the size of their place exactly 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.540
 here so do something through the joint and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 mounts which then fold out 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.760
 let's go test it you see 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 in fact, how it will be now 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.980
 happen that is first we have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.010
 Here is such a garbage 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.219
 we press the button of Christ's time and all 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 the trough is actually ready this ship 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.260
 and whether to change I do not know in the ships 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.750
 Strong as he correctly called the trough 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 can not be called because 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 he is creepy handsome you look at 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 detail that is, it has guns 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.890
 which of course turn and they 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 still able to rise and fall 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.759
 the truth is I sometimes have bugs and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 some functions stopped working 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.520
 You can of course broke off something there 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 inside broke but guys it all looks 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.079
 just awesome cool these antennas 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.450
 the coloring is cool done 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.090
 dark purple seemingly color with white 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 and here white is not loss of armor 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 just the colors he does not affect anything 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.250
 so cross and want to fly home take off 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 take off take off can this thing take off 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.229
 she's failing to shoot me 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.840
 naturally burst straight 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 can someone make it out easily but there is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.689
 one more function that I found not even 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.250
 immediately only when opened the window 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.250
 Buttons found this function I first pressed 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
 watch 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.380
 such a wave of the ship to pass but 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.349
 it helps to fly, oddly enough, I 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.880
 thought bills for bullshit happened as if 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.480
 the reactor is blasted 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.610
 in the ship inside what was it if you didn't 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.680
 let's understand again and ship again 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.080
 twists with us but he took off 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.450
 really after this explosion but but guys 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.650
 if you press one magic button b a 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.190
 by 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.160
 see how the parts move out 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.799
 crafting and now we see perfectly that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.769
 did this happen to us this gun 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.190
 anti-aircraft guns but which shoot high 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.590
 arc into the air that 's what it was for 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.930
 the explosion is getting into the body inside 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.000
 abell can again be closed well cool 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.370
 guys just pam looks fantastic 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.069
 if you compare again with robocraft 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.280
 He's a normal Kraft Warcraft 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.870
 a couple of hours you visit spend there 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.599
 evening 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.820
 Build something cool craft machines map 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.530
 It's a few days, that is, you spend 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.390
 3-4 days there and sometimes a week driving blocks 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 there is here a little twirled here 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.430
 unscrewed by adding features to it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.209
 make it as dense as possible 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.000
 functions 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.940
 using the lighthouse of the garage itself maxim 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.690
 opportunities to the maximum of everything so that he 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.310
 you and there ira evolved turning 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.100
 these are all 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 no yes not folded back is bent 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.579
 apparently stick on which is mounted back 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.519
 parts it won't fold I don't know 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.000
 why but there is such a bullshit I the first time 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.190
 when I went to play with this boat 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.510
 faced the same didn't want me 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.359
 take shape in any way 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.850
 back and all it does not open 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.310
 don't close these things start too 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.260
 believe but if at first do 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.870
 don't touch anything else 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.579
 the boat will be solid and not even 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.530
 undermining would not have thought that he 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.650
 consists of 3 parts actually 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.500
 if he had not seen them at all 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.930
 similar crafting is created in the game but I'm up 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.160
 This saw a robot that is tall 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.769
 he is sitting 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.960
 sat in this box in small for 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.760
 that 's why I was already a box 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 ready for how everything will be here 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.310
 implemented but cool cool of course 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.790
 it's all done with the generator it cost 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.090
 thousands of blocks insert shines which 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.040
 I don’t know why they are needed I don’t remember 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.270
 it will not help central blog because 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.430
 that the central unit is our mark 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.730
 not that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.710
 no tracer but Kor Kor blog about nothing 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.630
 put it do not give too she is looking 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.490
 flickers they want to stand frivolous 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.530
 there may already be a maximum of these simpletons 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.510
 blocks instructed the plan will not go 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.330
 in the details I'm in the cars map 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.550
 I do not understand much that is in the block 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.190
 here how to build them so cut there 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.979
 control of where to press buttons 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.960
 configure each feature i so 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.370
 more or less understand but I really 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.080
 not much sitting in the game and because he 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.479
 very much like early robocraft 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.550
 that is, there seems to be a concept to build 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.470
 You can even like health there is damage 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.300
 can be applied 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.490
 there is no game as such no one 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.910
 plays the author's typewriter in order to 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.430
 to shoot there boast well in battle 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.729
 to him the combat characteristics of the craft here 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.729
 only here are the sandbox people build 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:43.780
 something beautiful and everything proper as well 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.910
 how I build shitty enough so 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.860
 plus I don't really want to sit up straight 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.690
 the operation and there is no time trite 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.940
 therefore, and so I see that people build 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.180
 and here if guys want you too 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.160
 liked this ship them you want 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.440
 more ships well and generally craft 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.570
 interesting on my channel see then 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.160
 put more likes write comments 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.080
 I will try to choose something very 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.560
 Interestingly but the files then share 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.710
 You can in the game and just took the file downloaded and 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.720
 here actually showed that other people 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.169
 built and I myself would have built it 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.330
 probably eternity would be a whole even if 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.250
 my screenshots were exchanged for the whole day 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.940
 by sat by restoring as she is 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.040
 this 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.740
 the stuffing would not be able to repeat so 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.720
 we have built the author elegant general works 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.100
 Well, that's all guys write comments 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.100
 put the huskies see you
