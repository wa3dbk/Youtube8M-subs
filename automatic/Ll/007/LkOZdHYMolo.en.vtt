 father who taught the technique and today at 74 years of schooling that he learned from his children 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.890
 are invited by him to know the production process 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.219
 the cultivation of manioc 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.280
 beginning in November is twelve months until harvest with the typical dexterity of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.759
 man of the interior his francisco plant twigs cut this para-ray with 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.460
 a heavy one the sixth loaded of countries that have taken by the forest to small 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.360
 igarapé 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.940
 a part is put into the water for three days to provide the roots 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.570
 withdrawing the hydrocyanic acid from the other half is reserved in a 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.130
 more of united order until turning a mass tied 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 this mass will be surprised by the support of pp 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.910
 a white and venus liquid but that after having life becomes a 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.860
 very appreciated broth in the region the cassava that was in sauce is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.549
 peeled and placed in a wooden prey 'for one hour when it is 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.549
 dry mass can be first lady 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.290
 after stone the dough is ready to bake to make the flour 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 Yellow 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.020
 are producing 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.210
 the flour the avaí 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.119
 It's a flour that needs to be jammed. There's an instrument that's special. 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.660
 for this but in this case the craft production the net replaces the ball turns 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.919
 in the end 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:18.409
 2 this dough here you can realize is different on the yellow wall the flour the 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.319
 the most sought after and has higher market value in the clay 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.149
 again rewarded are 45 minutes lying of flour not to burn 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.989
 sometimes it gets there 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.989
 it was good for the country to leave home andré 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.079
 marry her 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.159
 you can not miss 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.409
 I'll grab talking to a friend. 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.509
 and this 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.750
 to have faith is one of the largest producers of amazon flour 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.410
 The product caters to the local market but most of it is sent to Mana- 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.480
 middlemen 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.530
 and it is they who determine the price 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.639
 the shooting gmc crossed the whole play 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.689
 and wanted to see these folks and for what cooperatives to be true 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.699
 cooperative they will have a shed for him explained that a part of the quota 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.699
 iran and the flour will leave here since I do not defend the continental advantage 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.269
 is this our concern of the municipality to get the middleman to move 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.729
 the eight thousand farmers in the tefé region produce about 24 thousand tons 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.330
 of flour per year 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.110
 but a project coordinated by the Institute of Agricultural Development of the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.340
 amazonas aims to increase advertising production 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.000
 without devastating larger areas of forest direct from the farm in the rural area to have 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.470
 faith in partnership with embrapa and the municipal government have faith developed 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.790
 work with cassava cultivation, this is an experimental unit that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.629
 difference is in the soil 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.580
 fertilizing 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.629
 is made differently 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.119
 increase production 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.829
 reduce environmental impacts 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.759
 the expectation is that it is that production increases is a production 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.529
 bigger 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.759
 and with less impact on the environment 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.099
 for sure 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.099
 here in work strips demonstrates what to do with this partnership 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.539
 is to increase production 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.479
 while some producers 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.989
 he arrived produces 12 tons of roots because they are here we are 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.279
 pretending the work we are doing 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.720
 we expect that this production will reach 24 parliamentarians 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.420
 the first results will only be known in November but the 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.970
 projections are encouraging with seven months of growth 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.040
 far greater than the traditional cultivation of Satan will stop in the market 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.629
 from the city center 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.550
 municipality also produces vegetables passion fruit papaya guava chestnut and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.099
 pineapple but the sales champion 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.960
 it's the same cassava flour 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.419
 has a rather strange technique to choose the best 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.909
 you win 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.370
 promise proof she was 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.840
 she went back to the water and the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.660
 at the fair to your user's home 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.120
 and it is his son who summarizes the importance of flour for 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.360
 amazonense where to become a lack in the middle of my boyfriend 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.490
 pt evaluates 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.830
 He has a bubble and the son lives in seclusion. 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.680
 the electoral register 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 my relative

 otavalo ecuador appears in the same neighborhood on Saturday 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.480
 the last report of the series b in the parts will show how the projects of 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.880
 professional qualification who changes the history of many dpf residents 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.120
