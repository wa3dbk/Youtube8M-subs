 saved all the spaces at the beginning are 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.140
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.150
 episode of the fundamental perks to mine 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 opinion on call of duty ghost 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 if you haven't seen the first one yet 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 episode I will leave you in description 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.199
 so maybe you pass us dates 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 take a look because I have already indicated 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 like the fundamental ones 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.689
 let's start immediately with others why 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
 advice that you can put them in the bars of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 basic or specialist if burke 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 used to be killing 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 the first is concealment allows us to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.309
 be invisible on the map to sarcomas 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 we will see ping rather than ping radar 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.030
 after 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.040
 isaac thomson po the equivalent of the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 places in the old call of duty so it is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.579
 the old killer the one who speaks to us 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.410
 already being the map island instead 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 when the enemy called a lot of places 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.969
 important for those who love to play 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 exteriors maybe playing with the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.550
 silencer 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.620
 this because they don't want to be 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.500
 discovered on the v map I recommend you 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 use concealment because why the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 jump are not really very common 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 another interesting interception that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 uses all the leaps but allies on the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 mini map whether they are allies or not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 let them be enemies if even the enemies 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.640
 they will call two sets like yours fa 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 nobody will call me nobody you can 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 enjoy a v and then this very 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 pasting it very often 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.380
 both in all against all since the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 sitecom is very used in this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
 game modes may be when they are 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 alone because maybe another team and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 with calling several satcoms and me 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 I can use them to exploit them to mine 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 advantage is not recommended to use it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 when you race you are playing the group with 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
 many friends and states closing the street 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 to stand on a flag that bends 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 point you know very well where i am 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.159
 enemies other because very important i 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 cv that allows us to recover our life 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.430
 much faster then if 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.479
 face a firefight and come 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 seriously injured 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 and here it is really easy to be hurt 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.750
 severely enough 12 shots to have a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.549
 noticeable lowering of life with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.439
 this is because the recovery faster 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 so we can face others 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.729
 clashes with enemies another classic 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.920
 for call of duty it is a magic trick 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 this needs no introduction 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.670
 because it allows us to recharge more 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 quickly very useful on le 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.479
 light machine guns and more generally 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 on all weapons enough the institution a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.640
 I usually just recharge it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.590
 about Italy 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.490
 light tractors on some two snipers 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.610
 because I use it very often with smg 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.110
 I'm marathon and agility agility and sick 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.090
 in the uses often combined because 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.100
 why sick or let me take a shot 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 unlimited so you can run without 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.690
 never stop agility instead increases the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.160
 my speed of movement therefore these 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.230
 I use them mainly with smg 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.360
 because I often run around the map 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.000
 with an assault rifle it is already less useful 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 because I tend to be slower 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.230
 check the map more, etc. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.000
 etc. aimed at established another for a long time 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.520
 used on the old colors of ci 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.769
 allows you to shoot more accurately 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.019
 when we are not aiming unknown is 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.760
 important to use it when when 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.890
 enemy story uses lots of sights 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.750
 thermal sensors come the tracers of 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.160
 movement because why this 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.810
 fur and between being invisible the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 Thermal viewfinder is very useful on this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.510
 call of duty and is widely used 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.700
 especially on assault rifles 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.440
 we will see then in the recommended classes one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.760
 nice class with the technician so if 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.130
 you see that the team to do uses 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.570
 very often you put the little technician 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.700
 of this lost invisible networks and 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.620
 you will send opponents into trouble 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.290
 2 because they relate to explosives are 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.150
 loose cannon that increases damage from 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.950
 explosives I don't use very often 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.420
 because the grenades are not mine 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.370
 however you prefer it is really useful 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.860
 You will truly do exceptional damage 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.860
 with grenades and armored shield which 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.600
 instead it halves the damage 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.790
 received from explosives very useful for 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.160
 counter the regional explosive that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.720
 really devastating ping is a new one 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.200
 because introduced in this color digos 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.750
 allows us to release an impulse 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.970
 sÃ²nar on the mini map that reveals the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.070
 enemies in our area near when 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.690
 we mention enemy this is a very bar 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.269
 useful because we take the case that we 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.739
 we're shooting enemy then kill him 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.810
 behind a wall there is another friend ready 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.519
 waiting for us with pins when there 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.930
 we will tell the first enemy we will reveal it 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.570
 position of the other on the mini map 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.810
 attention however as I said before if the 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.950
 enemy to concealment will not be detected 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810
 on the map 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.209
 I close with the last loser I wanted 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.160
 speak to you in the perfect center which is one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.680
 new entry this century even more 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.959
 of 5 points therefore quite heavy from 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.789
 insert small note is not power 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.160
 arrest thus does not increase the damage 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.019
 of the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.520
 but what does it do based on the number of 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.080
 consecutive killings we do 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.750
 increases the likelihood of doing damage 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.210
 critical therefore more Chilean row we do 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.460
 up to 5 exits in a row that the dan has 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.130
 probability masses in 40 50 recent funds 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.110
 the most critical year we have the more we have 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.750
 possibility of doing this damage then 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.140
 where I recommend you use this 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.760
 for os classes with weapons that have little 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.370
 damage because it can be very useful or 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.710
 with smg that have a large breeds of 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.330
 fire because more shots we shoot 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.490
 the more we have the chance to do this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.530
 critical damage where I do not recommend 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.390
 this for surely yes rifles from 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.130
 sniper because they already have another damage 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.080
 on semi-automatic rifles because 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.510
 we totally shoot a few shots that is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.830
 difficult to get a critical hit 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.450
 with perfect center 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.070
 be careful even if we put it on 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.420
 specialist we will have to start from scratch 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.040
 pines and it's not that if we unlock it where 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.350
 having made 13 kills row we leave 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.740
 already with the maximum probability will start 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.200
 always from zero with today we have concluded 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.040
 any mine because I consider myself 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.080
 indispensable from which use up 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.880
 specialist or in basic specialties 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.620
 tell me which ones are yours 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.360
 used more we will see you soon 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.160
 put a video like a comment 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.170
 entered in the channel passed to the bather 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.180
 which you find description to stay with 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.460
 we will see you soon with the classes 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.460
 recommended discolored bye all
