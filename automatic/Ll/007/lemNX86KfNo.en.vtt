00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.850
 to get reinforcements 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.340
 recognize one of those gentlemen 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.060
 as well 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.689
 youtube and good as you will see I will talk to you 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.970
 about the supposed death of optimus 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.859
 prime really we almost do not know what 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.410
 will happen with optimus in the fifth movie 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.480
 of transformers some say no 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.640
 will die and others say yes fuck those 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.650
 they are crazy I say no but good if 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.480
 will die this great character will not be what 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.430
 same and good I will tell you my supposed 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 opinion what will happen with optimus in 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.620
 Transformers 5 at first we already know that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.720
 prime went on transformers 4 because he 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.579
 I did not want that they would not destroy the planet 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.590
 earth but apart from that he went to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.899
 look for their creators but generally 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 he went to look for them but what will it be for 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.769
 fight with them and well maybe it will be 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.809
 a great fight and good another thing that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.330
 they will destroy your planet that is cybertron 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.009
 but really because Optimus Prime is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.170
 it was from planet earth I just say that 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.910
 prime risks a lot no but something 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.979
 curious is that in the animation of 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.899
 transformers the creators of prime not 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.910
 they wanted only because they wanted to destroy the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.369
 leadership matrix and good I feel that 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.320
 something like this will happen in transformers 5 but 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.460
 yes it will be the death of optimus prime who 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.550
 will take the leadership 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.130
 maybe it will be hot rod ultra magnus 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.080
 sad is confusing who will be the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 new leader of the autobots but good 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.010
 It will take time about who will be the new 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.230
 leader aaaa is spinning me the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.270
 head over what will happen to prime but 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.700
 good just wait a year about what 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.620
 will happen in transformers 5 and good but if 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.510
 that death of optimus that is something 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.880
 incredible I do not know I just say it 's 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.590
 something magnificent the last prime fight 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.020
 that is something beautiful that makes you feel 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 the emotion xd I hope that the last 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.280
 battle of the great leader of the autobots 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.090
 be like the battle of transformers 3 in 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.830
 serious this battle I almost cried xd xd 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 xddddd or also a farewell as in 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.660
 prime transformers that would be great and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.730
 at the same time beautiful xd but good is not yet 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.740
 sure it 's the death of prime but 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.990
 you just have to wait for fuck I hope not 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.460
 be his death if I do not start crying or 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.740
 No, but it will not be the same. 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.480
 optimus prime but another curiosity is 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.460
 that prime die many times 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.680
 there will really be a return of optimus 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.650
 prime or its end will only take time 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.750
 wait for my head it explodes to ok not but 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.790
 there are many things to find out and good 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.739
