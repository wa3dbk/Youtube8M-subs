00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.710

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.650
 by the way, it looks like an aston martin 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.180
 OK 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 Well, we continue to video new 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.900

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.079
 the series looks like 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.450
 so even though it’s very similar, I don’t know 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.100
 By the way, the drive can be seen that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.830
 very similar to the business class model 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 shorter but sometimes washed frankly 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.920

 sitting and just sat in it 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.790
