00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.130 
other day so I've got the eagle eye
thing<00:04:02.739> with<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:02.950> now<00:04:03.070> 64<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.150> age<00:04:04.239> it's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
thing with you now 64 and age it's

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.720 
thing with you now 64 and age it's
pretty<00:04:05.410> expensive<00:04:05.650> at<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.010> moment<00:04:06.280> I'm<00:04:06.400> gonna

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
pretty expensive at the moment I'm gonna

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.130 
pretty expensive at the moment I'm gonna
spend<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.269> range<00:04:07.450> rather<00:04:07.750> than<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.989> mage

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
spend it on range rather than the mage

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.560 
spend it on range rather than the mage
so<00:04:08.890> that's<00:04:09.070> sort<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.610> up<00:04:09.760> slowly<00:04:10.180> honest

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
so that's sort of going up slowly honest

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.080 
so that's sort of going up slowly honest
and<00:04:10.870> slowly<00:04:11.380> but<00:04:11.530> surely<00:04:11.940> eventually<00:04:12.940> i'll<00:04:13.000> be

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
and slowly but surely eventually i'll be

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
and slowly but surely eventually i'll be
getting<00:04:13.180> 94<00:04:13.690> obviously<00:04:14.350> when<00:04:14.440> i<00:04:14.500> had<00:04:14.620> the
