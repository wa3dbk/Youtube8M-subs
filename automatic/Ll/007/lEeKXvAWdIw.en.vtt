Godzilla Saurus which eventually becomes
Godzilla<00:01:09.479> through<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> nuclear<00:01:10.500> testing<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
Godzilla through the nuclear testing and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
Godzilla through the nuclear testing and
it<00:01:12.570> raised<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> from<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.040> rid<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it raised it from time and get rid of it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
it raised it from time and get rid of it
so<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> did<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> time

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
they raised it from time that way by

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
they raised it from time that way by
moving<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.619> position<00:01:47.070> where<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
moving it from the position where it is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.170 
moving it from the position where it is
and<00:01:48.560> moving<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> somewhere<00:01:49.860> else<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and moving it somewhere else so the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910 
and moving it somewhere else so the
nuclear<00:01:51.570> testing<00:01:51.930> didn't<00:01:52.229> affect<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> diary

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
nuclear testing didn't affect the diary

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
nuclear testing didn't affect the diary
dinosaur<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:54.149> turned<00:01:54.420> into<00:01:54.570> Godzilla<00:01:54.840> in

when<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.390> nuclear<00:02:12.780> testing<00:02:13.170> does<00:02:13.350> go<00:02:13.530> off

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
when the nuclear testing does go off

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.670 
when the nuclear testing does go off
these<00:02:14.550> creatures<00:02:15.120> eventually<00:02:15.960> become<00:02:16.260> King

Ghidorah<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> future<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.290> we've<00:02:19.440> got<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
Ghidorah in the future and we've got the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.620 
Ghidorah in the future and we've got the
wrong<00:02:19.980> way<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.940> turns<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
wrong way now it turns out the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.810 
wrong way now it turns out the
futuristic<00:02:22.200> people<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> bad<00:02:22.920> guys<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
futuristic people are the bad guys and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.530 
futuristic people are the bad guys and
they<00:02:24.090> want<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:25.220> take<00:02:26.220> over<00:02:26.430> Tokyo<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.420> was

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
they want to take over Tokyo and I was

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
they want to take over Tokyo and I was
thin<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:31.410> other<00:02:31.590> plot<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:32.010> vowels

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
thin and so the other plot have vowels

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.900 
thin and so the other plot have vowels
around<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.540> bring<00:02:33.920> bringing<00:02:34.920> Godzilla<00:02:35.610> back

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
around to bring bringing Godzilla back

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.190 
around to bring bringing Godzilla back
by<00:02:36.870> nuke<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:39.500> by<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.990> forget<00:02:42.990> already

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
by nuke in by is I forget already

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.160 
by nuke in by is I forget already
Godzilla<00:02:43.709> comes<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.190> actually<00:02:44.459> because

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
Godzilla comes back actually because

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.720 
Godzilla comes back actually because
basically<00:02:46.170> constantly<00:02:46.770> doesn't<00:02:47.160> equate<00:02:47.430> back

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
basically constantly doesn't equate back

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.520 
basically constantly doesn't equate back
because<00:02:48.300> he<00:02:48.420> absorbs<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> nuclear<00:02:49.260> submarine

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
because he absorbs a nuclear submarine

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.460 
because he absorbs a nuclear submarine
and<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:51.030> ends<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.330> coming<00:02:51.570> back<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:52.290> take
