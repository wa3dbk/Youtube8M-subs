00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.870
 the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.239
 Hello dear garden friends 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.390
 today are in the mountains of Evelyn Walter Roth in Ettenheimmünster 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.159
 Mrs. Roth 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.379
 you guessed what big terrain here is how big your garden is furnished 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 when he with Forefront with the house purchase 2600 square meters 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.780
 if you leave it from SID who the garden I go to now 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.000
 two to 2200 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.460
 sqm 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.050
 Steep slope garden 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.909
 maybe they can count a bit more like them all the time 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.019
 Bottom then are like this year we are 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.290
 we bought the house in 2002 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.140
 and then have first 40 to 50 trees like it that house grown-up with 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 Blackberries and scrub 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.210
 and then he tried to make it two long terrain accessible 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.830
 and 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.770
 We started tanning 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 that means that I would say we take them once more now 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.660
 all make a tour in the Cup and the very close to 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.780
 if you go from the specifications to the main course as you come on a path to this 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 to want new water basin 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.440
 Red how did they come up with the idea to build up the walls as water basins 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.680
 and not just classic 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 we are still living in the earth and in the pond to create yes here you can 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.610
 not deep round while meanwhile the spot most conspicuous 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.720
 and then we were in England last year and have wedding guests 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.980
 and then that was the idea for our garden so we stand before now 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.920
 the arcade 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 Maybe we can just say how they interact with the garden design 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.370
 started like this 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.850
 as the first one more 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.030
 here made the staircase and a connection from the east side of the garden 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 to the west side 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.480
 if he now sees through the arcade 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.890
 was that our first way in 2002 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.230
 since I am not a professional 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.780
 the design with questions 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.890
 I tried so I divided the whole garden areas in color 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.169
 here yellow purified sample is a blue whale, after all 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.169
 now where SPD and the countries 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.459
 and that's how I am 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.439
 slowly 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.299
 ventured forward and expanded my knowledge we sit here to the blue 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.099
 trembles 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.200
 who is not so easy to get used to the idea right now 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.409
 individually to the stage 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.479
 Minute harmonize with each other 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.859
 With that you would have selected the doctors in the area 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.209
 br in the spring it is quite easy there is that forget-me-not there 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.499
 turns itself off and gives me wonderful Glauber color 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.619
 then the Steelers and I even have some blue toilets 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.329
 In the summer I decided to guarantee no more guarantee as a main stage 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.809
 yes there are pucks time and the magnificat open 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.959
 And now in the fall, of course, there are many blue Osborne this fall 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.959
 with their prosthetic Bahir plants they have then combined in one or something 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.359
 There was the idea behind the design 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.559
 yes that she would have noticed you no he has Red 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.559
 and of course that includes Astana ranks and Christa 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.949
 this is also the first beta I deviate from the color design here 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.359
 So there was and only Ostermann flower 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.729
 I like the asters as he likes to have great colors 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.729
 and because these are in different sizes in the country so beautiful heights 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.749
 staggered can make popular 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.470
 Besides, it's just great in the fall 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.289
 once again 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.849
 Yaris's garden is adopted with such a fireworks driveways 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.159
 Holy water with our values ​​wants their formal land 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.389
 Yeah, I'm a reflection. It's a long walk 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.539
 and every plant she planted - she said I also planted on the right 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:47.750
 he is everything as always 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.189
 same and the new are the same 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.190
 Everything in the design should be so tall and filigree 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.540
 that is an over the head growing always true sense of the word so now 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.259
 should 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.989
 can go through times 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.889
 like a child through more flowers this 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.519
 Locally this Laurie he certainly will be one of the favorite places or 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.679
 Yes, in any case 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:13.789
 This allowed to be made when the small midday rest did not come here 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:17.769
 Isele retire in the summer when it's really hot my husband built it 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.460
 with old bricks keep up with plain tiles and I think it is 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.569
 become a real gem 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.400
 Brodersen's new senses reveal how they manage what they are looking forward to 

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.490
 loving plant coercion or even the knotweed 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.990
 that these and dried to be cleared the Hang Seng beds laid out 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.080
 It's all set up like anti aging 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.229
 only that she had no water trainees but he had 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.909
 and the readers university hospital waterproof but by which personal that 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.350
 too much water can drain but the earth is always good with water 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.680
 soaked 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.479
 and percent the plants then quite so round 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.650

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.740
