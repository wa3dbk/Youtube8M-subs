00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.190
 I give it on training and models 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.170
 at the start in the models but also 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.240
 seasoned models boys girls 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.369
 actually I think for ten years 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.950
 since that is actually a non-verbal one 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.200
 communication training 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.910
 hidden in the catwalk training I am 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.610
 started giving cattle training then 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.410
 we actually fashion week in Amsterdam 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.970
 after its first edition because the question is at 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.559
 me can back from you runs so well and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 so long 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.620
 and all those girls here who get there 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.640
 not being guided you can't do a bit 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.290
 help out 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 and then I literally got that way 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.220
 done with my finger in the air and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.680
 I started thinking of what I important 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.600
 During my own time what models 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.579
 really is the basis of the good catwalk 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.880
 walk with the I came to the discovery 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.680
 so non-verbal communication 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.210
 You radiate is actually who are you and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.309
 what makes you you 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.930
 that makes them different from your neighbor and 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.879
 that can embrace a line below that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.809
 put that actually it 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.809
 main ingredient 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.890
 I have my first training cache with 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.530
 That was a lot of fun 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 14 years and I got the edges with her 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.549
 get a hangover workout what for 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.229
 very important to me was that i 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.119
 really my first you walk a bit 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.920
 could develop 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.140
 after that it's just a lot 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.729
 practice and gain experience Forum 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.740
 abroad 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.360
 making you just better at it 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.490
 being specified with being received as well 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.899
 really very much your thing and I went there 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.700
 a little bit known for me too 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.789
 really good catwalk walk i saw it myself 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.409
 not yet but to all responses 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.310
 yes it turned out to be a kind of 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.310
 talents are you 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.800
 and then the work is perhaps the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 boss is and directions model nothing in 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.490
 residential area it's not about us 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.460
 goodie bag owns very nice goodies 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 like heels and the soles actually 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.810
 everything a model needs to him 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 to carry in a travel bag 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.420
 but it is mainly the catwalk training 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.640
 twice in the form of learning 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 yourself discovering the piece 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.980
 psychology but also casting 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.660
 therefore the technology of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 walking the catwalk make technique from it 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 pass in combination with nutrition the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.560
 proper guidance and education level 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 when i ran into michelle i was 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.190
 were no longer alone with 2 and then see 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.830
 from then I would really like to see if 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.110
 together we can provide to you 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.040
 moodle work too 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 to become a reality 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.910
 as I already told you, I am also my 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.100
 14 law started modeling so 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.140
 then you already pay attention that you are 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.940
 Cakes eat parties because you don't have any 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 opens up bags of chips 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.100
 is just a little healthier and more aware already 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.390
 are going to eat but you are only 14 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.070
 yes that will continue for quite a while 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.150
 until that giving up it really went full time 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.180
 work and then it suddenly becomes whole 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.540
 other biscuits still you're much more aware 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.330
 pay attention 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.130
 and you also need to get a little thinner 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.040
 really have to be able to work full time 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.570
 I had to get a little thinner in lies 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.160
 and that has crept very slowly 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.620
 and that went very well that 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.540
 give up actually going too far and me 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.130
 on size 85 I and I ended up 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.390
 don't follow my brother paris yet 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 not enough as i will always be with you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.100
 continue to have and it just me 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.350
 really very much you handled a button 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.050
 and the help I need at that moment 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.090
 was not offered to me, so I 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.460
 actually decided for myself 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.140
 girls who would give him the same position 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.920
 to help them and to 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.750
 can guide 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.420
 hence i also study like 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.430
 nutritionist I have followed and now 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.680
 also give real nutritional guidance 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.170
 models also not models but that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.060
 I will come from the modeling world 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.560
 there really my interest out 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.720
 so now also on a catwalk 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.209
 training training carteling wrote that 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.830
 ins and outs about great tips 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.830
 I make very healthy recipes 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.180
 because a very nice and educational day is fun 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.740
 to talk to people about 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.000
 yes stuff when i put it on training and 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.100
 food 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.109
 mental support of models i 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.530
 found it quite difficult to do it yourself 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.390
 walk 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 it is very new because that is 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.070
 of course not my profession but nice 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.640
 to experience what what your model 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.640
 also experience
