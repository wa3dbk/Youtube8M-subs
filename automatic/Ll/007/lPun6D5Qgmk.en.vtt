00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
palm tree here the way I built the palm

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.099 
palm tree here the way I built the palm
tree<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:27.240> took<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.080> bunch<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:30.109> brown

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
tree is I took a bunch of these brown

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.729 
tree is I took a bunch of these brown
two<00:00:31.590> by<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:31.800> cylindrical<00:00:32.399> bricks<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.739> just

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
two by two cylindrical bricks and just

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
two by two cylindrical bricks and just
stack<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.219> top<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> each<00:00:35.640> other<00:00:35.820> but

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
stack them on top of each other but

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.760 
stack them on top of each other but
you'll<00:00:36.780> notice<00:00:36.930> they're<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.380> stacked

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you'll notice they're not stacked

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.130 
you'll notice they're not stacked
completely<00:00:38.520> straight<00:00:38.850> there's<00:00:39.570> slightly

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
completely straight there's slightly

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.459 
completely straight there's slightly
slightly<00:00:43.140> off<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.120> end<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.170> gives<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
slightly off on one end so it gives it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.610 
slightly off on one end so it gives it
the<00:00:46.620> curving<00:00:46.980> effect<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.079> then<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> top<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the curving effect and then the top I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.139 
the curving effect and then the top I
just<00:00:49.770> took<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> bunch<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> green<00:00:50.520> bricks<00:00:50.789> or

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
just took a bunch of green bricks or

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
just took a bunch of green bricks or
plates<00:00:51.780> rather<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.440> try<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
plates rather and try to make it into a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.020 
plates rather and try to make it into a
nice<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.390> tree<00:00:54.809> shape<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
nice little tree shape I don't have the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
nice little tree shape I don't have the
pieces<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:57.960> actual<00:00:58.289> palm<00:00:58.980> tree<00:00:59.370> i<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.520> i

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
pieces for an actual palm tree i think i

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.009 
pieces for an actual palm tree i think i
have<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> few<00:01:00.449> leaf<00:01:01.440> pieces<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:03.019> pretty

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have like a few leaf pieces and pretty

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.359 
have like a few leaf pieces and pretty
sure<00:01:04.170> i<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.299> tree<00:01:06.299> trunk<00:01:06.570> itself

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
sure i don't have the tree trunk itself

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.530 
sure i don't have the tree trunk itself
but<00:01:08.369> I've<00:01:08.610> always<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> wanted<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.390> make

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
but I've always kind of wanted to make

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
but I've always kind of wanted to make
one<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.860> turned<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.159> pretty

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
one and I think it turned out pretty

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.990 
one and I think it turned out pretty
nicely<00:01:12.619> actually<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> make<00:01:14.880> your

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
nicely actually if you want to make your

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.960 
nicely actually if you want to make your
own<00:01:15.770> something<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.040> half<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> pieces<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
own something like half the pieces I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.810 
own something like half the pieces I
used<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.479> came<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.580> raft

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
used for this came from the little raft

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
used for this came from the little raft
set<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> pirates<00:01:22.170> theme<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
set from the pirates theme that was I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
set from the pirates theme that was I
know<00:01:24.000> 23<00:01:24.540> years<00:01:24.750> ago<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:26.360> doubt<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.600> still

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
know 23 years ago I doubt it's still

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
know 23 years ago I doubt it's still
available<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.680> legos<00:01:29.070> website<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
available from legos website now and we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
available from legos website now and we
can<00:01:30.180> probably<00:01:30.479> still<00:01:30.630> find<00:01:30.930> online<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.700> decent

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can probably still find online a decent

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
can probably still find online a decent
price<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.240> what's<00:01:33.509> left<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> raft<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
price this is what's left of the raft a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.640 
price this is what's left of the raft a
lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.220> brown<00:01:35.909> pieces<00:01:36.180> were<00:01:37.079> used<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lot of these brown pieces were used and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.219 
lot of these brown pieces were used and
you<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> plates<00:01:38.570> force<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.079> if

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you could use the plates force and if

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.569 
you could use the plates force and if
you<00:01:40.320> wanted<00:01:40.619> though<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> happen<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
you wanted though I happen to have a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.889 
you wanted though I happen to have a
bunch<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> those<00:01:42.240> lying<00:01:43.049> around<00:01:43.170> anyway<00:01:44.899> well

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
bunch of those lying around anyway well

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
bunch of those lying around anyway well
then<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> guess<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.430> if

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
then I guess that's about it then so if

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
then I guess that's about it then so if
you<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:47.970> video<00:01:48.119> please<00:01:48.299> rate<00:01:49.290> comment
