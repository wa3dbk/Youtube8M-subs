well it's been about a month since I
hide<00:00:07.940> these<00:00:08.240> bees<00:00:08.510> some

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
hide these bees some

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.130 
hide these bees some
to<00:00:10.209> expand<00:00:10.780> the<00:00:10.809> beef

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
to expand the beef

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.940 
to expand the beef
and<00:00:12.320> add<00:00:12.590> an<00:00:13.010> upper<00:00:13.250> deep

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
and add an upper deep

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.980 
and add an upper deep
this<00:00:15.520> upper<00:00:15.790> deep<00:00:16.000> is<00:00:16.270> he<00:00:16.590> exact<00:00:17.590> same<00:00:17.830> box

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this upper deep is he exact same box

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.220 
this upper deep is he exact same box
dimensions<00:00:19.990> is<00:00:20.230> this<00:00:20.770> lower<00:00:21.130> deep<00:00:21.630> has<00:00:22.630> ten

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
dimensions is this lower deep has ten

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.860 
dimensions is this lower deep has ten
frames

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
frames

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.690 
frames
each<00:00:26.500> frame<00:00:26.800> has<00:00:27.690> beeswax<00:00:28.690> foundation<00:00:29.320> on<00:00:29.500> it

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
each frame has beeswax foundation on it

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.010 
each frame has beeswax foundation on it
so<00:00:30.700> this<00:00:30.820> is<00:00:31.000> going<00:00:31.120> to<00:00:31.180> give<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.570> bees<00:00:31.750> room

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
so this is going to give the bees room

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:41.300 
so this is going to give the bees room
to<00:00:32.200> expand

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.270

day now at a rate of up to two thousand
a<00:01:14.170> day<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.970> if<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.479> don't<00:01:17.290> get<00:01:17.649> this<00:01:17.830> up<00:01:18.100> or<00:01:18.280> deep

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
a day so if I don't get this up or deep

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.529 
a day so if I don't get this up or deep
put<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.630> bees<00:01:20.429> may<00:01:21.429> decide<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:21.970> this

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
put on the bees may decide that this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.260 
put on the bees may decide that this
hive<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.410> too<00:01:23.619> small<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.009> them<00:01:24.399> pick<00:01:24.820> up<00:01:25.030> and

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
hive is too small for them pick up and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.520 
hive is too small for them pick up and
swarm<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.340> try<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.399> find<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.850> new<00:01:28.000> hive

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:43.190 

I<00:01:33.780> found<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> Queen<00:01:36.570> she's<00:01:37.570> right<00:01:37.810> there

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
so you can watch her hopefully she's
going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> deposit<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.790> egg<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.210> any<00:01:48.390> second

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
going to deposit an egg here any second

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:58.680 
going to deposit an egg here any second
now<00:01:48.900> is<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.230

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
there she goes she just put an egg in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.000 
there she goes she just put an egg in
that<00:02:01.270> cell<00:02:03.960> she<00:02:04.960> should<00:02:05.170> do<00:02:05.290> one<00:02:05.470> about<00:02:05.710> every

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
that cell she should do one about every

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.680 
that cell she should do one about every
ten<00:02:06.220> seconds<00:02:08.640> okay<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:10.150> she<00:02:10.360> goes<00:02:10.510> with

another<00:02:11.020> one<00:02:12.870> we'll<00:02:13.870> treat<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.350> bottom<00:02:14.860> deep

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
another one we'll treat the bottom deep

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.070 
another one we'll treat the bottom deep
as<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:17.170> nursery<00:02:17.830> where<00:02:18.580> they're<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.080> just

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
upper deep or food chamber will be

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.600 
upper deep or food chamber will be
treated<00:02:26.590> as<00:02:26.680> pantry<00:02:27.280> where<00:02:27.550> they're<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:28.090> to
