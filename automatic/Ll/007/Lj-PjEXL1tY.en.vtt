and at the same time it was supposed to
be<00:00:50.340> cropped<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> still<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.230> crop

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
that they just look so minimalistic I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.490 
that they just look so minimalistic I
just<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.510> seen<00:03:47.750> anything<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.290> these

14<00:03:51.500> pounds<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:51.980> quite<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.220> good<00:03:52.459> price<00:03:52.730> for

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
these really because I do think I'll be

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.110

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
getting a lot of yourself that's the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.910

next<00:03:56.360> pair<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.540> shoes<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.930> got<00:03:56.959> again<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.709> think

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
next pair of shoes I got again I think

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.650 
next pair of shoes I got again I think
they<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.370> quite<00:03:58.640> similar<00:03:59.000> these<00:03:59.239> ones<00:03:59.480> are

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.310 
lot more nicer as well and also I don't

do have like pageant right here which I
don't<00:04:27.780> know<00:04:28.050> why<00:04:28.230> because<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.710> other<00:04:28.860> ones

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
don't know why because the other ones

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.800 
don't know why because the other ones
don't<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.910> aren't<00:04:30.300> there<00:04:30.419> laws<00:04:30.630> are

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
don't have that aren't there laws are

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.630 
don't have that aren't there laws are
more<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.139> he'll<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.950> yeah<00:04:32.130> they<00:04:32.310> just<00:04:32.520> are

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
more of it he'll but yeah they just are

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.790 
more of it he'll but yeah they just are
really<00:04:32.820> comfortable<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.690> wear<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.470> really

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
really comfortable to wear and I really

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.260 
really comfortable to wear and I really
can't<00:04:35.130> wait<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.430> wear<00:04:35.550> these<00:04:35.730> because<00:04:35.940> I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
can't wait to wear these because I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.670 
can't wait to wear these because I
definitely<00:04:36.750> think<00:04:37.020> they're<00:04:37.350> going<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> be

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
definitely think they're going to be

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.920 
definitely think they're going to be
like<00:04:37.830> my<00:04:38.010> go-to<00:04:38.250> everyday<00:04:39.090> pair<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.480> shoes<00:04:39.720> to

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
like my go-to everyday pair of shoes to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.570 
like my go-to everyday pair of shoes to
work<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.560> issues<00:04:40.800> were<00:04:40.919> actually<00:04:41.280> 12

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
work and the issues were actually 12

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.190 
work and the issues were actually 12
pounds<00:04:42.090> which<00:04:42.240> are<00:04:42.390> two<00:04:42.540> parts<00:04:42.720> cheaper<00:04:43.110> than

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
pounds which are two parts cheaper than

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.409 
pounds which are two parts cheaper than
the<00:04:43.260> other<00:04:43.560> ones<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:43.890> well<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.520> 12<00:04:44.820> pounds<00:04:45.300> I

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
the other ones as well the 12 pounds I

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.390 
the other ones as well the 12 pounds I
really<00:04:45.750> think<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.350> can't<00:04:46.650> go<00:04:46.740> wrong<00:04:47.040> with

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
really think you can't go wrong with

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.850 
really think you can't go wrong with
like<00:04:47.550> such<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> nice<00:04:48.270> everyday<00:04:48.960> sandals<00:04:49.710> who<00:04:49.830> I

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
like such a nice everyday sandals who I

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.130 
like such a nice everyday sandals who I
know<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> next<00:04:50.580> thing<00:04:50.730> now<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.240> probably<00:04:51.450> what

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
know the next thing now is probably what

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.960 
know the next thing now is probably what
I<00:04:52.169> think<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.770> most<00:04:52.890> appropriate<00:04:53.310> for<00:04:53.640> like

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
I think is the most appropriate for like

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.550 
I think is the most appropriate for like
the<00:04:54.120> springtime<00:04:54.690> weather<00:04:54.870> as<00:04:55.110> it's<00:04:55.350> still

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
the springtime weather as it's still

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.640 
the springtime weather as it's still
quite<00:04:55.860> cold<00:04:55.890> really<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.880> is<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:57.900> coat<00:04:58.350> here

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
quite cold really and is this coat here

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.680 
quite cold really and is this coat here
but<00:04:59.040> how<00:04:59.160> could<00:04:59.340> i<00:04:59.460> hunger<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.419> see<00:05:00.660> a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
but how could i hunger so you can see a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.050 
but how could i hunger so you can see a
little<00:05:01.050> bit<00:05:01.169> better<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.740> what<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.639> is<00:05:02.910> this

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
little bit better and what it is is this

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.909 
little bit better and what it is is this
cream<00:05:03.419> coat<00:05:03.720> it's<00:05:03.900> not<00:05:04.140> white<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.470> think<00:05:04.860> it

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
cream coat it's not white I think it

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.860 
cream coat it's not white I think it
probably<00:05:05.250> comes<00:05:05.820> off<00:05:06.060> kind<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.419> white<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:06.780> the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
probably comes off kind of white in the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.900 
probably comes off kind of white in the
comment<00:05:07.229> but<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.470> not<00:05:07.620> wire<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:08.100> cream<00:05:08.580> so<00:05:08.880> it

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
comment but it's not wire is cream so it

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.240 
comment but it's not wire is cream so it
is<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.390> very<00:05:09.810> easy<00:05:10.140> color<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.770> wear<00:05:10.919> and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
is like a very easy color to wear and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.950 
is like a very easy color to wear and
just<00:05:11.430> love<00:05:11.580> how<00:05:11.760> it's<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.060> simple<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.720> felt

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
just love how it's so simple and felt

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.260 
just love how it's so simple and felt
like<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.169> housing<00:05:13.680> no<00:05:14.190> Carla<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.850> then<00:05:15.030> all<00:05:15.240> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
like a housing no Carla and then all the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.779 
like a housing no Carla and then all the
way<00:05:15.390> down<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:16.080> just<00:05:16.350> plain<00:05:16.680> just<00:05:17.100> like<00:05:17.310> one

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
way down it's just plain just like one

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.670 
way down it's just plain just like one
plane<00:05:18.120> zip<00:05:18.479> and<00:05:18.720> then<00:05:18.810> also<00:05:19.020> like<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.470> zip

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
plane zip and then also like the zip

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.260 
plane zip and then also like the zip
pockets<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:20.430> well<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:20.760> think<00:05:21.030> they're

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
pockets as well I just think they're

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.930 
pockets as well I just think they're
like<00:05:21.450> such<00:05:22.050> minimal<00:05:22.590> details<00:05:23.039> that<00:05:23.610> just<00:05:23.760> make

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
like such minimal details that just make

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.850 
like such minimal details that just make
it<00:05:23.970> really<00:05:24.120> nice<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:25.200> material<00:05:25.710> this

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
it really nice and the material this

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.219 
it really nice and the material this
feels<00:05:26.220> kind<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.640> like<00:05:26.700> scuba<00:05:27.300> material<00:05:27.419> so

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
feels kind of like scuba material so

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.840 
feels kind of like scuba material so
it's<00:05:28.410> definitely<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:28.979> a<00:05:29.010> material<00:05:29.640> that<00:05:29.729> is

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
it's definitely like a material that is

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.610 
it's definitely like a material that is
perfect<00:05:30.419> for<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.720> weather<00:05:30.750> coming<00:05:31.200> up<00:05:31.410> as

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
perfect for the weather coming up as

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.590 
perfect for the weather coming up as
well<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:32.400> definitely<00:05:32.850> think<00:05:33.180> I'm<00:05:33.360> gonna<00:05:33.450> be

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
well so I definitely think I'm gonna be

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.480 
well so I definitely think I'm gonna be
getting<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.900> lot<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.140> use<00:05:34.410> out<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.220> I

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
getting a lot of use out of this and I

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.520 
getting a lot of use out of this and I
yeah<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.850> absolutely<00:05:36.419> love<00:05:36.660> this<00:05:36.840> when<00:05:37.200> I<00:05:37.229> was

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
yeah I absolutely love this when I was

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.200 
yeah I absolutely love this when I was
looking<00:05:37.800> at<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:38.010> my<00:05:38.190> sister<00:05:38.550> came<00:05:38.760> over<00:05:39.060> and

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
looking at that my sister came over and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.969 
looking at that my sister came over and
in<00:05:39.330> fact<00:05:39.479> she<00:05:39.750> really<00:05:40.020> liked<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.500> as<00:05:40.560> well<00:05:40.590> so

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
in fact she really liked it as well so

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.380 
in fact she really liked it as well so
instead<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.580> getting<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.910> same<00:05:42.150> one<00:05:42.360> she

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
instead of getting the same one she

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.540 
instead of getting the same one she
decided<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.110> get<00:05:43.229> this<00:05:43.380> blue<00:05:43.680> one<00:05:43.950> here<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.460> we

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
decided to get this blue one here and we

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.400 
decided to get this blue one here and we
both<00:05:44.700> decided<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.419> would<00:05:45.840> probably<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.320> be

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
both decided that would probably just be

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.170 
both decided that would probably just be
better<00:05:46.620> people<00:05:46.890> share<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.520> two<00:05:47.669> of<00:05:47.820> them<00:05:48.000> so

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
better people share the two of them so
