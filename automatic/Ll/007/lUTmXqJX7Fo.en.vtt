but it's pulling data in from your
iPhone<00:01:20.230> well<00:01:20.920> if<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.130> had<00:01:21.280> native

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
iPhone well if you had native

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.270 
iPhone well if you had native
applications<00:01:22.600> on<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.960> Apple<00:01:23.260> watch<00:01:23.290> it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
applications on the Apple watch it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.920 
applications on the Apple watch it
things<00:01:24.610> would<00:01:24.790> just<00:01:24.970> be<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.150> lot<00:01:25.360> better<00:01:25.540> number

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
things would just be a lot better number

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.540 
things would just be a lot better number
one<00:01:26.080> that<00:01:26.200> would<00:01:26.260> be<00:01:26.320> speedier<00:01:26.860> because

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
one that would be speedier because

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.010 
one that would be speedier because
everything's<00:01:27.910> running<00:01:28.150> natively<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
everything's running natively on the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.790 
everything's running natively on the
device<00:01:29.260> itself

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
device itself

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.350 
device itself
number<00:01:30.250> two<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.520> could<00:01:30.640> do<00:01:30.790> things<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.210> you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
number two you could do things that you

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840 
number two you could do things that you
can't<00:01:31.600> do<00:01:31.810> right<00:01:32.020> now<00:01:32.200> such<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:32.680> run<00:01:33.130> overcast

and actually store music on overcast

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.500 
and actually store music on overcast
itself<00:01:38.040> another<00:01:39.040> thing<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.270> lose

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
itself another thing is that if you lose

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.540 
itself another thing is that if you lose
your<00:01:40.690> connection<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.350> your<00:01:41.470> iPhone<00:01:41.920> guess

when<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.070> launch<00:01:51.310> overcast<00:01:52.120> again<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.110> all

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
when I launch overcast again this is all

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.510 
when I launch overcast again this is all
you're<00:01:53.440> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.040> want<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.220> see<00:01:54.370> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
you're going to see you want to see the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.670 
you're going to see you want to see the
airplane<00:01:54.820> icon<00:01:55.150> with<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> name<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.530> app

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
airplane icon with the name of the app

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.260 
airplane icon with the name of the app
below

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
below

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270 
below
and<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.109> any<00:01:58.289> third-party<00:01:58.979> app<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and that's for any third-party app that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.499 
and that's for any third-party app that
I<00:01:59.340> open<00:01:59.609> up<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> same

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I open up you're going to see the same

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
I open up you're going to see the same
thing<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.320> relying<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
thing because it's relying on that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.910 
thing because it's relying on that
connection<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> iPhone<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.990> order<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.649> run

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
connection to the iPhone in order to run

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
connection to the iPhone in order to run
but<00:02:05.789> with<00:02:06.030> native<00:02:06.360> apps<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.750> wouldn't<00:02:06.990> have

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
but with native apps you wouldn't have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.279 
but with native apps you wouldn't have
that<00:02:07.289> problem<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.720> big

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that problem at all so that is one big

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
that problem at all so that is one big
thing<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.679> jailbreaking<00:02:11.459> could

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
thing that jailbreaking could

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.750 
thing that jailbreaking could
potentially<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:12.840> us<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.560> future<00:02:13.950> now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
potentially do for us in the future now

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.119 
potentially do for us in the future now
another<00:02:15.150> thing<00:02:15.269> that's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.989> big<00:02:16.410> deal<00:02:16.620> or<00:02:16.890> sort

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
another thing that's a big deal or sort

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.400 
another thing that's a big deal or sort
of<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.250> big<00:02:17.430> deal<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.910> timeout<00:02:18.690> feature<00:02:18.989> on

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
of a big deal is the timeout feature on

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.619 
of a big deal is the timeout feature on
the<00:02:19.590> Apple<00:02:19.890> watch<00:02:19.920> by<00:02:20.700> default<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.299> can't

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
the Apple watch by default you can't

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.020 
the Apple watch by default you can't
change<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.319> timeout<00:02:22.560> setting<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.610> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
change the timeout setting so if you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.059 
change the timeout setting so if you
just<00:02:24.269> wake<00:02:24.569> your<00:02:24.750> Apple<00:02:25.230> watch<00:02:25.260> by<00:02:25.680> raising

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
just wake your Apple watch by raising

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.309 
just wake your Apple watch by raising
your<00:02:26.340> wrist<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.330> six<00:02:27.660> seconds<00:02:28.140> before

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
your wrist you get six seconds before

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.229 
your wrist you get six seconds before
the<00:02:28.680> device<00:02:28.950> times<00:02:29.340> out<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.760> screen<00:02:30.000> times

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
the device times out the screen times

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.360 
the device times out the screen times
out<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.140> actually<00:02:31.500> press<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> button<00:02:32.069> I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
out and if you actually press a button I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.850 
out and if you actually press a button I
believe<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.000> 14<00:02:33.569> seconds<00:02:34.200> before<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
believe you get 14 seconds before the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.039 
believe you get 14 seconds before the
screen<00:02:35.130> times<00:02:35.519> out<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.150> there's<00:02:36.299> no<00:02:36.690> way<00:02:36.989> to

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
screen times out but there's no way to

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.800 
screen times out but there's no way to
change<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.799> whatsoever<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.480> Apple

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
change that whatsoever in the Apple

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.199 
change that whatsoever in the Apple
watch<00:02:39.930> settings<00:02:40.380> you're<00:02:40.530> basically<00:02:40.980> just

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
watch settings you're basically just

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.509 
watch settings you're basically just
stuck<00:02:42.209> with<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.870> default<00:02:43.230> timeout<00:02:43.890> windows

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
stuck with the default timeout windows

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.150 
stuck with the default timeout windows
and<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.480> may<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.720> because<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and it may be because you think the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.680 
and it may be because you think the
timeout<00:02:47.489> windows<00:02:47.790> are<00:02:47.940> too<00:02:48.060> long<00:02:48.269> but<00:02:48.540> maybe

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
timeout windows are too long but maybe

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.509 
timeout windows are too long but maybe
you<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> reduce<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.799> windows<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.280> save

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
you want to reduce the windows and save

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.250 
you want to reduce the windows and save
even<00:02:50.760> more<00:02:50.940> battery<00:02:51.480> life<00:02:51.510> or<00:02:51.870> maybe<00:02:52.079> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
even more battery life or maybe you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.559 
even more battery life or maybe you
think<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> time<00:02:52.819> or<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.970> windows<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.420> too

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
think the time or the windows are too

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.050 
think the time or the windows are too
short<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.019> that's<00:02:55.170> probably<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.310> general

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
short and that's probably the general

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.850 
short and that's probably the general
consensus<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> comes<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> Apple

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
consensus when it comes to the Apple

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860 
consensus when it comes to the Apple
watch<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.849> would<00:02:59.970> be<00:03:00.090> nice<00:03:00.329> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.750> could

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
watch but it would be nice if you could

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.809 
watch but it would be nice if you could
change<00:03:01.079> those<00:03:01.440> jailbreaking<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.549> course

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
change those jailbreaking of course

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.460 
change those jailbreaking of course
would<00:03:03.299> make<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> possibility

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
would make that a possibility

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.280 
would make that a possibility
now<00:03:05.370> watch<00:03:05.670> faces<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.359> nice<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.079> about

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
now watch faces are nice but what about

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.349 
now watch faces are nice but what about
full<00:03:07.650> fledged<00:03:07.920> custom<00:03:08.459> themes<00:03:08.730> yes<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.239> mean

has been a hot topic of debate ever

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.490 
has been a hot topic of debate ever
since<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:29.970> Apple<00:03:30.299> watch<00:03:30.420> was<00:03:30.720> announced<00:03:31.349> and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
since the Apple watch was announced and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.740 
since the Apple watch was announced and
Apple<00:03:32.280> included<00:03:32.760> something<00:03:33.180> called<00:03:33.450> power

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
Apple included something called power

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720 
Apple included something called power
reserve<00:03:34.290> mode<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.889> help<00:03:35.099> save<00:03:35.310> battery<00:03:35.340> life

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
reserve mode to help save battery life

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.879 
reserve mode to help save battery life
but<00:03:36.389> actually<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.810> find<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.170> battery<00:03:37.349> life<00:03:37.680> to

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
but actually I find the battery life to

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.259 
but actually I find the battery life to
be<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.340> good<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.760> Apple<00:03:39.000> watch<00:03:39.030> I

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
be really good on the Apple watch I

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.509 
be really good on the Apple watch I
never<00:03:39.510> need<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> use<00:03:39.930> power<00:03:40.319> reserve<00:03:40.709> mode<00:03:41.010> so

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
never need to use power reserve mode so

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.830 
never need to use power reserve mode so
with<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:42.000> mind<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.329> will<00:03:42.450> be<00:03:42.540> nice<00:03:42.810> if

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
with that in mind it will be nice if

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.559 
with that in mind it will be nice if
Apple<00:03:43.470> allowed<00:03:43.739> us<00:03:43.980> or<00:03:44.190> jailbreakers<00:03:45.000> allowed

watch haptic feedback and how that it's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.430 
watch haptic feedback and how that it's
a<00:04:46.220> bit<00:04:46.400> lacking<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.630> running<00:04:47.930> theme<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.320> that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
a bit lacking the running theme is that

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.870 
a bit lacking the running theme is that
at<00:04:48.560> times<00:04:48.770> it's<00:04:49.070> hard<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.340> feel<00:04:49.550> when<00:04:49.760> the
