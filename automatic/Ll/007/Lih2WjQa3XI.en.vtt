time<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> little<00:02:41.730> bit<00:02:41.910> of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
time I'm going to do a little bit of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
time I'm going to do a little bit of
point<00:02:42.390> cutting<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.530> point<00:02:43.830> cutting<00:02:44.070> does<00:02:44.370> is

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
point cutting what point cutting does is

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.000 
point cutting what point cutting does is
it<00:02:44.670> makes<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.120> line<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.780> harsh<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.710> just

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it makes the line not so harsh it just

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.550 
it makes the line not so harsh it just
sort<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> lets<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.940> hair<00:02:48.150> lay<00:02:48.390> softly<00:02:49.080> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
sort of lets the hair lay softly and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.270 
sort of lets the hair lay softly and
like<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.220> said<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.490> doing<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.790> an<00:02:50.910> angle<00:02:51.360> so

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
like I said I'm doing it an angle so

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.440 
like I said I'm doing it an angle so
basically<00:02:53.280> however<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:53.850> angling<00:02:54.150> your

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
basically however you're angling your

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.420 
basically however you're angling your
hands<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.900> how<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.140> hair<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.160> cut

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
hands is how the hair is going to be cut

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.970 
hands is how the hair is going to be cut
so<00:02:57.240> if<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.450> want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.750> cut<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.050> straight<00:02:58.290> across<00:02:58.500> I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so if I want to cut it straight across I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.770 
so if I want to cut it straight across I
would<00:02:59.190> hold<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.520> hand<00:02:59.760> straight<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.510> want

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
would hold my hand straight if you want

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.200 
would hold my hand straight if you want
it<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.990> be<00:03:01.080> longer<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.790> want<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.060> do

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
you keep the length at the top and you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.300 
you keep the length at the top and you
keep<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.350> little<00:03:13.380> bit<00:03:13.680> shorter<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.160> the

keep it a little bit shorter on the
sides<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.260> also<00:03:16.590> allowing<00:03:16.920> me

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
sides and what this is also allowing me

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.729 
sides and what this is also allowing me
to<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.640> allowing<00:03:18.060> me<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> blend<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
sides with the top here and here so that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000 
sides with the top here and here so that
you<00:03:24.540> don't<00:03:24.720> have<00:03:24.840> short<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.590> long<00:03:25.770> all
