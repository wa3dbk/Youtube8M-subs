so<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.069> Philomena<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.879> she<00:00:06.359> was<00:00:06.480> brought

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
so this is Philomena and she was brought

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.110 
so this is Philomena and she was brought
in<00:00:06.810> by<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:06.990> SPCA<00:00:07.589> as<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> pregnant<00:00:08.519> stray<00:00:08.880> cat

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
in by the SPCA as a pregnant stray cat

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.549 
in by the SPCA as a pregnant stray cat
now<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.840> course<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.200> don't<00:00:10.230> really

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
now of course we don't really

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.140 
now of course we don't really
necessarily<00:00:10.769> know<00:00:11.340> when<00:00:11.639> she's<00:00:12.000> gonna

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
necessarily know when she's gonna

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.450 
necessarily know when she's gonna
deliver<00:00:12.450> her<00:00:12.750> kittens<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.980> don't<00:00:14.130> know<00:00:14.280> when

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
deliver her kittens we don't know when

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.129 
deliver her kittens we don't know when
she<00:00:14.670> became<00:00:14.940> pregnant<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.719> don't<00:00:15.870> even<00:00:16.020> know

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
she became pregnant we don't even know

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.340 
she became pregnant we don't even know
how<00:00:16.289> old<00:00:16.320> she<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.699> she's<00:00:18.180> probably<00:00:18.750> based

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
how old she is so she's probably based

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.460 
how old she is so she's probably based
on<00:00:19.590> her<00:00:19.890> physical<00:00:20.340> exam<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.090> her<00:00:21.150> teeth<00:00:21.470> we're

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
on her physical exam and her teeth we're

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
on her physical exam and her teeth we're
guessing<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> she's<00:00:23.369> probably<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:24.180> much

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
guessing that she's probably not much

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.019 
guessing that she's probably not much
older<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.350> year<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.369> year<00:00:26.580> old<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
older than a year if a year old and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
older than a year if a year old and
she's<00:00:27.240> pretty<00:00:27.449> small<00:00:27.840> overall<00:00:28.500> except<00:00:28.980> for

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
she's pretty small overall except for

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.479 
she's pretty small overall except for
her<00:00:29.220> pregnant<00:00:29.670> belly<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.150> fairly<00:00:31.080> big

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
her pregnant belly which is fairly big

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
her pregnant belly which is fairly big
we<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.669> know<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.120> pregnancy<00:00:33.719> lasts

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
we do know that a pregnancy lasts

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.200 
we do know that a pregnancy lasts
approximately<00:00:34.430> sixty-five<00:00:35.430> days<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.000> cat

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
approximately sixty-five days in a cat

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.950 
approximately sixty-five days in a cat
but<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.840> vary<00:00:37.140> anywhere<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:38.120> 62<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> 71

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
but it can vary anywhere from 62 to 71

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.799 
but it can vary anywhere from 62 to 71
days<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.370> range<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.420> few<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
days it can range from as few as one

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
days it can range from as few as one
kitten<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.190> many<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.579> six<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:44.969> seven<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
kitten to as many as six or seven we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.069 
kitten to as many as six or seven we
rarely<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:46.050> more<00:00:46.260> than<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.870> use

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
rarely see more than that so we will use

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
rarely see more than that so we will use
our<00:00:49.260> x-ray<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.219> try<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> determine<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.149> many

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
our x-ray to try and determine how many

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
our x-ray to try and determine how many
kittens<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.469> born<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
kittens are going to be born and that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
kittens are going to be born and that
helps<00:00:53.940> us<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> cats<00:00:55.140> delivering

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
helps us also when the cats delivering

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
helps us also when the cats delivering
her<00:00:55.949> kittens<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.059> they're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
her kittens to know when they're

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
her kittens to know when they're
finished<00:00:57.840> delivering<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.309> for

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
finished delivering so that we know for

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
finished delivering so that we know for
certain<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.300> they're<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.289> holding<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
certain that they're not holding a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.470 
certain that they're not holding a
kitten<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> maybe<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
kitten in there that maybe there's a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
kitten in there that maybe there's a
problem<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.110> delivery<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> look<00:01:06.450> at

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
problem with delivery so if you look at

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
problem with delivery so if you look at
this<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> picture<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> her<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.830> her

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this this is a picture of her on her

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.820 
this this is a picture of her on her
side<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.909> her<00:01:09.180> spine<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.960> inside

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
side so we can see her spine and inside

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.980 
side so we can see her spine and inside
of<00:01:11.010> her<00:01:11.130> belly<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.360> number<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
of her belly we can see a number of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.560 
of her belly we can see a number of
heads<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:14.100> spines<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
heads and little spines so these are the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.380 
heads and little spines so these are the
kittens<00:01:15.960> inside<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.790> we're<00:01:17.939> trying<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
kittens inside and what we're trying to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
kittens inside and what we're trying to
do<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.310> actually

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
do there is see because we can actually

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580 
do there is see because we can actually
tell<00:01:21.060> where<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> bones<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
tell where the bones are that they have

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.670 
tell where the bones are that they have
calcium<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.729> they're<00:01:23.880> dark<00:01:24.270> white

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
calcium in them and they're dark white

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
calcium in them and they're dark white
we<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.920> tell<00:01:26.220> she's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> certain<00:01:27.240> number<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we can tell she's a certain number of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.109 
we can tell she's a certain number of
days<00:01:27.990> along<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.700> fairly

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
days along because we know fairly

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
days along because we know fairly
consistently<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> kittens<00:01:31.200> develop<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
consistently the kittens develop the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920 
consistently the kittens develop the
calcium<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.820> their<00:01:32.939> bones<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> different

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
calcium in their bones in the different

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
calcium in their bones in the different
types<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> bones<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.770> certain<00:01:35.100> days<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
types of bones at certain days and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
types of bones at certain days and
development<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.540> guess<00:01:36.780> again<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
development so we can guess again that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740 
development so we can guess again that
she's<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:37.979> gonna<00:01:38.280> deliver<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.479> next

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
she's probably gonna deliver in the next

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
she's probably gonna deliver in the next
few<00:01:39.930> days<00:01:40.079> based<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> kittens

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
few days based on the way the kittens

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
few days based on the way the kittens
looked<00:01:41.939> when<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.689> took<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> x-ray<00:01:43.380> last<00:01:43.560> week

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
looked when we took the x-ray last week

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.069 
looked when we took the x-ray last week
we're<00:01:44.159> counting<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.750> three<00:01:46.710> four<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
we're counting one two three four and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
we're counting one two three four and
possibly<00:01:49.079> five<00:01:49.350> kittens<00:01:49.890> inside<00:01:50.369> Philomena

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
possibly five kittens inside Philomena

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
possibly five kittens inside Philomena
but<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.630> won't<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:52.020> until<00:01:52.200> she<00:01:52.380> delivers<00:01:52.619> her

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but we won't know until she delivers her

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.179 
but we won't know until she delivers her
kittens<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.610> humming<00:01:53.820> air<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> there

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
kittens really humming air in there

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
kittens really humming air in there
we've<00:01:56.189> provided<00:01:56.670> her<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.420> nesting<00:01:58.020> box

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
we've provided her with a nesting box

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
we've provided her with a nesting box
and<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.189> quiet<00:01:59.460> place<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.030> sleep<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> she<00:02:01.439> will

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and a quiet place to sleep so she will

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
and a quiet place to sleep so she will
probably<00:02:02.969> deliver<00:02:03.329> her<00:02:03.509> kittens<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.110> night

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
probably deliver her kittens at night

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
probably deliver her kittens at night
because<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> veterinary<00:02:06.180> clinic<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
because this is a veterinary clinic and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
because this is a veterinary clinic and
it<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.229> fairly<00:02:07.710> busy<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.399> cats<00:02:09.090> tend<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it is fairly busy here cats tend not to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
it is fairly busy here cats tend not to
deliver<00:02:10.679> when<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> commotion

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
deliver when there's a lot of commotion

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.800 
deliver when there's a lot of commotion
around

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
around

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.780 
around
so<00:02:13.380> most<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.040> time<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.610> have

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so most of the time when we have

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.280 
so most of the time when we have
pregnant<00:02:15.209> cats<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:15.900> will<00:02:16.110> deliver

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
pregnant cats here they will deliver

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.400 
pregnant cats here they will deliver
when<00:02:16.680> no<00:02:17.100> one's<00:02:17.280> around
