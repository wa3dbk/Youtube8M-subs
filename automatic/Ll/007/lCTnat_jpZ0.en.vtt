and before angry becomes zero I want the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.450 
and before angry becomes zero I want the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
speed to be slow again so we add a new

equal to and angry equal to one now when
this<00:03:59.500> happens<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.310> set<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.390> speed<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:03.720> monster

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
this happens we set the speed of monster

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
this happens we set the speed of monster
and<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.830> is<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> bullet<00:04:06.340> tab<00:04:06.700> set<00:04:07.450> speed<00:04:08.340> and

and that is a bullet tab set speed and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:18.319 
and that is a bullet tab set speed and
we<00:04:09.490> set<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.940> 50
