through going through not much to say so
I'm<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.610> let<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.320> video<00:00:40.320> speak<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I'm just gonna let the video speak for

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.330 
I'm just gonna let the video speak for
itself

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.800 

it's<00:00:43.820> probably<00:00:44.000> hard<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.450> hear<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:46.330> bombs<00:00:47.330> and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's probably hard to hear the bombs and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.500 
it's probably hard to hear the bombs and
sound<00:00:48.140> from<00:00:48.500> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
sound from the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.220 
sound from the
TV<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.489> best<00:00:52.670> i<00:00:52.789> can<00:00:52.969> do<00:00:53.149> since<00:00:54.019> I

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
TV but it is the best i can do since I

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.329 
TV but it is the best i can do since I
don't<00:00:54.440> really<00:00:54.649> know<00:00:54.859> how<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.070> record<00:00:55.550> from<00:00:55.910> the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
don't really know how to record from the

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.459 
don't really know how to record from the
TV<00:00:58.339> itself<00:00:58.809> why<00:00:59.809> am<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.019> having<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:00.320> much

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
TV itself why am I having so much
