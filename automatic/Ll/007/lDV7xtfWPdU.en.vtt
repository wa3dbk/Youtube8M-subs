00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I'm not exactly sure but as you see this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.699 
I'm not exactly sure but as you see this
character<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.820> has<00:03:15.750> gone<00:03:16.410> through<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.229 

well<00:03:20.590> actually<00:03:20.920> done<00:03:21.459> recruiting<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:22.030> blaze

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
like hurt like what she did I think that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.320 
like hurt like what she did I think that
one's<00:03:25.480> for<00:03:26.640> something<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.819> don't<00:03:28.000> know<00:03:28.120> maybe

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
one's for something I don't know maybe

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.350 
one's for something I don't know maybe
tongue<00:03:29.170> guard<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:33.000> here's<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> current

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
tongue guard and here's the current

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.059 
tongue guard and here's the current
character<00:03:34.750> time<00:03:34.959> playing<00:03:35.379> through<00:03:35.500> has<00:03:38.069> but

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
character time playing through has but

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.860 
character time playing through has but
this<00:03:39.519> one<00:03:39.760> yeah

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
this one yeah

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:53.820 
this one yeah
it's<00:03:41.319> kind<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.989> bugged<00:03:43.989> out<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:53.590> it's

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
it's kind of bugged out I think it's

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.330 
it's kind of bugged out I think it's
probably<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.190> shrine<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.519> heroes<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:56.340> just

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
probably the shrine of heroes and just

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.030 
probably the shrine of heroes and just
make<00:03:57.610> that<00:03:57.790> one<00:03:57.849> empty<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.440> see<00:04:02.769> now<00:04:02.890> it's

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
make that one empty and see now it's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.030 
make that one empty and see now it's
empty<00:04:03.430> which<00:04:03.760> means<00:04:03.790> they<00:04:04.299> probably<00:04:05.040> be

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
empty which means they probably be

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.819 
empty which means they probably be
something<00:04:06.250> else<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.819> can<00:04:07.269> also<00:04:07.620> track<00:04:08.620> this

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
something else you can also track this

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.309 
something else you can also track this
character<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.150> it'll<00:04:10.660> probably<00:04:10.840> update<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.290> so

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
character so it'll probably update it so

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.940 
character so it'll probably update it so
let's<00:04:11.769> do<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.420> voice<00:04:13.420> type<00:04:13.780> default<00:04:14.319> hangout

do<00:04:19.540> enemy<00:04:20.200> as<00:04:20.350> player<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:22.060> can<00:04:22.210> also<00:04:22.360> do<00:04:22.919> can

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
do enemy as player you can also do can

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.110 
do enemy as player you can also do can

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
character or I can try to fix it so that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.960 
character or I can try to fix it so that
the<00:04:38.759> other<00:04:38.879> character<00:04:39.270> goes<00:04:39.509> back<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:40.970> I'll
