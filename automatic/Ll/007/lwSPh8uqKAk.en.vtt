you know just playing gig clips and I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.240 
you know just playing gig clips and I
don't<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.160> that<00:01:22.660> it's<00:01:23.660> fucking<00:01:24.140> boring<00:01:24.890> and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
don't like that it's fucking boring and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.670 
don't like that it's fucking boring and
the<00:01:25.610> game<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.970> just<00:01:26.120> not<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.390> fun<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.530> that's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the game is just not that fun so that's

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.620 
the game is just not that fun so that's
why<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.550> can<00:01:28.910> get<00:01:29.030> mono<00:01:29.180> for<00:01:29.480> two

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
why I I can get mono for two

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.280 
why I I can get mono for two
free-for-alls

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
free-for-alls

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.190 
free-for-alls
faster<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.370> easier<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:32.210> better<00:01:32.960> quality

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
faster and easier and better quality

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.840 
faster and easier and better quality
than<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.620> would<00:01:33.860> if<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.040> got<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.220> model<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:34.670> three

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
than I would if I got a model for three

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.430 
than I would if I got a model for three
control<00:01:35.980> just<00:01:36.980> for<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.250> fact<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:38.030> a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
control just for the fact that it's a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.960 
control just for the fact that it's a
fun<00:01:39.440> or<00:01:39.560> game<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.920> play<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.460> appeals<00:01:40.760> more

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
fun or game to play and it appeals more

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.200 
fun or game to play and it appeals more
to<00:01:41.030> me<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.300> my<00:01:41.450> play<00:01:41.659> style<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:42.970> feel<00:01:43.970> like<00:01:44.120> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
to me and my play style I feel like I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.690 
to me and my play style I feel like I
have<00:01:44.330> more<00:01:44.510> wiggle<00:01:44.750> room<00:01:44.870> if<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.010> want<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.610> say

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
have more wiggle room if you want to say

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.430 
have more wiggle room if you want to say
it<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.060> guess<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.570> feel<00:01:48.140> like<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.320> have

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
it like that I guess I feel like I have

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.260 
it like that I guess I feel like I have
more<00:01:48.590> room<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.830> do<00:01:49.130> stuff<00:01:49.460> it<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:49.909> feels<00:01:50.120> like

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
more room to do stuff it just feels like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.030 
more room to do stuff it just feels like
it's<00:01:50.450> more<00:01:51.070> flexible<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:53.030> modern<00:01:53.390> warfare<00:01:53.510> 3

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
it's more flexible that modern warfare 3
