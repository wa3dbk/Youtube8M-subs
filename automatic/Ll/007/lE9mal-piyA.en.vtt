13.6 2 billion years ago this is in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.720 
13.6 2 billion years ago this is in

contrast with the runescape MMORPG which
is<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> little<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.540> nine<00:00:42.570> years<00:00:42.750> old<00:00:43.290> the

is a little over nine years old the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
is a little over nine years old the
difference<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> therefore<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.809> real

low detail and no detail real life

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.720 
low detail and no detail real life
however<00:02:56.840> has<00:02:57.380> much<00:02:57.710> better<00:02:57.980> graphics<00:02:58.460> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
however has much better graphics and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
however has much better graphics and
these<00:02:59.060> are<00:02:59.210> widely<00:02:59.570> regarded<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.140> be

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
these are widely regarded to be

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.640 
these are widely regarded to be
virtually<00:03:00.800> indistinguishable<00:03:01.310> from<00:03:01.850> reality

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
virtually indistinguishable from reality

thus<00:03:03.650> real<00:03:04.190> life<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> clear<00:03:05.060> winner<00:03:05.330> on

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
thus real life is a clear winner on
