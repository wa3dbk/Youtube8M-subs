accomplishment for me and it tapped me

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140 
accomplishment for me and it tapped me
out<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.169> time<00:03:01.409> now<00:03:02.069> i've<00:03:02.549> been<00:03:02.819> playing

probably<00:03:07.739> half<00:03:08.639> an<00:03:08.790> hour<00:03:08.939> to<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.419> if<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.629> was

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
probably half an hour to see if it was

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.659 
probably half an hour to see if it was
still<00:03:09.870> possible<00:03:10.199> in<00:03:10.739> icecrown<00:03:10.919> because

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
still possible in icecrown because

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.459 
still possible in icecrown because
somebody<00:03:12.060> told<00:03:12.239> me<00:03:12.389> that<00:03:12.510> they<00:03:12.810> nerfed<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.290> but

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
they didn't erf it they just actually

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.949 
they didn't erf it they just actually
you<00:03:16.379> know<00:03:16.500> how<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:16.949> change<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> AoE<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.480> can

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you know how they change the AoE I can

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.589 
you know how they change the AoE I can
still<00:03:19.199> pull<00:03:19.530> three<00:03:20.250> packs<00:03:20.519> at<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.879> time<00:03:21.120> solo

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
it's just I don't know maybe the drops

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.429
