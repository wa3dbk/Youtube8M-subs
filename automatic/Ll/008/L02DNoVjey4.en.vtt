00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060 
could play a major part in this but I'm
not<00:01:59.090> sure<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.659> entirely<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.740> reason

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
not sure that's entirely the reason

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.760 
not sure that's entirely the reason
because<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:02.210> hear<00:02:02.540> women<00:02:02.810> use<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.140> name<00:02:03.290> Loki

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
because a I hear women use the name Loki

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.890 
because a I hear women use the name Loki
more<00:02:03.979> than<00:02:04.130> they<00:02:04.220> could<00:02:04.280> Tom<00:02:04.700> B<00:02:05.360> while<00:02:05.780> he's

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
more than they could Tom B while he's

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.899 
more than they could Tom B while he's
not<00:02:06.079> bad-looking<00:02:06.470> per<00:02:07.009> se<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.430> don't<00:02:07.700> think

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
not bad-looking per se I don't think

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.429 
not bad-looking per se I don't think
he's<00:02:08.030> good-looking<00:02:08.329> enough<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.929> win<00:02:09.110> women

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
he's good-looking enough to win women

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.100 
he's good-looking enough to win women
over<00:02:09.649> just<00:02:09.860> based<00:02:10.099> on<00:02:10.250> his<00:02:10.399> looks<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.000> see<00:02:11.599> he

about<00:02:19.530> Avengers<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.310> particular<00:02:20.760> seem<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.510> get

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
about Avengers in particular seem to get

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.020 
about Avengers in particular seem to get
the<00:02:21.780> low-key<00:02:22.110> train<00:02:22.410> steaming<00:02:22.950> first<00:02:23.820> off

the low-key train steaming first off

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.550 
the low-key train steaming first off
maybe<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.750> size<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> audience

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
maybe just the size of the audience

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.890 
maybe just the size of the audience
could<00:02:25.980> play<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> big<00:02:26.400> part<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:27.150> again<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.750> have

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.330 
could play a big part but again you have
so<00:02:28.050> many<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.290> these<00:02:28.410> heroes<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.860> choose<00:02:29.100> from

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so many of these heroes to choose from

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
so many of these heroes to choose from
why<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.880> suddenly<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.420> sex<00:02:30.660> object

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
why is he suddenly the sex object

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.440 
why is he suddenly the sex object
well<00:02:31.620> maybe<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.460> Avengers<00:02:32.940> he<00:02:33.300> had

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
well maybe because it Avengers he had

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.330 
well maybe because it Avengers he had
another<00:02:33.810> quality<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:34.500> often<00:02:34.890> considered

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
and I guess is in the end this will be

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.770 
and I guess is in the end this will be
the<00:06:27.470> lucky<00:06:27.800> lady<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.340> do<00:06:28.520> it<00:06:28.669> wait<00:06:29.509> that's<00:06:29.690> a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
the lucky lady to do it wait that's a

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.430 
the lucky lady to do it wait that's a
dude<00:06:29.990> there<00:06:30.949> Brahmas<00:06:31.780> but<00:06:32.780> again<00:06:33.110> there

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
dude there Brahmas but again there

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.860 
dude there Brahmas but again there
doesn't<00:06:33.800> seem<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:34.039> be<00:06:34.250> one<00:06:34.490> particular

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
doesn't seem to be one particular

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.360 
doesn't seem to be one particular
element<00:06:35.870> that<00:06:35.960> everyone<00:06:36.440> can<00:06:36.620> agree<00:06:36.740> on<00:06:36.979> is

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
element that everyone can agree on is

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.040 
element that everyone can agree on is
the<00:06:37.550> one<00:06:37.820> element<00:06:38.509> that<00:06:38.539> makes<00:06:38.840> him

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
the one element that makes him

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.960 
the one element that makes him
attractive<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:40.099> that's<00:06:40.400> when<00:06:40.550> it<00:06:40.669> hit<00:06:40.789> me

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
attractive and that's when it hit me

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.939 
attractive and that's when it hit me
maybe<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.570> isn't<00:06:41.780> one<00:06:42.349> of<00:06:42.530> these<00:06:42.680> elements

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
maybe it isn't one of these elements

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.020 
maybe it isn't one of these elements
maybe<00:06:43.669> it's<00:06:44.030> all<00:06:44.360> of<00:06:44.419> these<00:06:44.990> elements<00:06:46.030> loki

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
maybe it's all of these elements loki

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.909 
maybe it's all of these elements loki
seems<00:06:47.270> to<00:06:47.449> be<00:06:47.570> the<00:06:47.720> perfect<00:06:48.169> combination<00:06:48.500> of

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
seems to be the perfect combination of

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.149 
seems to be the perfect combination of
dominant<00:06:49.460> and<00:06:49.580> submissive<00:06:49.789> weak<00:06:50.599> and<00:06:50.900> strong

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
dominant and submissive weak and strong

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.589 
dominant and submissive weak and strong
intimidating<00:06:52.159> and<00:06:52.310> pathetic<00:06:52.849> and<00:06:53.060> because

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
intimidating and pathetic and because

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.390 
intimidating and pathetic and because
they<00:06:53.750> picked<00:06:53.990> an<00:06:54.110> actor<00:06:54.470> who<00:06:54.590> can<00:06:54.620> balance<00:06:55.010> all

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
they picked an actor who can balance all

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.279 
they picked an actor who can balance all
those<00:06:55.550> elements<00:06:56.120> so<00:06:56.360> well<00:06:56.750> while<00:06:57.050> also

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
those elements so well while also

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.379 
those elements so well while also
maintaining<00:06:57.620> a<00:06:58.039> good<00:06:58.250> dose<00:06:58.460> of<00:06:58.639> humor<00:06:59.000> I<00:06:59.180> guess

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
maintaining a good dose of humor I guess

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.779 
maintaining a good dose of humor I guess
there<00:07:00.110> is<00:07:00.289> something<00:07:00.770> that<00:07:00.800> can<00:07:01.099> probably<00:07:01.639> be

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789 
there is something that can probably be

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:03.580 
there is something that can probably be
considered<00:07:01.970> attractive<00:07:02.810> about<00:07:02.930> him<00:07:03.260> it's

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
considered attractive about him it's

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.219 
considered attractive about him it's
strange<00:07:03.979> even<00:07:04.490> downright<00:07:05.090> bizarre<00:07:05.300> but<00:07:05.990> I

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
strange even downright bizarre but I

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.930 
strange even downright bizarre but I
guess<00:07:06.680> it's<00:07:06.860> better<00:07:07.039> to<00:07:07.220> have<00:07:07.340> a<00:07:07.400> character

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
guess it's better to have a character

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.520 
guess it's better to have a character
that<00:07:07.970> can<00:07:08.270> be<00:07:08.389> appreciated<00:07:08.630> for<00:07:09.080> his<00:07:09.199> many

that can be appreciated for his many

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.499 
that can be appreciated for his many

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
it's in what way he fails and how much

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.850 
it's in what way he fails and how much
control<00:07:22.970> or<00:07:23.419> lack<00:07:23.659> of<00:07:23.840> control<00:07:24.199> he<00:07:24.380> has<00:07:24.560> when
