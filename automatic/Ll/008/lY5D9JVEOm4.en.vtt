00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
first band o that I showed and then the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.989 
first band o that I showed and then the
bottoms<00:02:11.159> are<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.549> quarterly<00:02:14.549> orange

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
like this rouging kind of thing going on

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
like this rouging kind of thing going on
here<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.560> these<00:02:22.800> because<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.370> have

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here and I like these because they have

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.530 
here and I like these because they have
a<00:02:24.300> thicker<00:02:24.660> side<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.150> revealing

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
a thicker side so it's not so revealing

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.900 
a thicker side so it's not so revealing
I<00:02:27.930> guess<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.740> haven't<00:02:29.070> noticed<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.640> really

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
I guess if you haven't noticed I really

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.750 
I guess if you haven't noticed I really
like<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.330> whole<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.660> Coralie<00:02:31.260> pinky<00:02:31.860> kind

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
like the whole like Coralie pinky kind

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300 
like the whole like Coralie pinky kind
of<00:02:32.910> color<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> next<00:02:34.110> few<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:34.800> kind<00:02:35.160> of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
of color so the next few are all kind of

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.310 
of color so the next few are all kind of
separates<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.360> they<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
separates so they don't really have a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.340 
separates so they don't really have a
matching<00:02:37.680> top<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.430> bottom<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
matching top and bottom I just have a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.550 
matching top and bottom I just have a
plain<00:02:40.680> old<00:02:41.040> black<00:02:41.580> bottom<00:02:42.270> from<00:02:43.050> Victoria's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
plain old black bottom from Victoria's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.550 
plain old black bottom from Victoria's
Secret<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:44.070> well<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.300> basic

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
Secret as well it's just your basic

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.340 
Secret as well it's just your basic
string<00:02:46.560> tie<00:02:47.010> bikini<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.810> always<00:02:49.110> really

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
string tie bikini and it's always really

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500 
string tie bikini and it's always really
a<00:02:49.440> good<00:02:49.740> idea<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.430> basic<00:02:50.880> black<00:02:51.060> bottoms

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
a good idea to get basic black bottoms

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.140 
a good idea to get basic black bottoms
because<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> buy<00:02:52.830> top<00:02:53.280> separate<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
because you can buy top separate and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.270 
because you can buy top separate and
then<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.510> match<00:02:54.690> them<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:54.990> these<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
then you can match them with these so I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.300 
then you can match them with these so I
like<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> match<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.210> first<00:02:57.450> bando<00:02:57.870> top<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
like to match the first bando top the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.980 
like to match the first bando top the
one<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> anchor<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.660> black

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
one with the anchor with the black

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.980 
one with the anchor with the black
bottoms<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.710> then<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> also<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.990> like

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
bottoms and then I also have this like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.490 
bottoms and then I also have this like
zebra<00:03:04.440> printed<00:03:05.040> top<00:03:05.490> which<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:06.930> really

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
zebra printed top which I don't really

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.740
