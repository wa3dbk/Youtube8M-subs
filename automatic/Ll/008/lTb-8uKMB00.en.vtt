all-purpose<00:01:43.259> lens<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
all-purpose lens it's what I like to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840 
all-purpose lens it's what I like to
call<00:01:45.390> wide<00:01:46.049> normal<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:47.520> within

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
call wide normal so it's still within

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.010 
call wide normal so it's still within
the<00:01:48.119> range<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.570> normal

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the range of normal

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
the range of normal
it<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.590> distort<00:01:49.860> too<00:01:50.070> much<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.790> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it doesn't distort too much but it's on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.880 
it doesn't distort too much but it's on
the<00:01:50.939> wide<00:01:51.180> end<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:52.470> normal<00:01:52.770> would

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the wide end of that your normal would

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.480 
the wide end of that your normal would
be<00:01:53.009> around<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.460> 43<00:01:53.939> 45<00:01:54.680> some<00:01:55.680> people<00:01:55.920> say<00:01:56.040> 50s

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
be around like 43 45 some people say 50s

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.359 
be around like 43 45 some people say 50s
your<00:01:56.610> normal<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.100> more

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
your normal one but you know it's more

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.539 
your normal one but you know it's more
around<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.880> 43<00:02:00.630> 3<00:02:01.290> mark<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.680> 50s<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.310> little

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
around that 43 3 mark so 50s a little

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
around that 43 3 mark so 50s a little
bit<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.820> than<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.079> lower

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
bit more than that and if you go lower

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080 
bit more than that and if you go lower
than<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.670> sort<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> like

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
than that then you get like sort of like

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.300 
than that then you get like sort of like
a<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.420> 35<00:02:06.899> millimeter<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.770> why<00:02:08.250> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
a here 35 millimeter so that's why I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
a here 35 millimeter so that's why I
call<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> wide<00:02:09.000> normal<00:02:09.420> lens<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.869> it's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
call this a wide normal lens and it's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.410 
call this a wide normal lens and it's
really<00:02:10.890> great<00:02:11.160> I've<00:02:11.580> been<00:02:11.940> using<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.330> for

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
really great I've been using this for

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.640 
really great I've been using this for
I<00:02:14.140> would<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.220> want<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> say<00:02:15.730> two<00:02:15.790> months<00:02:16.240> now<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I would I want to say two months now and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.900 
I would I want to say two months now and
this<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:17.800> first<00:02:18.069> 30<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.670> thirty

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
this my first 30 you know thirty

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.610 
this my first 30 you know thirty
five-millimeter<00:02:19.120> prime<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.989> it's<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
five-millimeter prime and it's it's a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.309 
five-millimeter prime and it's it's a
very<00:02:21.370> nice<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.510> nice<00:02:22.720> land<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.200> you

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
very nice it's a very nice land so you

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.170 
very nice it's a very nice land so you
can<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.709> close<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> someone<00:02:24.340> or<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:25.030> can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
can get close to someone or you can

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940 
can get close to someone or you can
still<00:02:25.450> shoot<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.840> know<00:02:25.959> your<00:02:26.110> wide<00:02:26.319> shots<00:02:26.620> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
still shoot you know your wide shots and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.760 
still shoot you know your wide shots and
get<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> lot<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> shot<00:02:28.330> with<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> 35

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
get a lot in the shot with a 35

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.699 
get a lot in the shot with a 35
millimeter<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.209> this<00:02:31.480> my<00:02:31.810> favorite<00:02:32.140> focal

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
millimeter now is this my favorite focal

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.809 
millimeter now is this my favorite focal
length<00:02:32.860> for<00:02:32.920> street<00:02:33.280> photography<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.700> know

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
length for street photography I know

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.620 
length for street photography I know
it's<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.120> lot<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.420> people's<00:02:36.180> favorite<00:02:37.180> focal

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
it's a lot of people's favorite focal

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's a lot of people's favorite focal
length<00:02:37.750> especially<00:02:38.319> because<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.190> just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
length especially because they can just

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.420 
length especially because they can just
slap<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> 35<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.600> they<00:02:40.720> don't<00:02:40.900> need<00:02:41.050> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
slap on a 35 and they don't need to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.100 
slap on a 35 and they don't need to
think<00:02:42.430> about<00:02:42.640> changing<00:02:42.970> lenses<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.959> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
think about changing lenses and in that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
think about changing lenses and in that
regard<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.590> very<00:02:44.800> good<00:02:45.010> lens<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.519> if<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.790> were

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
regard it's very good lens but if I were

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.020 
regard it's very good lens but if I were
to<00:02:46.000> choose<00:02:46.300> two<00:02:46.989> lenses<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.850> would<00:02:48.850> actually

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
to choose two lenses I would actually

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.539 
to choose two lenses I would actually
rather<00:02:49.330> shoot<00:02:49.630> with<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> 50<00:02:50.380> millimeter<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.430> a

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
rather shoot with a 50 millimeter and a

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.930 
rather shoot with a 50 millimeter and a
28<00:02:51.940> millimeter<00:02:52.120> or<00:02:52.690> maybe<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.410> 24<00:02:53.860> 21<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.610> that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
28 millimeter or maybe a 24 21 on that

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300 
28 millimeter or maybe a 24 21 on that
wide<00:02:55.269> end<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.799> 50<00:02:57.130> millimeter

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
wide end I really like the 50 millimeter

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.809 
wide end I really like the 50 millimeter
it's<00:02:58.239> not<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.690> wide<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.260> when<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.250> look<00:03:00.459> at<00:03:00.580> a

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
it's not that wide so when you look at a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.970 
it's not that wide so when you look at a
lot<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.209> contemporary<00:03:02.049> street<00:03:02.470> photography

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
lot of contemporary street photography

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.949 
lot of contemporary street photography
you<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.250> see<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> lot<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.730> wide<00:03:04.090> shots<00:03:04.450> that

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
you you see a lot of wide shots that

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.979 
you you see a lot of wide shots that
gets<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.350> lot<00:03:05.620> into<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.069> frame<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.989> although

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
gets a lot into the frame and although

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.449 
gets a lot into the frame and although
you<00:03:08.049> know<00:03:08.290> those<00:03:08.470> kinds<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.890> shots<00:03:09.040> are<00:03:09.220> nice<00:03:09.340> I

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
you know those kinds of shots are nice I

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.460 
you know those kinds of shots are nice I
do<00:03:09.549> like<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.209> fifty<00:03:10.510> moon<00:03:10.840> your<00:03:11.080> focal<00:03:11.350> length

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
do like the fifty moon your focal length

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.039 
do like the fifty moon your focal length
I<00:03:11.590> think<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:11.920> shows<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.760> enough<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.870> course

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
I think it shows just enough of course

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.690 
I think it shows just enough of course
it<00:03:14.319> depends<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.739> when<00:03:14.890> you're<00:03:15.010> taking<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:15.519> it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
it depends on when you're taking but it

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.180 
it depends on when you're taking but it
shows<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.000> enough<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:17.319> still<00:03:17.680> isolate

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
shows just enough you can still isolate

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.699 
shows just enough you can still isolate
that<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.579> your<00:03:19.480> subject<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.530> still

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
that in your subject but you can still

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.770 
that in your subject but you can still
get<00:03:20.859> its<00:03:21.010> surroundings<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.730> give<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
get its surroundings to give you a

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.960 
get its surroundings to give you a
context<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.680> what's<00:03:24.100> happening<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.760> scene

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
around with the 35 millimeter but from

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.910 
around with the 35 millimeter but from
what<00:04:02.530> I've<00:04:02.709> experienced<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.489> far<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:04.920> think

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
what I've experienced so far I think

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.789 
what I've experienced so far I think
yeah<00:04:06.370> something<00:04:06.940> wider<00:04:07.180> than<00:04:07.450> 28<00:04:08.140> would<00:04:08.380> would

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
yeah something wider than 28 would would

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.500 
yeah something wider than 28 would would
would<00:04:09.160> be<00:04:09.190> my<00:04:09.459> preferred<00:04:09.819> focal<00:04:10.180> length<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:10.420> if

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
would be my preferred focal length so if

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.090 
would be my preferred focal length so if
I<00:04:10.600> were<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.870> choose<00:04:11.049> two<00:04:11.319> lenses<00:04:11.650> as<00:04:11.859> like<00:04:12.069> a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
I were to choose two lenses as like a

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.759 
I were to choose two lenses as like a
combo<00:04:12.579> then<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.359> definitely<00:04:13.750> choose<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> 28

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
combo then I definitely choose like a 28

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.099 
combo then I definitely choose like a 28
of<00:04:15.670> 28<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.500> 50<00:04:17.889> millimeter<00:04:18.250> lens<00:04:18.310> as

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
of 28 and a and a 50 millimeter lens as

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
of 28 and a and a 50 millimeter lens as
my<00:04:20.109> go-to<00:04:20.470> lenses<00:04:20.859> if<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.070> were<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> choose<00:04:21.760> one

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
my go-to lenses if I were to choose one

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.690 
my go-to lenses if I were to choose one
lens<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.450> think<00:04:22.780> 35<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.860> really<00:04:24.099> nice<00:04:24.250> maybe<00:04:24.610> a

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
lens I think 35 is really nice maybe a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.879 
lens I think 35 is really nice maybe a
28<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.330> 35<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.140> really<00:04:26.349> nice<00:04:26.500> for

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
28 but 35 is really nice for

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.219 
28 but 35 is really nice for
for<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.610> one<00:04:27.789> lens<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.270> that's<00:04:28.659> my<00:04:28.810> opinion

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
for just one lens so that's my opinion

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.529 
for just one lens so that's my opinion
on<00:04:29.409> you<00:04:29.740> know<00:04:29.889> what<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.310> best<00:04:30.909> lens<00:04:31.210> Russia
