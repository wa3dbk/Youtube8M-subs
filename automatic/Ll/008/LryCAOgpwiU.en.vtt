00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
have been kind of really close to our

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.810 
have been kind of really close to our
deaths<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.199> this<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.530> know<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:53.890> came<00:00:54.790> back

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
deaths in this you know and came back

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.579 
deaths in this you know and came back
and<00:00:55.540> will<00:00:55.809> pretty<00:00:55.960> much<00:00:56.049> back<00:00:56.260> where<00:00:56.500> we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
and will pretty much back where we

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.170 
and will pretty much back where we
started<00:00:56.650> and<00:00:57.070> now<00:00:57.309> blinds<00:00:57.640> are<00:00:57.820> fifty<00:00:58.089> hundred

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
started and now blinds are fifty hundred

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.670 
started and now blinds are fifty hundred
so<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:58.629> hundred<00:00:58.870> big<00:00:58.960> ones<00:00:58.989> tax<00:00:59.379> which<00:00:59.589> I'm

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680
