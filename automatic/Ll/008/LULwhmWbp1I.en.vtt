around<00:02:51.620> thirty<00:02:53.120> three<00:02:54.120> star<00:02:54.420> candies<00:02:54.840> out<00:02:55.739> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
around thirty three star candies out of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640 
around thirty three star candies out of
one<00:02:56.100> syringe<00:02:56.690> by<00:02:57.690> pulling<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.410> kind<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
one syringe by pulling on it kind of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.500 
one syringe by pulling on it kind of
works<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.430> works<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> material<00:03:00.269> into

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
works the works the material into

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
works the works the material into
the<00:03:00.600> fibers<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.769> also<00:03:01.950> lets<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.459> see<00:03:02.820> where

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the fibers it also lets you see where

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.900 
the fibers it also lets you see where
you're<00:03:03.269> where<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.660> need<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.610> add<00:03:05.610> more

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
you're where you need to add more

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.770 
you're where you need to add more
material<00:03:06.830> which<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.600> great

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
material which is right here the great

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.170 
material which is right here the great
thing<00:03:10.049> about<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.470> stuff<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.180> even

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
thing about this stuff is that even

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.539 
thing about this stuff is that even
after<00:03:12.480> its<00:03:12.630> cured<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.100> add<00:03:14.280> more

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
after its cured you can add more

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.500 
after its cured you can add more
material<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.100> nice<00:03:17.250> benefit<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.180> forms

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
material it's a nice benefit it forms

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.509 
material it's a nice benefit it forms
one<00:03:18.720> unit<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.739> lot<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.980> people<00:03:20.220> complain

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
one unit and a lot of people complain

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.789 
one unit and a lot of people complain
about<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.760> tacky<00:03:21.060> feel<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:22.200> tacky<00:03:22.470> feel

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
about the tacky feel that tacky feel

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.520 
about the tacky feel that tacky feel
actually<00:03:23.269> acts<00:03:24.269> as<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> bonding<00:03:24.989> agent<00:03:25.170> which

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
actually acts as a bonding agent which

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.170 
actually acts as a bonding agent which
allows<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> build<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.459> material<00:03:26.970> back

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
allows you to build more material back

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.000 
allows you to build more material back
past<00:03:29.060> well<00:03:30.060> I'll<00:03:30.120> show<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.360> just<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.660> moment

what I'm talking about let me cure that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.039 
what I'm talking about let me cure that
it's<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.820> flexible<00:03:36.360> stuff<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.720> taking<00:03:36.989> a

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
it's this flexible stuff is taking a

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.259 
it's this flexible stuff is taking a
little<00:03:37.110> bit<00:03:37.260> longer<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.519> cure<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:38.910> taking

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
little bit longer to to cure it's taking

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.770 
little bit longer to to cure it's taking
about<00:03:40.400> 10<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.640> 15<00:03:42.000> seconds<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.660> we're

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
about 10 to 15 seconds is what we're

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020 
about 10 to 15 seconds is what we're
telling<00:03:42.959> people<00:03:43.350> compare<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
telling people compare that to the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.390 
telling people compare that to the
standard<00:03:45.959> stuff<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.230> we're<00:03:46.470> using<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.890> thin

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
standard stuff that we're using the thin

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.890 
standard stuff that we're using the thin
and<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.060> thick<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:49.530> usually<00:03:50.070> takes<00:03:50.310> only

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
and the thick that usually takes only

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.390 
and the thick that usually takes only
three<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.019> five<00:03:52.200> seconds<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> cure<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> entire

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
three to five seconds to cure the entire

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.910 
three to five seconds to cure the entire
fly<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.870> real<00:03:55.110> simple<00:03:55.470> mature<00:03:55.769> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
fly and it's just real simple mature to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.720 
fly and it's just real simple mature to
use<00:03:56.040> there's<00:03:56.220> no<00:03:56.430> way<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.780> really<00:03:57.780> screw<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.260> up

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
use there's no way to really screw it up

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.300 
use there's no way to really screw it up
it's<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.790> as<00:04:00.060> real<00:04:00.299> foolproof<00:04:01.190> all<00:04:02.190> right

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
it's just as real foolproof all right

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.750 
it's just as real foolproof all right
I'm<00:04:02.430> gonna<00:04:02.549> light<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.790> up<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.760> change

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
I'm gonna light it up and we can change

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.100 
I'm gonna light it up and we can change
the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.660 

we'll<00:04:09.110> add<00:04:09.319> at<00:04:09.620> materials<00:04:10.190> because<00:04:10.430> we're<00:04:10.580> not

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
we'll add at materials because we're not

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.790 
we'll add at materials because we're not
perfectly<00:04:11.239> symmetrical<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.500> what<00:04:12.650> we're

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
perfectly symmetrical and what we're

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.930 
perfectly symmetrical and what we're
doing<00:04:13.010> right<00:04:13.129> now<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.459> basically

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
doing right now is just basically

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.720 
doing right now is just basically
building<00:04:14.330> up<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.540> body<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.400> mentioned

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
building up a body like I mentioned

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.340 
building up a body like I mentioned
earlier<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.209> thinner<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:18.019> apply<00:04:18.290> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
earlier the thinner you you apply the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.250 
earlier the thinner you you apply the
material<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:20.889> more<00:04:21.889> flexibility<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.700> has

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
material the more flexibility it has

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.350 
material the more flexibility it has
that's<00:04:24.260> that's<00:04:24.620> cured<00:04:25.040> but<00:04:25.880> what<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.060> want<00:04:26.300> to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
that's that's cured but what I want to

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.980 
that's that's cured but what I want to
do<00:04:26.540> is<00:04:26.780> add<00:04:27.770> some<00:04:27.800> more<00:04:28.460> material<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.810> make<00:04:29.930> it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
do is add some more material to make it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.159 
do is add some more material to make it
look<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.380> little<00:04:30.560> bit<00:04:30.800> more<00:04:30.950> symmetrical<00:04:32.169> so

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
look a little bit more symmetrical so

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.600 
look a little bit more symmetrical so
I'm<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.590> going<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.800> squeeze<00:04:33.979> on<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> little

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
I'm just going to squeeze on a little

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.409 
I'm just going to squeeze on a little
bit<00:04:34.700> more<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:36.979> get<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.970> bit<00:04:38.090> more<00:04:38.270> more

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
bit more and get a little bit more more

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.840 
bit more and get a little bit more more
rounded<00:04:39.050> here<00:04:41.440> we<00:04:42.440> just<00:04:42.560> do<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.889> by<00:04:43.100> again

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
rounded here we just do that by again

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.510 
rounded here we just do that by again
squeezing<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.300> applicator<00:04:45.370> pushing<00:04:46.370> down

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
squeezing the applicator pushing down

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.740 
squeezing the applicator pushing down
the<00:04:46.669> plunger<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:51.350> we're<00:04:51.500> good<00:04:52.540> now<00:04:53.540> we're

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
the plunger and we're good now we're

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.790 
the plunger and we're good now we're
much<00:04:53.990> more<00:04:54.290> symmetrical<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.530> fuller

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
much more symmetrical I have a fuller

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.500 
much more symmetrical I have a fuller
body<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.830> you're<00:05:00.979> able<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.280> push<00:05:01.639> the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
body and you're able to push the

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.110 
body and you're able to push the
material<00:05:03.250> exactly<00:05:04.250> where<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.610> need<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.910> be

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
material exactly where you need it to be

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.469 
material exactly where you need it to be
there<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.210> is

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
there it is

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.680 
there it is
so<00:05:09.470> we<00:05:09.560> light<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.740> up<00:05:09.889> again<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:11.240> tackiness

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
so we light it up again that tackiness
