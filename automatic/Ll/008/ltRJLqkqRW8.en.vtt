00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 here you are finally a new firmware 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.030
 don't even know well and badly 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.559
 6 39 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.949
 by the way yesterday 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.970
 came downgrade for 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.310
 6 38 therefore I do not know where the basis 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.089
 st 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.089
 it is no less but nonetheless 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 firmware six of them 9 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.079
 if you study for it as a lawyer you cannot 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.620
 come back 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 use burns will be impossible 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.499
 but 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:41.739
 everything remains the same that is you can 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.670
 yet again 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.490
 play 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.500
 signed r 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.780
 but that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.770
 we are the only one that he can yet 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 to make 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.350
 as the newspaper found out 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.580
 and you know what you can do 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 tell the law way this signature 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.050
 Basil 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.530
 nothing but lived did not bring only supposedly 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 effort why most likely he 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 they are all the same that they thought and closed 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 but thinks a lot 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760
 Antic 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.990
 why with a knife
