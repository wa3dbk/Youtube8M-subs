00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of them or actually a lot of them do not

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
of them or actually a lot of them do not
have<00:00:17.970> screenshots<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.930> i<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.109> no<00:00:19.470> idea<00:00:19.770> how

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
have screenshots so i have no idea how

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.320 
have screenshots so i have no idea how
the<00:00:19.920> map<00:00:20.160> looks<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> map<00:00:20.970> could<00:00:21.119> look

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the map looks like so the map could look

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.040 
the map looks like so the map could look
like<00:00:21.359> complete<00:00:21.600> shit<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
like complete shit and I don't know it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.470 
like complete shit and I don't know it
I'm<00:00:25.050> pretty<00:00:25.380> sure<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.400> they

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
I'm pretty sure it in that what are they

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.260 
I'm pretty sure it in that what are they
shooting<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.830> wool<00:00:29.060> ok<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:32.270> round

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
shooting at wool ok so this is a round

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
shooting at wool ok so this is a round
platform<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> middle<00:00:37.700> no

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
platform we have this in the middle no

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.750 
platform we have this in the middle no
spawn<00:00:39.030> point<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.920> really<00:00:40.920> wonder<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
spawn point I really wonder and I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.420 
spawn point I really wonder and I
there's<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> map<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.559> played<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
there's got to be a map that I played so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.470 
there's got to be a map that I played so
many<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.059> MOBA<00:00:46.579> style<00:00:47.579> maps<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
many of these like MOBA style maps but

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
many of these like MOBA style maps but
of<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> ones<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.039> i<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> remember<00:00:50.489> no<00:00:50.879> one

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of the ones that i can remember no one

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.670 
of the ones that i can remember no one
has<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> Swampert<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> middle<00:00:52.260> why<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
has a Swampert in the middle why is that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.639 
has a Swampert in the middle why is that
that<00:00:53.550> could<00:00:53.760> give<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> strategic<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.500> know

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that could give the strategic you know

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
that could give the strategic you know
spike<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> needs<00:00:57.469> because<00:00:59.809> well<00:01:00.809> good

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
spike that it needs because well good

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.509 
spike that it needs because well good
thing<00:01:01.170> about<00:01:01.289> also<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.280> strategy<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:04.519> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
thing about also about strategy is that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.700 
thing about also about strategy is that
oh<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.880> edge<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.600> certain<00:01:10.530> way

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
oh you can get an edge on a certain way

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
oh you can get an edge on a certain way
i<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.850> give<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.060> example<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
i will give an example you will get a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
i will give an example you will get a
certain<00:01:15.330> edge<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:16.290> having<00:01:16.619> skill<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.130> having

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
certain edge by having skill by having

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
certain edge by having skill by having
experience<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> game<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
experience in the game but it's not

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
experience in the game but it's not
necessarily<00:01:19.409> strategy<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.640> odds<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
necessarily strategy if the odds are the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.950 
necessarily strategy if the odds are the
same<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.710> balance<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
same the balance is right and that is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.620 
same the balance is right and that is
very<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
very good in you can have you know a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.609 
very good in you can have you know a
very<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:27.840> play<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:30.619> there's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
very nice play through but there's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
very nice play through but there's
chance<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.640> might<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.710> strategy

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
chance that there might not be strategy

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.200 
chance that there might not be strategy
if<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.430> exactly<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.150> mirror<00:01:36.479> image<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.990> itself

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
if it's exactly a mirror image of itself

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
if it's exactly a mirror image of itself
you<00:01:39.210> could<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> course<00:01:39.630> create<00:01:40.380> strategy<00:01:40.890> even

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you could of course create strategy even

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.590 
you could of course create strategy even
in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> balanced<00:01:41.790> gameplay<00:01:42.119> by<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.479> example

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
in a balanced gameplay by for example

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.399 
in a balanced gameplay by for example
adding<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.850> their<00:01:45.299> side<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.810> spot<00:01:46.110> for

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
adding you know on their side a spot for

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
adding you know on their side a spot for
snipers<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.220> side<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> spot<00:01:47.790> for

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
snipers on the other side of spot for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.630 
snipers on the other side of spot for
snipers<00:01:48.590> spots<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> could<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
snipers spots that you could take to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600 
snipers spots that you could take to
maybe<00:01:50.880> cover<00:01:51.210> each<00:01:51.780> other<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> case

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
maybe cover each other but in this case

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.280 
maybe cover each other but in this case
where<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:54.780> much<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.079> level

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
where it's pretty much one level

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.540 
where it's pretty much one level
it<00:01:58.290> becomes<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:58.830> much<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> skill-based

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
it becomes pretty much a skill-based

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.620 
it becomes pretty much a skill-based
thing<00:02:04.070> whereas<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.940> spawn<00:02:06.420> point

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
thing whereas if you have a spawn point

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
thing whereas if you have a spawn point
in<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.750> middle<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.560> could<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.070> we're

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
in the middle you could say well we're

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.170 
in the middle you could say well we're
going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> group<00:02:08.880> we're<00:02:09.030> going

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
going to go with the group we're going

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.230 
going to go with the group we're going
to<00:02:09.240> take<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> middle<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.990> we're<00:02:10.140> gonna<00:02:11.030> try<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
to take a middle and we're gonna try and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.410 
to take a middle and we're gonna try and
kill<00:02:12.390> everything<00:02:12.620> from<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.160> know<00:02:14.190> from<00:02:14.520> over

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
kill everything from you know from over

tension<00:05:48.050> there<00:05:50.050> but<00:05:51.050> that's<00:05:51.110> because<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.409> was

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
tension there but that's because I was
