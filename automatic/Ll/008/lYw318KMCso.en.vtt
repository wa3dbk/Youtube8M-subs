00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 get out today to create this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 multifunctional jewelry holder between 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 quotation given time that you can there 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 put a lot have your bracelets 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 rings etc 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:29.310
 and so these parties I hope that you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.349
 please we start with the little 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.120
 cup that will be able to contain all 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 the rings and all that is impossible 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 to hang differently so as you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.520
 see I'm just going to mix 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 several colors of fimo paste so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 it's like the jewelry cup that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 I had done in my video rooms pirate 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 chain if you if you remember 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 so once I spread this ball 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 of patch become the glue and around a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 glass just for it to take 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 the form and then I came to intersect the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.949
 bounds 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 be it my places and we will 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.960
 cook for half an hour at 110 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.960
 degrees 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.830
 very important do not forget to come 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 to make a hole with the nail before 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.410
 to cook for power after hanging and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 finally to cooking you do not stay 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.060
 than to unmute it in quotation marks 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.260
 detach it from the glass and file the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.280
 edges so that I have not finished but 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.440
 do not forget to do it 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.090
 allow to equalize everything and especially 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.090
 to have a well-being rendering 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.759
 then let the cup cool 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.140
 they went to the rest of the frame so 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.789
 to start you will take some 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.920
 skewers and surround them with 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.659
 miskin you can also paint them 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.950
 personally I preferred to do with 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.899
 to call me because I found that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.250
 more beautiful so here you actually 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.110
 as much as you want and if I did 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.659
 three because I knew in master all 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:00.189
 just 3 / no frames then we will come 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.560
 limit the size of the peak to 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.420
 skewer and cut off the excess like that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.069
 it will fit perfectly in the frame 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 and as it's done you can stick 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.649
 so simply with glue 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.360
 strong 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.160
 I decided to add a piece of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
 petty t to be sure that it fits 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.590
 at a good time with strong glue 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.660
 it should be fine 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 so of course you do that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.010
 two sides and with the three spades to 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.730
 skewers or with the number you 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.730
 have decided to 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.730
 then we will come and place the nails 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.560
 so I decided to put away 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.439
 is first I made a point to be 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.079
 sure it's in the right place and then 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.640
 I used a pliers to drive the 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.209
 nail is not primarily that's enough 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 dangerous 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.079
 and then it does not work so that's it 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.819
 I had to remake omar just after 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.819
 but still very very careful 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.519
 then you just have to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 hang the fat cup lies 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:14.389
 we did before cooking and your 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.739
 jewelry door will be finished so that's it 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.060
 this video is over I hope 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.319
 that she will have us more do not forget to 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.120

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.099

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.540
