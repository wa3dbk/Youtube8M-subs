basically tells you it's eight gigabyte

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically tells you it's eight gigabyte
and<00:00:34.910> tells<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.270> comes<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> HDMI

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
I guess there's another adapter for

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.639 
I guess there's another adapter for
charging<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.920> tablet<00:00:50.370> controller<00:00:51.059> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
in the Nintendo Wii T maybe a little bit

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.920 
in the Nintendo Wii T maybe a little bit
longer<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.560> got<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.950> fan<00:02:20.220> right<00:02:20.459> here

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
longer and you got the fan right here

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.839 
longer and you got the fan right here
make<00:02:21.930> sure<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.200> clean<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.620> fan<00:02:23.130> every

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
make sure you clean out that fan every

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.449 
make sure you clean out that fan every
once<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.810> year<00:02:25.079> or<00:02:25.200> maybe<00:02:25.349> every<00:02:25.920> few<00:02:26.130> months<00:02:26.190> if

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
once a year or maybe every few months if

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.770 
once a year or maybe every few months if
you<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> cat<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.420> probably<00:02:27.660> ought<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you have a cat and probably ought to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
you have a cat and probably ought to
clean<00:02:27.959> out<00:02:28.109> every<00:02:28.349> frickin<00:02:28.709> month<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.970> as

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
clean out every frickin month but as

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.289 
clean out every frickin month but as
long<00:02:30.359> as<00:02:30.389> these<00:02:30.630> venture<00:02:31.590> clean<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
long as these venture clean you know the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.030 
long as these venture clean you know the
cool<00:02:33.480> air<00:02:33.660> comes<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.230> ha

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
cool air comes in ha

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.849 
cool air comes in ha
you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.250> blows<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.450> hot<00:02:36.599> air<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
you know blows out the hot air so just

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.860 
you know blows out the hot air so just
keeps<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> running<00:02:38.400> good<00:02:38.669> it<00:02:39.540> looks<00:02:39.720> like

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
keeps it running good it looks like

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.080 
keeps it running good it looks like
right<00:02:40.049> here<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.680> lithium<00:02:41.250> battery<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
right here is the lithium battery I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.059 
right here is the lithium battery I
believe<00:02:42.419> just<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.380> had<00:02:44.269> open<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.419> up

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
believe just like the we had open it up

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.280 
believe just like the we had open it up
SD<00:02:47.069> card<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.209> maybe<00:02:48.389> you<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.750> expand<00:02:49.169> your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
SD card so maybe you can expand your

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.360 
SD card so maybe you can expand your
memory<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:50.780> set<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.900> eight<00:02:52.109> gigabytes<00:02:52.590> like

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
memory to set up eight gigabytes like

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.009 
memory to set up eight gigabytes like
this<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.700> has<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.359> because<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
this one has this because this is the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.259 
this one has this because this is the
basic<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.620> got<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.419> 300<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.769> maybe<00:02:59.130> make<00:02:59.430> you

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
basic I got for 300 you maybe make you

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.629 
basic I got for 300 you maybe make you
know<00:03:00.359> increase<00:03:01.079> your<00:03:01.230> storage<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.799> maybe<00:03:02.010> 40

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
know increase your storage to maybe 40

I<00:04:30.240> guess<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.660> brings<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.110> straight<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
I guess this brings you straight to the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.820 
I guess this brings you straight to the
home<00:04:31.880> microphone<00:04:32.880> right<00:04:33.180> here<00:04:33.740> looks<00:04:34.740> like

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
home microphone right here looks like

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.589 
home microphone right here looks like
there's<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.130> speaker<00:04:35.520> there<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.210> another

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
there's a speaker there and another

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.779 
there's a speaker there and another
speaker<00:04:36.960> there<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.560> stereo<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.610> kind

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
speaker there so it's stereo it's kind

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.719 
speaker there so it's stereo it's kind
of<00:04:38.820> cool<00:04:39.380> TV<00:04:40.380> controller<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:41.099> I<00:04:41.130> guess<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.669> is

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
of cool TV controller so I guess this is

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.339 
of cool TV controller so I guess this is
a<00:04:41.789> universal<00:04:42.389> remote<00:04:42.510> that's<00:04:42.990> freaking

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
a universal remote that's freaking

awesome battery

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.839 
awesome battery
I<00:04:45.690> guess<00:04:45.960> if<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.260> blinks<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.159> tells<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.639> to

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
I guess if that blinks it tells you to

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.300 
I guess if that blinks it tells you to
charge<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.889> select<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.250> start<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:51.479> know
