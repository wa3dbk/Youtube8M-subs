00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello everyone, welcome you to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.109
 channel game auditor with you pathos know 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.000
 For me, the whole series of broken sword games is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.400
 just a benchmark quest in the first two 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 parts of the series were both good humor and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.420
 good puzzles and good 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 the plot I went through all four and a half 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 parts of this game and if anyone knows something 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.590
 officially kinsmart barrack game series 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.750
 has 4 parts but also exists 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.680
 amateur modification wearing number 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.359
 2.5 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 this version was weak but she 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.830
 gained widespread and her 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 can not be ignored, and here is some time 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.120
 back games broken sword 5 places or on 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.129
 kickstarter game quickly gained the desired 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 amount and and began to develop what I 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.850
 overwhelmingly happy but just a couple of days 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 ago the game officially came out and play 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.309
 She can anyone anyone though about 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.719
 Iâ€™m probably excited for everyone 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.430
 There is no Russian version of the game at the moment. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 and I did not hear that someone was taken and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.390
 publish with us therefore if you are bad 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.129
 familiar with indian then you have to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.230
 wait for at least the fan 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 or better yet the official translation, I also 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 I speak English well therefore 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 enjoyed this masterpiece from the first minutes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.760
 its release and those probably first necessary 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.369
 generally prioritize and gram 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 so we can rate the fifth in 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.060
 within what parts 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 the best part is the first part 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.080
 it was just amazing on the second 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 the place for me is the second third part personally 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
 4 was a failure for me 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 tried to correct the situation and therefore 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.930
 I think it is better 3 but worse than the first such 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 the fifth part is on this list and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 becomes the place 4 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.079
 but let's take it from the first minute 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.240
 games it becomes clear that the developers 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 back to basics and one fifth of all 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 forces trying to imitate the first two 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 for example the strings of the game reminded me 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.700
 it is the first part that we even meet 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 old acquaintances and thank god 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.730
 the hero is still the same good old 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.800
 george mig 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.660
 and of course the main feature 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.050
 that the fifth part aspires to the originals 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.670
 this is the most direct classical system 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 point-n-click by the way about the strings in general 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.900
 tell about the plot of the quest and not about 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.210
 burn it will be very difficult therefore 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.130
 I will tell only the very beginning that you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.200
 You see at the first run of the game and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.690
 will see in the next george stopper 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520
 the protagonist of the game does not all series work 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.650
 insurance company and is in the gallery 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.900
 at an exhibition of paintings where his company 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.730
 is the insurer course you articles in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
 gallery breaks down guy motorcycle 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.390
 a helmet with a gun where he steals one 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 the only picture as well kills 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.320
 the gallery owner so much for this exhibition 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 responsible george then he will 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.770
 find a picture so that its gas did not give 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
 insurance payments 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.970
 the separation process makes it clear that 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.020
 stolen a special picture which 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.210
 earned status 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.280
 devilish mystical besides and 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.230
 it is also clear that this particular picture 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.060
 planned to steal the very beginning and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 someone helped organize a robbery 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.410
 turn off the alarm here is so simple 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.970
 At first glance, the strings but a series of broken 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.950
 sword is very famous for 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.640
 their strings were very simple though 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.959
 and strange 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.209
 drenched it in the most incredible 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.340
 adventures again by the Templars and others 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.050
 orders of the Illuminati graphics too 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 has changed since 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.580
 the last part of all was a chur 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 cartoony and with light elements sat 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.480
 shading but again this is 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.530
 looks like trying to zakosa under the schedule 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 first two parts 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.300
 something like the first would look like 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.890
 parts if she came out nowadays 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.570
 although this moment studio revolution 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.850
 showed back in recently reissued and to 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.040
 the first and second parts of the wearer added 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.380
 director skat but again in this game 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.330
 graphics despite all its not its 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.340
 brightness juiciness and elaboration 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.190
 always goes to second on a ground plan 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.880
 worth a good script funny jokes 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.770
 charismatic characters 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.380
 mystical artifacts and the most 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.690
 a variety of puzzles know everything 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.030
 constantly assert that the quest genre 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.340
 dies that he became of little interest 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.320
 but the guys from revolution showed them 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.570
 don't care what analysts think they are 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.459
 did not change their role put the game 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.590
 on kickstarter kickstarter showed that 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.270
 instead of still interesting to people in the end 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.489
 thanks to all who supported the game on 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.600
 kickstarter and studio revolution which 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.280
 implemented the game 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.830
 we got a beautiful sample again 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.350
 quests showing that quests can 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.390
 be interesting and in demand i'm not 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.250
 I know how successful the game is financially 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 plan and too early to talk about it she 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.290
 Only recently came out but I bought the game and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.910
 very pleased with the purchase if you have everything in 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 okay with english then i recommend 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.570
 to think about acquiring broken 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.760
 sword 5 at least to support 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.320
 brave act guys for revolution yes 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.510
 and get a nice and interesting quest 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.890
 but if you have problems with English then 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.470
 don't rush wait at least 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.390
 fan translation is still a quest and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.190
 understand what is happening is necessary in 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.140
 otherwise you risk losing everything. 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.510
 the pleasure of the game and the pleasure of 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.180
 the games are really huge on this all 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.180
