when<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.810> studying<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.650> things<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
when I was studying I like things to be

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.560 
when I was studying I like things to be
a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.460> bit<00:01:41.610> interesting<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.329> what

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a little bit interesting you know what

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.789 
a little bit interesting you know what
I'm<00:01:42.659> looking<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.320> studying<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
I'm looking at it when I'm studying I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'm looking at it when I'm studying I
like<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> colors<00:01:44.460> pop<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.420> if

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
like when the colors pop out i would if

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
like when the colors pop out i would if
a<00:01:46.049> teacher<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.530> explaining<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.159> definition<00:01:47.670> i

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
a teacher was explaining a definition i

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
a teacher was explaining a definition i
would<00:01:47.970> write<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> word<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> different

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
would write the word in a different

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
would write the word in a different
color<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:49.649> define<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.549> black

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
color and then define it in like black

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
color and then define it in like black
or<00:01:50.939> blue<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.500> helps<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
or blue so that it just really helps you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
or blue so that it just really helps you
focus<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.640> important<00:01:54.119> things<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> your

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
were about and then i would just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.750 
were about and then i would just
continue<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> same<00:02:11.009> thing<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.459> really

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
continue to do the same thing not really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.340 
continue to do the same thing not really
relying<00:02:12.510> too<00:02:12.780> heavily<00:02:12.810> on

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
relying too heavily on

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.630 
relying too heavily on
I notes<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:14.070> looking<00:02:14.340> into<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
I notes but really looking into the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.810 
I notes but really looking into the
textbook<00:02:14.970> now<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.960> have<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.380> consider<00:02:17.040> if

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
textbook now you do have to consider if

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.150 
textbook now you do have to consider if
your<00:02:18.030> teacher<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> textbook<00:02:19.950> kind

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
your teacher is you know a textbook kind

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.950 
your teacher is you know a textbook kind
of<00:02:20.280> person<00:02:20.580> or<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.090> rely<00:02:21.420> more<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
of person or if they rely more on the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.780 
of person or if they rely more on the
notes<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.070> me<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> lot<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.490> my<00:02:23.550> classes

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
notes but for me a lot of my classes

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.340 
notes but for me a lot of my classes
were<00:02:24.060> textbook<00:02:24.540> heavy<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.990> that's<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.320> did

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
were textbook heavy so that's what I did

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
were textbook heavy so that's what I did
and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.190> ended<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.490> using<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:27.060> notes<00:02:27.390> as

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and then I ended up using my notes as

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.990 
and then I ended up using my notes as
kind<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.320> refresher<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:29.130> me<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.700> like

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
kind of like a refresher for me and like

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.530 
kind of like a refresher for me and like
a<00:02:30.060> almost<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.260> quiz<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.040> after<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> looked

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
a almost like a quiz so after I looked

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
a almost like a quiz so after I looked
through<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> textbook<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.440> all<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.920> topics

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
through the textbook at all the topics

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.160 
through the textbook at all the topics
then<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> would<00:02:36.240> go<00:02:36.270> through<00:02:36.600> my<00:02:36.750> notes<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
then I would go through my notes at the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.290 
then I would go through my notes at the
end<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.180> know<00:02:39.270> really

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
end and just see if I you know really

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.810 
end and just see if I you know really
got<00:02:39.840> everything<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.680> everything<00:02:40.950> made

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
got everything and if everything made

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.310 
got everything and if everything made
sense<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.270> me<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:42.870> understood

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
sense to me and I really understood

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.660 
sense to me and I really understood
everything<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.160> helped<00:02:44.490> me<00:02:44.640> out

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
everything so that really helped me out

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
everything so that really helped me out
because<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.840> know<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> was<00:02:46.470> reading<00:02:46.800> and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
because I you know I was reading and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.170 
because I you know I was reading and
retaining<00:02:47.190> information<00:02:47.460> but<00:02:47.880> at<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> same

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
retaining information but at the same

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.690 
retaining information but at the same
time<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.660> reviewing<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> end<00:02:49.830> another

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
time I was reviewing at the end another

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.430 
time I was reviewing at the end another
little<00:02:51.000> thing<00:02:51.030> which<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> people<00:02:52.050> might

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
little thing which a lot of people might

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.560 
little thing which a lot of people might
disagree<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.670> me<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.150> I'm<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> type<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
disagree with me on but I'm the type of

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.630 
disagree with me on but I'm the type of
person<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.990> just<00:02:55.260> says<00:02:55.710> skip<00:02:56.040> flashcards

person that just says skip flashcards

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.730 
person that just says skip flashcards
all<00:02:56.790> together<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.360> know<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.020> they<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.380> help

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.440 
all together I know that they do help
you<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.250> by<00:02:59.460> writing<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> down<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.270> are

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.960 
for me I honestly think they're a little
bit<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.710> waste<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> time<00:03:05.070> all<00:03:05.610> they<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.790> is

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
bit of a waste of time all they do is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.700 
bit of a waste of time all they do is
save<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:06.930> bit<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> space<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.620> you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
save you a little bit of space so you

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.200 
save you a little bit of space so you
don't<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.340> don't<00:03:08.520> have<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> carry<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.000> book

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
don't so you don't have to carry a book

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.250 
don't so you don't have to carry a book
around<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.870> have<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.020> carry<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
around you just have to carry the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.140 
around you just have to carry the
flashcards<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.550> say<00:03:11.670> skip<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.090> all

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
flashcards so I just say skip them all

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.270 
flashcards so I just say skip them all
together<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:13.110> focus<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.650> looking<00:03:13.980> at

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
together and just focus on looking at

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.680 
together and just focus on looking at
your<00:03:14.430> notes<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.880> trying<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.390> retain<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
your notes and trying to retain the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
your notes and trying to retain the
information<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.560> or<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.340> vocab

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
information that way or if it's a vocab

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.010 
information that way or if it's a vocab
book<00:03:17.910> or<00:03:18.030> something<00:03:18.240> I<00:03:18.390> would<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.690> cover<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
book or something I would just cover the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.480 
book or something I would just cover the
definition<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.710> look<00:03:19.830> at<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> word<00:03:20.220> and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
definition and just look at the word and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.130 
definition and just look at the word and
you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.240> it's<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> same<00:03:21.690> thing<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.960> flash

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
you know it's the same thing as a flash

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.750 
you know it's the same thing as a flash
card<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.770> end<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.310> saving<00:03:23.520> time

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
card so you just end up saving time

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.820 
card so you just end up saving time
another<00:03:24.540> thing<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.840> keep<00:03:24.960> in<00:03:25.080> mind<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.470> when

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
another thing to keep in mind is when

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.260 
another thing to keep in mind is when
you<00:03:25.980> are<00:03:26.100> studying<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.640> have<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.940> constantly

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270

you'll end up although you are putting a

the<00:04:40.170> stress<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.560> having<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.830> cram<00:04:41.070> before<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the stress of having to cram before the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.730 
the stress of having to cram before the
night<00:04:42.180> before<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.510> test<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:42.900> i<00:04:43.140> think<00:04:43.440> it's

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
night before the test so i think it's

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.320 
night before the test so i think it's
worth<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.790> way<00:04:44.970> you're<00:04:45.150> actually

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
worth it and that way you're actually

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.690 
worth it and that way you're actually
learning<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.650> information<00:04:46.770> instead<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.520> just

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
learning the information instead of just

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.490 
learning the information instead of just
memorizing<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.660> spitting<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.200> on<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
memorizing it and spitting it out on the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.380 
memorizing it and spitting it out on the
test<00:04:49.710> another<00:04:50.220> thing<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.520> think<00:04:50.640> about<00:04:50.910> if<00:04:51.210> you

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
test another thing to think about if you

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.120 
test another thing to think about if you
are<00:04:51.630> very<00:04:51.900> serious<00:04:52.320> about<00:04:52.380> your<00:04:52.650> studies<00:04:52.830> is

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
to form study groups for certain classes

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.280
