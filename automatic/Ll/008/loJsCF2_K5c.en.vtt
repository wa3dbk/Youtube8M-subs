00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
like that so let's get started

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
like that so let's get started
the<00:00:47.399> first<00:00:47.640> step<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> remove

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the first step is to just remove

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
the first step is to just remove
anything<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:51.000> doll's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
anything that you have in your doll's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
anything that you have in your doll's
hair<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.550> set<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> aside<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
hair so just set that aside and this is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.240 
hair so just set that aside and this is
what<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> doll<00:00:57.120> hair<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.780> before

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
what the doll hair looks like before

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
what the doll hair looks like before
I've<00:00:59.359> redone<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> brushed<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I've redone it and brushed it out and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.000 
I've redone it and brushed it out and
stuff<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.510> place<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.110> towel<00:01:04.350> behind

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
stuff so then I place the towel behind

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210 
stuff so then I place the towel behind
her<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:06.170> spray<00:01:07.170> her<00:01:07.439> clothes<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.189> her

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
her so I don't spray her clothes or her

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.600 
her so I don't spray her clothes or her
body<00:01:08.490> cloth<00:01:08.909> while<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> am<00:01:09.659> spraying<00:01:09.990> her<00:01:10.200> hair

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
body cloth while I am spraying her hair

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.920 
body cloth while I am spraying her hair
so<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:12.060> care<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> her<00:01:12.450> hair<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.840> pretty

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so to take care of her hair it's pretty

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
so to take care of her hair it's pretty
easy<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.010> time-consuming

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
easy it's just really time-consuming

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.010 
easy it's just really time-consuming
since<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.630> every<00:01:15.990> little

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
since you have to do every little

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740 
since you have to do every little
ringlets<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.890> itself<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
ringlets by itself but what I really

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950 
ringlets by itself but what I really
like<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.070> curly<00:01:20.070> hair<00:01:20.100> dolls<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.330> you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
like about curly hair dolls is that you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
like about curly hair dolls is that you
can<00:01:22.170> choose<00:01:22.470> how<00:01:22.680> large<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> rig

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
can choose how large you like the rig

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
can choose how large you like the rig
lips<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.560> one's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
lips to be so as you can see this one's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
lips to be so as you can see this one's
pretty<00:01:25.920> large<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.000> split<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> into

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
pretty large but if I just split it into

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230 
pretty large but if I just split it into
two<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.619> becomes<00:01:28.710> two<00:01:29.220> separate<00:01:29.610> smaller<00:01:29.939> ones

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
two it becomes two separate smaller ones

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
two it becomes two separate smaller ones
so<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> however<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so just do that however you like so I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
so just do that however you like so I
decided<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.189> wanted<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.790> smaller<00:01:36.270> ringlets

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
decided I wanted to do smaller ringlets

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
decided I wanted to do smaller ringlets
today<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.189> split<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
today so I kind of split them up so the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
today so I kind of split them up so the
next<00:01:39.659> step<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.740> spray<00:01:41.009> bottle

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
next step is to take your spray bottle

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.510 
next step is to take your spray bottle
and<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> spray<00:01:43.170> down<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:44.220> curl

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and you're going to spray down the curl

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
and you're going to spray down the curl
you're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.880> start<00:01:45.240> working<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're gonna start working with and be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.319 
you're gonna start working with and be
sure<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> cover<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.340> doll's<00:01:47.640> eyes<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.210> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
sure to cover your doll's eyes so they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.069 
sure to cover your doll's eyes so they
don't<00:01:48.509> rust<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:50.040> spray<00:01:50.460> away<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.600> her

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
don't rust and to spray away from her

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.889 
don't rust and to spray away from her
face<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.759> used<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.540> your

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
face so I used to think that your

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
face so I used to think that your
weren't<00:01:55.140> supposed<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> brush<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.670> really

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
weren't supposed to brush out really

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
weren't supposed to brush out really
curly<00:01:57.329> doll<00:01:57.479> hip<00:01:57.780> hair<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.860> would

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
curly doll hip hair because it would

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.090 
curly doll hip hair because it would
fall<00:01:59.159> out

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
fall out

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.539 
fall out
but<00:02:00.360> curly<00:02:01.360> doll<00:02:01.540> hair<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.200> way<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.310> seems

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
but curly doll hair is way so it seems

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.359 
but curly doll hair is way so it seems
curly<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:05.290> also<00:02:05.470> good<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.950> brush<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.250> out

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
curly and it's also good to brush it out

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.699 
curly and it's also good to brush it out
so<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.610> get<00:02:06.820> any<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> tangles<00:02:07.720> out<00:02:07.840> so

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so you get any of the tangles out so

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.990 
so you get any of the tangles out so
we're<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:08.950> gonna<00:02:09.190> take<00:02:09.369> our<00:02:09.520> brush<00:02:09.759> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
we're just gonna take our brush and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.100 
we're just gonna take our brush and
start<00:02:10.270> brushing<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.720> out<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> should<00:02:22.989> look

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
start brushing it out so it should look

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.809 
start brushing it out so it should look
something<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.310> next<00:02:24.459> step<00:02:24.790> is

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
something like this and the next step is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.520 
something like this and the next step is
just<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.540> twist<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.170> figure<00:02:29.380> out

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
just to twist it and you can figure out

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.870 
just to twist it and you can figure out
whatever<00:02:29.920> way<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.160> should<00:02:30.400> twist<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:30.850> is

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
whatever way you should twist here is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600 
whatever way you should twist here is
some<00:02:31.209> dolls<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:32.140> different<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.459> mine<00:02:33.580> I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
some dolls it's different so for mine I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.050 
some dolls it's different so for mine I
twist<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.269> doll<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.989> left<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.190> you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
twist the doll here to the left and you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.610 
twist the doll here to the left and you
just<00:02:37.239> let<00:02:37.450> go<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.050> have<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.410> nice

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
just let go and you have a really nice

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.280 
just let go and you have a really nice
curl<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.610> pretty<00:02:40.030> small<00:02:40.450> because<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:41.019> wet

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
curl it's pretty small because it's wet

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.229 
curl it's pretty small because it's wet
but<00:02:41.769> once<00:02:41.950> they<00:02:42.130> dry<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.580> will<00:02:42.610> kind<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.090> get

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
but once they dry they will kind of get

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.770 
but once they dry they will kind of get
more<00:02:43.450> volume<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.910> your<00:02:46.300> your<00:02:46.480> score<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
more volume so now your your score you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.540 
more volume so now your your score you
have<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.110> repeat<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.470> process<00:02:47.769> for<00:02:48.100> every

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
have to repeat that process for every

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.640 
have to repeat that process for every
single<00:02:48.940> curl<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.360> your<00:02:49.569> head<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.350> know<00:02:50.410> it's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
single curl on your head and I know it's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.170 
single curl on your head and I know it's
really<00:02:50.739> time-consuming<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> end<00:02:52.060> it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
really time-consuming but in the end it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.120 
really time-consuming but in the end it
turns<00:02:52.390> out<00:02:52.540> really<00:02:52.690> nice<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.620> I'm<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.010> gonna

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
turns out really nice so I'm just gonna

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:20.610 
turns out really nice so I'm just gonna
get<00:02:54.310> started<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.049> section<00:03:20.470> of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
get started so this is the section of

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.560 
get started so this is the section of
hair<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:21.010> I've<00:03:21.160> completed<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.090> it's<00:03:22.329> still

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
hair that I've completed and it's still

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.690 
hair that I've completed and it's still
pretty<00:03:22.750> damp<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:23.709> going<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:24.489> a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
pretty damp so it's going to be like a

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.990 
pretty damp so it's going to be like a
little<00:03:25.150> flat<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.560> will<00:03:26.980> come<00:03:27.280> back<00:03:27.489> after<00:03:27.790> a
