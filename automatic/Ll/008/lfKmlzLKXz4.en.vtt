00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
for the server's to level out because I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
for the server's to level out because I
fully<00:00:32.850> expected<00:00:33.420> GTA<00:00:33.780> online<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.440> work

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
characters and that sort of stuff so I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
of level itself out and there's not

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.130 
of level itself out and there's not
really<00:00:41.969> any<00:00:42.180> rush<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.899> game<00:00:43.110> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
single player is the same and fully

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
single player is the same and fully
relevant<00:01:44.040> those<00:01:44.220> videos<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> made<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
relevant those videos that I made and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
relevant those videos that I made and
apart<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> ones<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.009> mention

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
apart from the ones I'm about to mention

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
apart from the ones I'm about to mention
so<00:01:47.729> flying<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> most<00:01:48.630> notable<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.409> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so flying is the most notable one as you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
so flying is the most notable one as you
pre<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.250> from<00:01:50.460> single<00:01:50.820> player<00:01:51.030> every<00:01:51.450> 10

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
pre know from single player every 10

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.539 
pre know from single player every 10
minutes<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> spend<00:01:52.500> flying<00:01:52.860> increase

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
minutes that you spend flying increase

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.240 
minutes that you spend flying increase
that<00:01:53.850> stat<00:01:54.119> by<00:01:54.299> 1%<00:01:54.899> which<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> take<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that stat by 1% which is going to take a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.010 
that stat by 1% which is going to take a
very<00:01:56.700> very<00:01:56.790> long<00:01:57.509> time

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
very very long time

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
very very long time
but<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.770> single-player<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.369> flight

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
but in single-player there's flight

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.010 
but in single-player there's flight
school<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.360> rank<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.719> very<00:02:00.990> very

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
school where you could rank up very very

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
school where you could rank up very very
quickly<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.979> online<00:02:02.130> does<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.820> flight

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
quickly but online does not have flight

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.539 
quickly but online does not have flight
school<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.110> best<00:02:04.320> thing<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> very

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
school so the best thing to do is a very

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
school so the best thing to do is a very
common<00:02:05.820> tactic<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> people<00:02:06.600> using<00:02:06.930> right

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
common tactic that people using right

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.199 
common tactic that people using right
now<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> fly<00:02:08.429> an<00:02:08.550> aeroplane<00:02:08.700> into

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
now and that is to fly an aeroplane into

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
now and that is to fly an aeroplane into
the<00:02:09.300> sky<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.750> pin<00:02:09.929> elastic<00:02:10.259> band<00:02:10.470> new

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the sky and pin elastic band new

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
the sky and pin elastic band new
controller<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.610> hold<00:02:11.849> down<00:02:11.940> when<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
controller and that hold down when the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.710 
controller and that hold down when the
bumpers<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> flying<00:02:13.230> sir

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
bumpers see you flying sir

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.960 
bumpers see you flying sir
and<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.740> go<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.220> something<00:02:15.250> your

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and then you can go do something your

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.600 
and then you can go do something your
schoolwork<00:02:16.330> sleep<00:02:16.960> whatever<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.400> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
schoolwork sleep whatever and and you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.770 
schoolwork sleep whatever and and you
come<00:02:18.790> back<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.270> skill<00:02:19.540> would<00:02:19.660> have

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
come back in your skill would have

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.240 
come back in your skill would have
ranked<00:02:20.080> up<00:02:20.290> significantly

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
ranked up significantly

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.220 
ranked up significantly
probably<00:02:21.700> even<00:02:21.820> full<00:02:22.210> depending<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.930> how<00:02:23.050> long

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
probably even full depending on how long

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.080 
probably even full depending on how long
you're<00:02:23.380> gone<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.850> best

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you're gone so as of now that's the best

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.060 
you're gone so as of now that's the best
way<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.330> do<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.260> rock<00:02:26.560> start<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
way to do it and this rock start and the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.470 
way to do it and this rock start and the
future<00:02:27.250> want<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.670> add<00:02:27.790> some<00:02:28.000> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.210> flight

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
future want to add some kind of flight

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120 
future want to add some kind of flight
school<00:02:28.660> either<00:02:29.140> way<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> increase<00:02:29.920> your

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
school either way to increase your

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.730 
school either way to increase your
flying<00:02:30.490> stat<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> flying<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> say<00:02:32.560> is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
flying stat and as a flying as I say is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.500 
flying stat and as a flying as I say is
the<00:02:32.890> main<00:02:33.160> difference<00:02:33.490> everything<00:02:34.210> else<00:02:34.360> is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the main difference everything else is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.050 
the main difference everything else is
pretty<00:02:34.870> much<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.230> same<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.760> use<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
pretty much the same and you can use the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060 
pretty much the same and you can use the
elastic<00:02:37.450> band<00:02:37.720> trick<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.260> there<00:02:38.440> stealth<00:02:38.800> to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
elastic band trick on there stealth to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.710 
elastic band trick on there stealth to
just<00:02:39.280> go<00:02:39.400> into<00:02:39.580> stealth<00:02:39.790> mode<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.510> walk

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
just go into stealth mode and walk

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.900 
just go into stealth mode and walk
around<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.110> circles<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.220> yeah<00:02:42.610> if<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> want<00:02:42.850> to
