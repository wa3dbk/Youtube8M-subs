00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.029 

our<00:02:07.420> design<00:02:07.690> has<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:08.140> printed<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.860> then

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
our design has just printed and it then

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.370 
our design has just printed and it then
cut<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.910> are<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:10.119> ready<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> start<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
cut we are now ready to start the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.710 
cut we are now ready to start the
weeding<00:02:11.620> process<00:02:11.770> I've<00:02:12.400> cut<00:02:12.910> one<00:02:12.940> design<00:02:13.420> off

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
weeding process I've cut one design off

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.630 
weeding process I've cut one design off
so<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.290> show<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.440> how<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.490> done

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so it can just show you how this is done

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.060 
so it can just show you how this is done

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this is going on a dark shirt so we did

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.070 
this is going on a dark shirt so we did
put<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.520> very<00:03:01.790> small<00:03:01.880> white<00:03:02.450> key<00:03:02.690> line<00:03:02.870> around

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
put a very small white key line around

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.720 
put a very small white key line around
this<00:03:03.290> design<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.890> let<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.130> show<00:03:04.310> up<00:03:04.459> better<00:03:04.580> on

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
this design to let it show up better on

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.300 
this design to let it show up better on
the<00:03:04.940> design

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.420 

next<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.370> masking<00:03:12.790> process<00:03:14.040> peel<00:03:15.040> off<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
preference would be then we lift the

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:55.979 
preference would be then we lift the

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
image off of the carrier we saved the

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.500 
image off of the carrier we saved the
paper<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:56.950> came<00:03:57.129> on<00:03:57.160> because<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.239> makes<00:03:58.420> a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
paper that it came on because it makes a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.420 
paper that it came on because it makes a
nice<00:03:58.720> backer<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.709> don't<00:03:59.769> have<00:04:00.160> any

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
nice backer so that I don't have any

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.849 
nice backer so that I don't have any
yeah<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.810> mask<00:04:01.989> doesn't<00:04:02.290> stick<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.530> anything

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
yeah the mask doesn't stick to anything

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.580 
yeah the mask doesn't stick to anything

I<00:04:40.460> like<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.509> cover<00:04:41.720> at<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.169> point<00:04:43.030> we're

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
I like the cover at this point we're

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.840 
I like the cover at this point we're
gonna<00:04:44.150> apply<00:04:44.419> this<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.660> 305<00:04:45.320> degrees<00:04:45.639> for<00:04:46.639> five

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
gonna apply this a 305 degrees for five

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.180 
gonna apply this a 305 degrees for five
seconds<00:04:47.300> using<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:47.690> nice<00:04:47.870> firm<00:04:48.139> pressure

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.300 

take<00:04:54.850> off<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.180> cover<00:04:55.360> sheet<00:04:56.160> we'll<00:04:57.160> let<00:04:57.280> it

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
take off the cover sheet we'll let it

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:06.190 
take off the cover sheet we'll let it
cool<00:04:57.550> for<00:04:57.790> just<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:58.120> few<00:04:58.330> seconds

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:18.270 

then<00:05:06.860> we'll<00:05:07.010> lift<00:05:07.130> off<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.490> mask

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.790 

we'll<00:05:19.280> cover<00:05:19.460> again<00:05:19.819> and<00:05:20.090> I'm<00:05:20.449> using<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.960> craft

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
we'll cover again and I'm using a craft

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.279 
we'll cover again and I'm using a craft
sheet<00:05:22.129> it<00:05:22.430> has<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.580> silicone<00:05:23.000> eyes<00:05:23.120> paper<00:05:23.389> this

sheet it has a silicone eyes paper this

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.839 
sheet it has a silicone eyes paper this
will<00:05:24.440> help<00:05:24.650> dull<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.039> image<00:05:25.310> give<00:05:25.520> you<00:05:25.610> more

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
will help dull the image give you more

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.390 
will help dull the image give you more
of<00:05:25.879> a<00:05:26.000> satin<00:05:26.210> luster<00:05:26.919> we'll<00:05:27.919> press<00:05:28.099> it<00:05:28.129> again

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
of a satin luster we'll press it again

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.999 
of a satin luster we'll press it again
for<00:05:28.550> another<00:05:28.729> five<00:05:29.090> seconds<00:05:29.860> that<00:05:30.860> will

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
for another five seconds that will

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.589 
for another five seconds that will
complete<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.340> design<00:05:31.819> you<00:05:32.210> could<00:05:32.360> use<00:05:32.569> a

complete the design you could use a

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.909 
complete the design you could use a
