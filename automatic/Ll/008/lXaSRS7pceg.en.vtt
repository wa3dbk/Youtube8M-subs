 tutorial to wake up today

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:15.280
 chocolate lollipops that are 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:19.980
 very good they are very easy to make 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.980
 and you will not regret doing it 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.599
 next I'll show you the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.570
 materials that they will use to make 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.110
 these 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.040
 plastic bags with chocolate closure 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 black white a brown with milk 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.540
 preferably sticks that are short 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.010
 gave them are long but good of equal and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.010
 oven paper 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.910
 i 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.989
 and optional these edible paintings 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.150
 that are from doctor esker and shavings of 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.980
 chocolate let's start making these 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.250
 lollipops first let's warm up 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.920
 our ceramic hob and in a pot 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.900
 big let's put water and let's 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.330
 let it get hot while it 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 warms let's cut chocolate with a 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 knife in small pieces 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 and we're going to put in a saucepan over 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.230
 small of which we have exposed 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.840
 heating the water to fit inside 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.420
 since we have a and chocolate cut 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 let's put in the small capsule 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 inside the large gate in which 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.650
 there is water and this is what is called a bath 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.479
 boiler and as water will heat the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
 which is inside the small capsule 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.380
 was to heat also and it's going to melt 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 as you can see there is chocolate and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.610
 while we are going to cut into my chopsticks 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.720
 that as they are small but if I have to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 cut with scissors and as you see then the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 water is burning and what is inside 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.229
 of the small casserole as it is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.149
 melting in this case chocolate with 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 We use a spatula or something to help 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.649
 melts better and since it has 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.649
 melted and quickly we carry a 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.899
 table because it pulls fast enough and in 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.420
 the plastic bag that preferably 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.970
 that has a closure and that is quite 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.170
 resistant with a spoon we are going to put 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 the melted chocolate 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.530
 very carefully because this burns and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.480
 If you are not going to study everything 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.160
 since we have put all the chocolate 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.890
 inside we are going to take all the chocolate 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.950
 down the bag towards a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 corner and in the corner we are going to take 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.670
 scissors 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.569
 we're going to take the chocolate out of there 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.250
 corner let's take some scissors and 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.530
 let's make a hole in the tip like this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.150
 from that hole the chocolate will come out and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.319
 we can do the ways that we 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.060
 we want is quite comfortable and some 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.190
 incredible shapes 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.690
 if you have molds to make this kind of 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.150
 figures that you can use me for my 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.060
 I did not have them as I did 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.769
 by hand the forms did not come out so 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.950
 well but then when they dry 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:16.680
 we decorate them a little bit and that 's it 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.549
 you can make stars circles 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.840
 moons hearts what you want 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.540
 also this procedure can you 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.609
 make with white chocolate or mix it 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.879
 with white chocolate with chocolate 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.180
 black so that it's milk chocolate and 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:36.090
 then we put the chopsticks and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.950
 Let it dry for an hour or a 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.750
 half an hour and as you see then also the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.269
 you can make with white chocolate and 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.099
 mixed black and I have these 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.129
 colored pencils that are edible 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.959
 of ' ed doctor's core what do you want you can 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.530
 buy in the supermarket as I have 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.900
 painted and they have been beautiful and 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 we are done with these 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.700
 first of chocolate that are easy to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.010
