00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.849
 Hi, dear friends, I am a master league 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.400
 still not sleeping I would like to show you 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.500
 conference and following which issues on 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.740
 not the usual candy and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 marmalade has long wanted to do 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.910
 candy which gives marmalade but 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.119
 hands never reached 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:38.719
 so let me first load our 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.719
 marmalade like we have a bear there and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:50.640
 close, sorry 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 and so the lever we unfortunately often do not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 it works we need to insert 2 rubles there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.210
 I would also like to tell you that sometimes 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.559
 Anna mechanism candy for some reason not 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:10.520
 works and on why well here we take 2 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:16.009
 ruble throw there to turn the lever 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 there is nothing and now you drive a bear 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.960
 such a regular bear and I think you already 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.450
 then there is how this bank opens it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.049
 opens in the easiest way 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 eat take a cotton swab 10 hole 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 before we insert and open the bank to know and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.420
 check paste here 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.420
 bank opened 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.520
 Now I can not get that key 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:55.370
 It had to get on here on the Thing's eyes 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:02:02.140
 shove gat our 2 rubles sometimes 2 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.140
 the ruble to the spokes is hard not got 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 closing the bank and our hook back 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.520
 coming forward now let's show 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 you would also like this mechanism 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.430
 ask why are you under my past 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.660
 video wrote that this is plagiarism though 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.750
 some kind of plagiarism because I 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 the video said it stayed done by 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.050
 instructions, that is, I did not invent it myself 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.320
 still writing plagiarism here 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 the mechanism is the usual mechanism only he 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:46.330
 logical view we see us here now 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 locked here we can't move 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:55.910
 mechanism teddy bear licks here he 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:01.130
 so far so his way reborn he 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:04.430
 can not fall there now we take 2 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.160
 ruble throw here with one ruble is not 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.870
 it turns out well that the ruble, he just will 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.400
 fly 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.660
 here there is no return of money that is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.120
 if you give 1 ruble 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.790
 is 1 ruble you have returned this 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.670
 no, well, it's like a reduced 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.690
 candy candy here and this is only two rose 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.810
 take rubles 2 rubles throw them here 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.150
 we are raised by this mechanism this is it and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.000
 let his rubles fall mechanism here 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.769
 rises and the mechanism doesn't move here 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.769
 our bear is falling 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.989
 when we turn that is the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:56.680
 Moving bear falls here such here 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:59.739
 simple mechanism of this candy think 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.680
 did you like such a review to write 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.250
 different ideas that I build a well that 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.010
 the idea is already getting small and I don't know 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.980
 that already have to build I very well 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.319
 many buildings made of lego that's all 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.350
 thanks for watching everyone good luck and everyone 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.350
 until
