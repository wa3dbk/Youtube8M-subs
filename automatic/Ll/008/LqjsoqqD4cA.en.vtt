00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 welcome to niklas 11 12 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today I would like to have the one ddr 992 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 iks middle a video gtx 780 video card 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.710
 Compare should compare is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 Of course, never one hundred percent fair 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 but I always try and the best there 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.380
 the prices just not really 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 Comparable when it comes to amd and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 nvidia gpu it comes however they are from 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 Price yes, somehow comparable 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.199
 the a 9 92 ex, however, costs a small 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.329
 a little bit more than the GTX 480 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 I should also let you know 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.840
 that I only had the opportunity 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.530
 those of your friends designs these cards 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.390
 to test 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 the performance would thus at aftermarket 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 do not forget designs better 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.850
 But we finish that equipment and come 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 Let's get straight to the benchmarks 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 well we have seen itself there are a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.530
 few really interesting results 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.670
 But always have the pricing in the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.310
 keep in mind 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.950
 In terms of performance, the amd 1 brings 992 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.320
 ex more power than the nvidia luggage 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.750
 780 but the differences depending on the game 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.520
 are sometimes quite big and sometimes 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.040
 just very low 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.760
 whether it is worth the money here to the r 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.110
 To grab 29 ex is questionable 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.970
 Power consumers temperatures are up 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.620
 a ds card also higher 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.869
 of course that's the reference design 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.790
 So that temperature problem should be at 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.560
 be first resolved brand design 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 but the power consumption remains 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.910
 higher than the gtx 780 i would 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 say that the choice of the profit 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.360
 between these two cards here only 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.430
 very difficult to determine 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.390
 but I tend here to a video 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.310
 getec 780 the amd r29 represents the better 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380
 choice if you are against the big one 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.940
 sister of getec 780 he compares 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.709
 the getec 7.80 2 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.660
 Of course, even if you the price 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.340
 nevertheless respects the performance ratio 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.750
 In the end, your decisions are not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.459
 I mean I hope I could 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.260
 somehow help with the election 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.239
