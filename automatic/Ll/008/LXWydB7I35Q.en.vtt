00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
realize that Peter Parker was in fact

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.220 
realize that Peter Parker was in fact
spider-man<00:01:55.210> now<00:01:55.630> he's<00:01:55.780> trying<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.080> tell

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
spider-man now he's trying to tell

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.480 
spider-man now he's trying to tell
everyone<00:01:56.470> this<00:01:56.650> he's<00:01:56.830> trying<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.190> make

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
everyone this he's trying to like make

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.490 
everyone this he's trying to like make
them<00:01:57.700> understand<00:01:58.270> what's<00:01:58.930> going<00:01:59.260> on<00:01:59.380> and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
them understand what's going on and

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.020 
them understand what's going on and
everything<00:01:59.770> like<00:01:59.890> that<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.670> think<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
everything like that and I think the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.570 
everything like that and I think the
humor<00:02:01.480> from<00:02:01.750> flash<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:02.800> absolutely

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
humor from flash is just absolutely

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.400 
humor from flash is just absolutely
brilliant<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.570> mean<00:02:04.600> he's<00:02:04.840> talking<00:02:05.020> about<00:02:05.320> how

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
brilliant I mean he's talking about how

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.219 
brilliant I mean he's talking about how
he<00:02:05.470> got<00:02:05.650> bit<00:02:05.890> by<00:02:05.920> be<00:02:06.430> well<00:02:06.730> stung<00:02:07.030> baby<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.720> now

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
he got bit by be well stung baby and now

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.900 
he got bit by be well stung baby and now
he's<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.590> be<00:02:08.890> man<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.369> stuff<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.879> I

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
he's not be man and stuff like that I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.910 
he's not be man and stuff like that I
thought<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.179> was<00:02:10.390> hilarious<00:02:10.860> something<00:02:11.860> I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
thought that was hilarious something I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.770 
thought that was hilarious something I
should<00:02:12.099> also<00:02:12.220> mention<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:13.030> flash<00:02:13.390> also

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
should also mention is that flash also

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.679 
should also mention is that flash also
says<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.260> spider-man<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.129> six<00:02:15.549> feet<00:02:15.760> tall<00:02:16.030> so

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
says that spider-man is six feet tall so

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.569 
says that spider-man is six feet tall so
Peter<00:02:17.200> surely<00:02:17.560> can't<00:02:17.890> be<00:02:17.980> spider-man<00:02:18.430> because

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
Peter surely can't be spider-man because

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.080 
Peter surely can't be spider-man because
these<00:02:18.760> are

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
these are

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
these are
bit<00:02:19.180> smaller<00:02:19.510> well<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.080> think<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.800> answer<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
bit smaller well I think the answer to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
bit smaller well I think the answer to
that<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.970> fact<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.390> Peter<00:02:22.930> kind<00:02:23.319> of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
that is the fact that Peter kind of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440 
that is the fact that Peter kind of
holds<00:02:23.709> himself<00:02:23.860> tall<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.300> he

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
holds himself tall you know like he

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.420 
holds himself tall you know like he
stands<00:02:25.840> straight<00:02:26.230> he<00:02:26.410> stands<00:02:26.739> powerful<00:02:27.310> when

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
stands straight he stands powerful when

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
stands straight he stands powerful when
he<00:02:27.519> spider-man<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.300> when<00:02:28.420> he's<00:02:28.540> Peter<00:02:28.780> Parker

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
he spider-man but when he's Peter Parker

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.869 
he spider-man but when he's Peter Parker
he's<00:02:29.709> got<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> kind<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:30.160> blending<00:02:30.610> he's<00:02:30.700> gotta

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
he's got a kind of blending he's gotta

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.699 
he's got a kind of blending he's gotta
make<00:02:30.910> himself<00:02:31.239> seem<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.110> nerd<00:02:32.349> he's<00:02:32.590> got

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.949 
make himself seem like the nerd he's got

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.339 
future so I suppose in the mozzarella's
comics<00:04:04.150> she's<00:04:04.419> pretty<00:04:04.630> much<00:04:04.750> grown<00:04:05.019> up<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.319> bit

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and of course what's been going on in

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
and of course what's been going on in
school<00:04:12.669> and<00:04:12.790> everything<00:04:13.060> like<00:04:13.209> that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
school and everything like that

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.750 
school and everything like that
and<00:04:13.599> he's<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.440> little<00:04:14.739> bit<00:04:14.829> rundown<00:04:15.040> about<00:04:15.579> that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and he's a little bit rundown about that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.339 
and he's a little bit rundown about that
if<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.239> remember<00:04:16.570> correctly<00:04:16.870> as<00:04:17.019> well<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.200> think

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
if I remember correctly as well I think

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.560 
if I remember correctly as well I think
when<00:04:17.799> Stacy's<00:04:18.280> behavior<00:04:18.789> kind<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.120> takes<00:04:19.359> its

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
when Stacy's behavior kind of takes its

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.170 
when Stacy's behavior kind of takes its
toll<00:04:19.810> on<00:04:20.190> Captain<00:04:21.190> George<00:04:21.340> Stacy<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:22.000> his

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
toll on Captain George Stacy and his

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.129 
toll on Captain George Stacy and his
wife's<00:04:22.419> relationship<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.560> think<00:04:24.190> inevitably

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
wife's relationship I think inevitably

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.149 
wife's relationship I think inevitably
Wednesday's<00:04:26.139> his<00:04:26.320> mom<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.680> dad<00:04:26.830> end<00:04:27.010> up

Wednesday's his mom and dad end up

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.140 
Wednesday's his mom and dad end up
splitting<00:04:27.490> off<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:27.760> something<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.090> that

splitting off or something like that

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.240 
splitting off or something like that
