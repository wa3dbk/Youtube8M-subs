all<00:00:01.199> right<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.949> gonna<00:00:02.040> go<00:00:02.310> over<00:00:02.340> wim

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
all right so we're gonna go over wim

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.930 
all right so we're gonna go over wim
images<00:00:03.659> now<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> wim<00:00:04.799> image<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.640> wim

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
images now what is a wim image and a wim

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.810 
images now what is a wim image and a wim
image<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.629> kind<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.290> like<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.680> ghost<00:00:08.160> image<00:00:08.400> or<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
image is kind of like a ghost image or a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.650 
image is kind of like a ghost image or a
ping<00:00:09.179> image<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.809> basically<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.969> snapshot<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
ping image it's basically a snapshot of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.039 
ping image it's basically a snapshot of
an<00:00:13.110> entire<00:00:13.530> operating<00:00:14.250> system<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.809> allows

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
an entire operating system and it allows

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.140 
an entire operating system and it allows
you<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.770> clone<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.310> operating<00:00:17.970> system<00:00:18.619> and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
you to clone that operating system and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.019 
you to clone that operating system and
so<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.480> you've<00:00:21.750> ever<00:00:21.930> installed<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:23.029> Windows

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so if you've ever installed a Windows

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.630 
so if you've ever installed a Windows
operating<00:00:24.180> system<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.109> Vista<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:25.830> higher

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
operating system with Vista or higher

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.000 
operating system with Vista or higher
then<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.359> used<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.960> wim<00:00:28.199> image<00:00:28.349> because

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
then you have used a wim image because

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.920 
then you have used a wim image because
they<00:00:29.279> use<00:00:29.580> wim<00:00:29.880> images<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.630> deploy<00:00:31.560> those

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
they use wim images to deploy those

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520 
they use wim images to deploy those
recent<00:00:33.930> versions<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> Windows<00:00:34.910> now<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.960> thing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
recent versions of Windows now the thing

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
recent versions of Windows now the thing
I'm<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> talk<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.760> called<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I'm going to talk about is called the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.950 
I'm going to talk about is called the
windows<00:00:40.410> automated<00:00:41.070> installation<00:00:41.309> kit<00:00:42.149> which

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
windows automated installation kit which

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.880 
windows automated installation kit which
is<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.640> development<00:00:44.640> tool<00:00:45.210> suite<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.320> allows

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is a development tool suite that allows

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.860 
is a development tool suite that allows
you<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.340> create<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:47.969> own<00:00:48.210> wim<00:00:49.200> images<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
you to create your own wim images and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.670 
you to create your own wim images and
automates<00:00:51.870> deploying<00:00:52.559> images<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.530> let's<00:00:55.530> look

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
automates deploying images so let's look

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
automates deploying images so let's look
at<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> couple<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.610> advantages<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.539> women

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
at a couple of advantages of women

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
at a couple of advantages of women
adjust<00:00:58.530> their<00:00:58.800> Hardware<00:00:59.340> independent<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
adjust their Hardware independent so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.319 
adjust their Hardware independent so
they<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.710> deployed<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.329> different

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
they can be deployed to different

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
they can be deployed to different
hardware<00:01:03.780> configurations<00:01:04.769> without<00:01:05.670> any

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hardware configurations without any

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
hardware configurations without any
trouble<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.500> multiple<00:01:07.950> images

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
trouble you can have multiple images

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
trouble you can have multiple images
within<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.900> wim<00:01:10.409> image<00:01:10.650> file<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
within one wim image file so you can

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
within one wim image file so you can
store<00:01:14.490> different<00:01:15.090> configuration<00:01:16.020> types

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
store different configuration types

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
store different configuration types
within<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.950> file<00:01:17.280> rather<00:01:17.700> than<00:01:17.970> having

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
within one file rather than having

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.249 
within one file rather than having
multiple<00:01:18.900> files<00:01:20.540> they<00:01:21.540> feature<00:01:21.810> image

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
multiple files they feature image

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.819 
multiple files they feature image
compression<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.070> single<00:01:23.520> instant<00:01:23.939> storage

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.530 

is<00:01:28.829> within<00:01:29.390> one<00:01:30.390> wim<00:01:31.020> file<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.979> those<00:01:32.939> images

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
is within one wim file and those images

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.580 
is within one wim file and those images
share<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.619> same<00:01:34.860> file<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.700> doesn't<00:01:36.590> duplicate

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
share the same file it doesn't duplicate

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
share the same file it doesn't duplicate
that<00:01:37.920> data<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.640> simply<00:01:39.479> creates<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.960> reference

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that data it simply creates a reference

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
that data it simply creates a reference
to<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.280> file<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.369> if<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.729> have

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
to that one file and so if you have

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.490 
to that one file and so if you have
three<00:01:45.740> operating<00:01:46.740> systems<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.729> file<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
three operating systems on one file and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.410 
three operating systems on one file and
they're<00:01:49.799> similar<00:01:50.070> operating<00:01:50.700> systems<00:01:51.149> with

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
they're similar operating systems with

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.679 
they're similar operating systems with
just<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.079> file<00:01:52.740> differences<00:01:53.509> only<00:01:54.509> those

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
just some file differences only those

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
just some file differences only those
extra<00:01:55.170> file<00:01:55.439> differences<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.700> more

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
extra file differences will take up more

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.429 
extra file differences will take up more
space<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:58.049> efficient<00:01:58.500> way<00:01:58.530> of

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
space so it's a really efficient way of

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.920 
space so it's a really efficient way of
utilizing<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.219> space<00:02:02.850> within<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> image

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
utilizing the space within the image

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.819 
utilizing the space within the image
file<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.850> service<00:02:06.149> images<00:02:06.780> offline<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
file you can service images offline so

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
file you can service images offline so
you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.729> take<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> wim<00:02:09.239> file<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.200> can

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
you can take a wim file and you can

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.970 
you can take a wim file and you can
mount<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.700> folder<00:02:12.379> logically

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
mount it to a folder logically

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.660 
mount it to a folder logically
your<00:02:15.200> desktop<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.160> add<00:02:17.370> files

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
your desktop and then you can add files

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.320 
your desktop and then you can add files
to<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.239> or<00:02:18.450> remove<00:02:19.050> files<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.760> many<00:02:21.060> other

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to it or remove files and do many other

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.910 
to it or remove files and do many other
things<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.520> deploy<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.300> any

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
things with it you can deploy to any

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
things with it you can deploy to any
size<00:02:25.920> hard<00:02:26.250> drive<00:02:26.489> basically<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.420> way<00:02:27.569> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
size hard drive basically the way it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.760 
size hard drive basically the way it
works<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.250> use<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> different<00:02:30.090> program<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
works is you use a different program and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.860 
works is you use a different program and
Microsoft<00:02:32.340> provides<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.120> called<00:02:33.300> disk<00:02:33.569> part

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
Microsoft provides one called disk part

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.330 
Microsoft provides one called disk part
to<00:02:34.410> format<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.730> hard<00:02:35.970> drive<00:02:36.300> before<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.830> do

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
to format the hard drive before you do

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.640 
to format the hard drive before you do
the<00:02:38.520> wim<00:02:38.870> deployment<00:02:39.870> or<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.230> wim<00:02:40.410> image

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
the wim deployment or the wim image

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.270 
the wim deployment or the wim image
impress<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.269> wim<00:02:42.450> image<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:43.650> basically<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
impress so the wim image is basically a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.050 
impress so the wim image is basically a
file<00:02:44.790> copy<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.069> first<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.400> run<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.760> program

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
file copy so first you run this program

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
file copy so first you run this program
to<00:02:48.600> wipe<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.140> hard<00:02:49.290> drive<00:02:49.530> completely<00:02:49.890> format

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to wipe the hard drive completely format

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.360 
to wipe the hard drive completely format
it<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.209> its<00:02:51.390> full<00:02:52.110> size<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.650> partitions<00:02:53.250> or

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it to its full size or partitions or

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.630 
it to its full size or partitions or
whatever<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.360> want<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:56.280> if

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
whatever you want it to do and then if

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.670 
whatever you want it to do and then if
there's<00:02:57.120> enough<00:02:57.450> space<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.780> copy<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
there's enough space to copy all the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
there's enough space to copy all the
files<00:02:58.709> from<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> wim<00:02:59.610> image<00:02:59.930> it'll<00:03:00.930> it'll

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
files from the wim image it'll it'll

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.199 
files from the wim image it'll it'll
work<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.130> don't<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.640> worry<00:03:02.880> about<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
work so you don't have to worry about I

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.030 
work so you don't have to worry about I
know<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:03.600> ghost<00:03:03.870> there's<00:03:04.080> issues<00:03:04.319> with<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
know with ghost there's issues with is

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.390 
know with ghost there's issues with is
this<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> right<00:03:05.850> hard<00:03:06.510> drive<00:03:06.780> size<00:03:07.400> because

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
this the right hard drive size because

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.190 
this the right hard drive size because
sometimes<00:03:08.850> they<00:03:09.120> don't<00:03:09.299> expand<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.110> have

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
sometimes they don't expand and you have

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440 
sometimes they don't expand and you have
to<00:03:10.410> do<00:03:11.400> different<00:03:11.760> things<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to do different things you don't have to

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.800 
to do different things you don't have to
worry<00:03:12.630> about<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:14.030> there's<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.180> API

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
worry about that with this there's a API

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.130 
worry about that with this there's a API
provided<00:03:16.549> diello<00:03:17.549> DLL<00:03:18.269> file<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.959> can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
provided diello DLL file that you can

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.460 
provided diello DLL file that you can
use<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.880> manipulate<00:03:21.570> wim<00:03:22.170> files

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
use to manipulate wim files

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.310 
use to manipulate wim files
programmatically<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:25.140> a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
programmatically and it is a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.349 
programmatically and it is a
non-destructive<00:03:25.980> deployment<00:03:26.910> like<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.180> said

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
non-destructive deployment like I said

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.960 
non-destructive deployment like I said
before<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.200> mean<00:03:28.470> essentially<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.070> file

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
before it's so I mean essentially a file

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.750 
before it's so I mean essentially a file
copy<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:32.160> doesn't<00:03:32.489> delete

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
copy really so it doesn't delete

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.430 
copy really so it doesn't delete
anything<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.480> hard<00:03:33.690> drive<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.200> just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
anything on the hard drive it just

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.680 
anything on the hard drive it just
copies<00:03:35.400> its<00:03:36.269> data<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.890> drive<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.510> it's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
copies its data to the drive so it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.349 
copies its data to the drive so it's
non-destructive<00:03:40.549> now<00:03:41.549> those<00:03:41.880> are<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.299> couple

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
non-destructive now those are a couple

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.170 
non-destructive now those are a couple
of<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:44.150> advantages<00:03:45.150> let's<00:03:45.630> take<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> look<00:03:46.200> at<00:03:46.320> a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
of the advantages let's take a look at a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.509 
of the advantages let's take a look at a
little<00:03:48.180> diagram<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.560> made<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.070> kind<00:03:50.400> of

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
little diagram I made that kind of

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.759 
little diagram I made that kind of
explains<00:03:50.940> how<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.299> works<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:52.290> we're<00:03:52.620> talking

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
explains how it works so we're talking

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.090 
explains how it works so we're talking
about<00:03:53.010> wim<00:03:53.459> right<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.350> way<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
about wim right now and the way that you

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.660 
about wim right now and the way that you
work<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.579> wim<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:57.150> through<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:58.459> Exe<00:03:59.459> called

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
work with wim is through this Exe called

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.080 
work with wim is through this Exe called
image<00:04:00.090> X<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:00.720> that's<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:02.069> wood<00:04:02.459> wood<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
image X and that's it in wood wood this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.699 
image X and that's it in wood wood this
executable<00:04:03.660> we<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.230> capture<00:04:04.940> modify<00:04:05.940> append

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
executable we can capture modify append

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.069 
executable we can capture modify append
mount<00:04:07.709> our<00:04:07.859> images<00:04:08.400> split<00:04:09.180> our<00:04:09.359> images<00:04:09.900> they

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
mount our images split our images they

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.559 
mount our images split our images they
can<00:04:10.139> be<00:04:10.290> split<00:04:11.100> up<00:04:11.130> into<00:04:11.459> equally<00:04:12.329> sized

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
can be split up into equally sized

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.300 
can be split up into equally sized
chunks<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:15.569> like<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.200> talked<00:04:16.650> about<00:04:16.769> before

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
chunks and so like I talked about before

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.360 
chunks and so like I talked about before
within<00:04:18.120> 1:1<00:04:18.840> wim<00:04:19.139> file<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.220> have

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
within 1:1 wim file you can have

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.350 
within 1:1 wim file you can have
multiple<00:04:20.970> images<00:04:21.890> and<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.669> how<00:04:24.030> would<00:04:24.090> you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
multiple images and so how would you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.280 
multiple images and so how would you
identify<00:04:24.800> which<00:04:25.800> images<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.490> want<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.760> use

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
identify which images you want to use

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.710 
identify which images you want to use
well<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:28.370> can<00:04:28.580> designate<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.570> an<00:04:30.560> index<00:04:31.100> name

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
well you can designate a an index name

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.290 
well you can designate a an index name
for<00:04:33.220> identification<00:04:34.220> if<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.580> want<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.910> create

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
for identification if you want to create

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.920 
for identification if you want to create
your<00:04:35.480> own<00:04:35.540> unique<00:04:36.010> name<00:04:37.010> identifier<00:04:37.670> but<00:04:38.360> also

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
your own unique name identifier but also

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.930 
your own unique name identifier but also
there's<00:04:39.380> an<00:04:39.620> index<00:04:40.040> number<00:04:40.130> which<00:04:40.670> gets

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
there's an index number which gets

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.470 
there's an index number which gets
incremented<00:04:41.330> every<00:04:41.780> time<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.320> add<00:04:42.530> an<00:04:42.830> image

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
incremented every time you add an image

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.690 
incremented every time you add an image
or<00:04:44.480> every<00:04:44.930> time<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.260> append<00:04:45.650> an<00:04:45.830> image<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.460> an

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
or every time you append an image to an

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.480 
or every time you append an image to an
existing<00:04:47.600> image<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.770> number<00:04:49.010> would

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
existing image so this number would

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.570 
existing image so this number would
increase<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:50.210> when<00:04:50.930> you're<00:04:51.230> telling<00:04:52.040> image<00:04:52.310> X

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
increase and when you're telling image X

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.820 
increase and when you're telling image X
to<00:04:52.880> apply<00:04:53.330> an<00:04:53.510> image<00:04:53.690> somewhere<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.680> would

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
to apply an image somewhere you would

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.100 
to apply an image somewhere you would
just<00:04:54.980> tell<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.400> either<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.150> index<00:04:56.540> number<00:04:56.630> or

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
just tell it either the index number or

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.140 
just tell it either the index number or
the<00:04:57.530> index<00:04:57.860> name<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.670> just<00:04:58.850> kind<00:04:58.910> of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
the index name and this is just kind of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.490 
the index name and this is just kind of
a<00:04:59.270> visual<00:04:59.780> representation<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.880> how<00:05:01.880> the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
a visual representation of how the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.380 
a visual representation of how the
single<00:05:03.500> instance<00:05:04.070> storage<00:05:04.730> works

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
single instance storage works

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.620 
single instance storage works
so<00:05:05.900> since<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.490> first<00:05:07.700> copy<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:08.390> is

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
so since this is the first copy this is

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.940 
so since this is the first copy this is
all<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.770> data<00:05:10.040> for<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.090> Windows<00:05:11.690> XP<00:05:12.200> but

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
all the data for that Windows XP but

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.540 
all the data for that Windows XP but
let's<00:05:13.130> say<00:05:13.340> we<00:05:14.000> also<00:05:14.390> added<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.290> XP<00:05:15.950> Pro<00:05:16.190> Service

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
let's say we also added a XP Pro Service

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.120 
let's say we also added a XP Pro Service
Pack<00:05:16.730> 1<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:17.870> let's<00:05:18.290> say<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.590> was<00:05:18.740> Windows

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
Pack 1 to this let's say it was Windows

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.740 
Pack 1 to this let's say it was Windows
Home<00:05:19.750> it<00:05:20.750> wouldn't<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.310> add<00:05:22.730> as<00:05:23.360> much

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
Home it wouldn't have to add as much

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.890 
Home it wouldn't have to add as much
information<00:05:24.790> because<00:05:25.790> all<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.570> core

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
information because all of the core

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.440 
information because all of the core
Windows<00:05:27.290> XP<00:05:27.740> files<00:05:28.010> are<00:05:28.280> here<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.700> they<00:05:29.150> share

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
Windows XP files are here and they share

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.170 
Windows XP files are here and they share
those<00:05:29.660> files<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.380> only<00:05:30.620> those<00:05:31.460> differences

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
those files so only those differences

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.160 
those files so only those differences
would<00:05:33.340> would<00:05:34.340> exist<00:05:35.210> for<00:05:35.570> this<00:05:36.470> image<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:38.170> so

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
would would exist for this image and so

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.920 
would would exist for this image and so
this<00:05:39.500> third<00:05:39.770> one<00:05:39.950> here<00:05:40.220> is<00:05:40.310> basically<00:05:40.730> XP<00:05:41.690> Pro

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
this third one here is basically XP Pro

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.280 
this third one here is basically XP Pro
with<00:05:42.200> service<00:05:42.620> pack<00:05:42.830> 2<00:05:43.070> so<00:05:43.340> it<00:05:43.430> has<00:05:43.580> very<00:05:44.290> few

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
with service pack 2 so it has very few

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.620 
with service pack 2 so it has very few
files<00:05:45.560> because<00:05:46.070> they're<00:05:46.280> similar<00:05:46.630> operating

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
files because they're similar operating

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.320 
files because they're similar operating
systems<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.950> reference<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:50.000> files

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
systems and it can reference the files

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.180 
systems and it can reference the files
from<00:05:50.720> here<00:05:51.170> and<00:05:51.350> from<00:05:52.010> here<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:53.740> fully<00:05:54.740> produce

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
from here and from here to fully produce

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.120 
from here and from here to fully produce
this<00:05:55.580> image<00:05:55.970> here<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:56.420> here's<00:05:57.350> a<00:05:57.410> Windows<00:05:57.770> 7

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
this image here and here's a Windows 7

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.340 
this image here and here's a Windows 7
which<00:05:58.340> takes<00:05:58.670> up<00:05:58.880> all<00:05:59.090> its<00:05:59.600> data<00:05:59.810> because<00:06:00.200> it's

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
which takes up all its data because it's

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.770 
which takes up all its data because it's
not<00:06:00.560> similar<00:06:00.950> to<00:06:01.310> these<00:06:02.000> other<00:06:02.210> files<00:06:02.450> so

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
not similar to these other files so

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.610 
not similar to these other files so
that's<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:03.260> quick<00:06:03.890> look<00:06:03.950> at<00:06:04.550> how<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:05.620> single

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
that's a quick look at how the single

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.530 
that's a quick look at how the single
instance<00:06:06.980> instance<00:06:07.910> storage<00:06:08.300> works<00:06:09.220> and

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
instance instance storage works and

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.510 
instance instance storage works and
that's<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.050> that's<00:06:12.170> a<00:06:12.410> quick<00:06:12.800> introduction

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
that's it so that's a quick introduction

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.870 
that's it so that's a quick introduction
on<00:06:13.610> why<00:06:14.450> women<00:06:14.930> ajiz<00:06:15.470> are<00:06:15.650> really<00:06:15.950> cool<00:06:16.190> but

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
the next video we'll get to the command

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.670 
the next video we'll get to the command
line<00:06:22.220> and<00:06:22.550> we'll<00:06:22.820> look<00:06:23.030> at<00:06:23.210> how<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.420> create<00:06:24.290> wim

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
line and we'll look at how to create wim

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.070 
line and we'll look at how to create wim
images<00:06:25.250> and<00:06:25.490> how<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.120> mount<00:06:26.450> them<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:26.720> how<00:06:27.020> to
