who<00:01:38.729> created<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> figure<00:01:39.899> are<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> such

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
who created this figure are just such

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
who created this figure are just such
geniuses<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.429> way<00:01:41.550> they<00:01:41.729> use<00:01:41.910> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
geniuses for the way they use the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
geniuses for the way they use the
articulation<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.959> thing<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.679> going<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
articulation on this thing I'm going to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.719 
articulation on this thing I'm going to
go<00:01:44.009> over<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.250> articulation<00:01:44.940> first<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
go over the articulation first so the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.449 
go over the articulation first so the
head<00:01:47.940> moves<00:01:48.259> 360<00:01:49.259> degrees<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.950> wanted<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
head moves 360 degrees if you wanted it

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.499 
head moves 360 degrees if you wanted it
to<00:01:50.489> the<00:01:51.770> head<00:01:52.770> also<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.610> move<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> down

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to the head also does move up and down

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
to the head also does move up and down
just<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> head<00:01:55.050> partner<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.619> actually

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
just the head partner is actually

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.710 
just the head partner is actually
another<00:01:56.250> piece<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> articulation<00:01:57.330> right<00:01:57.479> here

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
another piece of articulation right here

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.729 
another piece of articulation right here
which<00:01:57.869> allows<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.440> up<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> down<00:02:00.739> the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
which allows it to go up and down the

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.589 
which allows it to go up and down the
jaw<00:02:02.310> does<00:02:02.610> move<00:02:02.910> up<00:02:03.179> and<00:02:03.569> down<00:02:04.009> very<00:02:05.009> cool

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
jaw does move up and down very cool

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.479 
jaw does move up and down very cool
his<00:02:07.140> name's<00:02:07.440> Cringer<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> actually<00:02:08.160> call

messing<00:02:29.030> around<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.420> figure<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.900> much<00:02:30.080> or

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
messing around this figure that much or

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.759 
messing around this figure that much or
I'd<00:02:30.380> be<00:02:30.410> best<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.690> head<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> does<00:02:33.319> move<00:02:33.530> up

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
I'd be best be as head and does move up

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.680 
I'd be best be as head and does move up
and<00:02:33.980> down<00:02:34.190> on<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.700> pivot<00:02:35.120> right<00:02:35.269> here<00:02:35.510> which

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and down on this pivot right here which

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.479 
and down on this pivot right here which
they<00:02:35.870> hit<00:02:36.080> pretty<00:02:36.319> well<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:37.160> can<00:02:37.340> actually

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
they hit pretty well you can actually

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.750 
they hit pretty well you can actually
see<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.880> down<00:02:38.030> here<00:02:38.090> though<00:02:39.459> his<00:02:40.459> legs

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
see it down here though his legs

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.050 
see it down here though his legs
actually<00:02:41.360> do<00:02:41.630> move<00:02:42.110> out<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.340> well<00:02:43.849> as

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
actually do move out and in as well as

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.630 
actually do move out and in as well as
forward<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.569> back<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.920> piece<00:02:46.220> I

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
forward and back they have that piece I

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.270 
forward and back they have that piece I
guess<00:02:46.959> right<00:02:47.959> there<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.500> don't<00:02:48.680> know<00:02:49.040> how<00:02:49.220> I

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
guess right there I don't know how I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.140 
guess right there I don't know how I
would<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:50.360> qualify<00:02:50.840> for<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.410> cat<00:02:51.940> moves<00:02:52.940> right

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
would that qualify for a cat moves right

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.080 
would that qualify for a cat moves right
there<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> 360-degree<00:02:54.830> turn<00:02:55.100> for

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
there and can do a 360-degree turn for

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.449 
there and can do a 360-degree turn for
the<00:02:56.209> feet<00:02:56.480> they<00:02:57.049> can<00:02:57.200> actually<00:02:57.350> do<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> 360

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
the feet they can actually do a 360

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.800 
the feet they can actually do a 360
degree<00:02:58.940> turn<00:02:58.970> as<00:02:59.360> well<00:02:59.569> and<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.519> also<00:03:01.810> move

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
degree turn as well and it can also move

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.740 
degree turn as well and it can also move
forward<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.830> back<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.180> see<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.420> detail

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
forward and back you can see the detail

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.120 
forward and back you can see the detail
on<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> bottom<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.319> pop<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.739> mean<00:03:06.799> that's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
on the bottom of the pop I mean that's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.970 
on the bottom of the pop I mean that's
that's<00:03:07.519> incredible<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.780> really<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.110> then<00:03:09.860> they

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
that's incredible it really is then they

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.380 
that's incredible it really is then they
got<00:03:10.069> my<00:03:10.310> favorite<00:03:10.640> piece<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.849> articulation

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
got my favorite piece of articulation

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.670 
got my favorite piece of articulation
which<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:11.840> middle<00:03:12.110> joint<00:03:12.440> which<00:03:12.650> can

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
which is this middle joint which can

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.229 
which is this middle joint which can
rotate<00:03:13.640> 360<00:03:14.330> degrees<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.640> go<00:03:16.640> up<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:17.060> down

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
rotate 360 degrees and go up and down

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.319 
rotate 360 degrees and go up and down
which<00:03:17.810> gives<00:03:18.049> them<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.230> lot<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> movement<00:03:19.329> very

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
which gives them a lot of movement very

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.400 
which gives them a lot of movement very
very<00:03:20.660> Smurfs<00:03:21.880> we've<00:03:22.880> got<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.239> piece<00:03:23.600> just<00:03:24.230> go

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
very Smurfs we've got this piece just go

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.729 
very Smurfs we've got this piece just go
for<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.920> back<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:26.390> then<00:03:26.810> just<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.230> cat<00:03:27.560> we

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
for the back and then just like a cat we

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.620 
for the back and then just like a cat we
got<00:03:27.920> this<00:03:28.070> his<00:03:28.430> two<00:03:28.609> pieces<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:28.940> articulation

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
got this his two pieces of articulation

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470 
got this his two pieces of articulation
which<00:03:29.750> makes<00:03:29.989> him<00:03:30.140> more<00:03:30.670> believable<00:03:31.670> as<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> cat

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
which makes him more believable as a cat

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.199 
which makes him more believable as a cat
so<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:34.100> thing<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.730> would<00:03:34.880> keep<00:03:35.060> it

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
so that so this thing you would keep it

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.849 
so that so this thing you would keep it
cocked<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:35.989> like<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.709> goes

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
cocked back like that so that goes

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.670 
cocked back like that so that goes
forward<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.459> back<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:39.160> right<00:03:40.160> there<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:40.670> well

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
forward and back and right there as well

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.610 
forward and back and right there as well
and<00:03:42.680> he<00:03:42.829> also<00:03:42.980> has<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.400> feet<00:03:43.700> articulation

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
and he also has that feet articulation

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.860 
and he also has that feet articulation
right<00:03:45.620> there<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:46.910> can't<00:03:47.209> fully<00:03:47.359> extend

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
right there so you can't fully extend

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.420 
right there so you can't fully extend
them<00:03:47.989> if<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.440> want<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:48.739> there's<00:03:49.010> no<00:03:49.100> reason

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
them if you want but there's no reason

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.610 
them if you want but there's no reason
to<00:03:49.549> because<00:03:49.760> he's<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.910> cat<00:03:50.209> then<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.109> tale<00:03:51.410> has

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
to because he's a cat then this tale has

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.069 
to because he's a cat then this tale has
articulation<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.579> goes<00:03:53.239> forward<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.870> back

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
articulation to goes forward and back

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.460 
articulation to goes forward and back
and<00:03:54.440> can<00:03:54.769> rotate<00:03:55.100> 360<00:03:55.700> degrees<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
and can rotate 360 degrees so the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.490 
and can rotate 360 degrees so the
articulation<00:03:58.069> on<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.400> one<00:03:58.579> is<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.819> East<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.900> I

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
articulation on this one is a East I I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.650 
articulation on this one is a East I I
can't<00:04:01.310> believe<00:04:01.549> how<00:04:01.700> how<00:04:01.880> cool<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.239> figures<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
can't believe how how cool is figures I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.970 
can't believe how how cool is figures I
mean<00:04:02.780> look<00:04:02.930> at<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.049> head<00:04:03.350> sculpt<00:04:03.620> man<00:04:03.799> that
