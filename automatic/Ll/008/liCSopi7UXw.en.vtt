wanted to check

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.640 
wanted to check
to<00:02:16.879> pull<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.239> out<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.659> then<00:02:17.780> open<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.200> up<00:02:18.349> and

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
it's kind of hard to talk on if you

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.509 
it's kind of hard to talk on if you
receive<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> call<00:02:21.409> while<00:02:21.799> it's<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:22.280> case

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
what it's like so it just snaps on and

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.409 
what it's like so it just snaps on and
as<00:03:33.019> you<00:03:33.049> can<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:34.639> doesn't<00:03:35.000> add<00:03:35.120> any<00:03:35.329> bulk

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
as you can see it doesn't add any bulk

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.250 
as you can see it doesn't add any bulk
to<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> iPhone<00:03:36.439> the<00:03:36.919> chrome<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.579> actually

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
to the iPhone the chrome is actually

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.099 
to the iPhone the chrome is actually
still<00:03:39.260> exposed<00:03:39.699> so<00:03:40.699> that's<00:03:41.479> one<00:03:41.840> thing<00:03:42.049> that

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
still exposed so that's one thing that

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.039 
still exposed so that's one thing that
could<00:03:42.470> get<00:03:42.739> scratched<00:03:43.099> like<00:03:43.519> mine<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:44.120> right

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
could get scratched like mine is right

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.319 
could get scratched like mine is right
now<00:03:45.199> on<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.009> bottom<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.430> chrome<00:03:46.699> is<00:03:46.849> exposed

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
now on the bottom the chrome is exposed

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.869 
now on the bottom the chrome is exposed
as<00:03:47.659> well<00:03:48.049> as<00:03:48.199> the<00:03:48.319> bottom<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:49.040> iPhone<00:03:49.189> and

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
as well as the bottom of the iPhone and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.990 
as well as the bottom of the iPhone and
at<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.599> top<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.109> not<00:03:51.199> really<00:03:51.560> exposed<00:03:52.000> but

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
at the top it's not really exposed but

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.599 
at the top it's not really exposed but
around<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.659> sides<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.439> chrome<00:03:54.769> can<00:03:55.400> get

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
around the sides the chrome can get

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.710 
around the sides the chrome can get
scratched<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:57.139> that's<00:03:57.319> why<00:03:57.949> it's<00:03:58.189> number<00:03:58.489> two

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
scratched so that's why it's number two

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.490 
scratched so that's why it's number two
mostly<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.959> because<00:04:00.889> there's<00:04:01.099> no<00:04:01.220> lip<00:04:01.519> over

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
mostly and because there's no lip over

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.749 
mostly and because there's no lip over
the<00:04:03.500> screen<00:04:03.829> if<00:04:04.099> I<00:04:04.519> if<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:05.000> drop<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:06.759> just

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:07.759 
the screen if I if you drop that just

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.539 
the screen if I if you drop that just
like<00:04:08.359> that<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.739> falls<00:04:09.949> on<00:04:10.069> your<00:04:10.220> pocket

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
like that if it falls on your pocket

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.280 
like that if it falls on your pocket
onto<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:10.939> glass<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.389> glass<00:04:11.599> will<00:04:11.870> shattered

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
onto the glass the glass will shattered

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.080 
onto the glass the glass will shattered

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you what it is so you probably know

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.670 
you what it is so you probably know
because<00:04:53.820> I've<00:04:54.539> made<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.780> couple<00:04:55.020> videos<00:04:55.110> on<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
because I've made a couple videos on it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.930 
because I've made a couple videos on it
now<00:04:55.830> but<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.669> is<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.710> incase<00:04:58.710> slider<00:04:59.130> from<00:04:59.759> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
now but it is the incase slider from the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.350 
now but it is the incase slider from the
fluoro<00:05:00.210> series<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:01.440> have<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.310> green<00:05:03.030> one<00:05:03.180> right

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
fluoro series I have the green one right

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.590 
fluoro series I have the green one right
there<00:05:03.600> but<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.410> one<00:05:04.530> I've<00:05:04.680> been<00:05:04.800> using<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:06.389> the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
there but the one I've been using is the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.960 
there but the one I've been using is the
yellow<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:08.190> just<00:05:08.280> gonna<00:05:08.370> put<00:05:08.669> this<00:05:08.760> back

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
yellow so I'm just gonna put this back

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.550 
yellow so I'm just gonna put this back
on<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.449> tell<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.720> little<00:05:09.750> bit<00:05:09.960> about<00:05:10.199> it<00:05:10.380> so

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
on and tell you a little bit about it so

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.000 
on and tell you a little bit about it so
it<00:05:11.370> just<00:05:11.400> slides<00:05:11.669> right<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.770> then<00:05:13.770> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
it just slides right in and then the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.180 
it just slides right in and then the
bottom<00:05:14.340> piece<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:16.470> just<00:05:16.710> slide<00:05:16.919> that<00:05:17.070> on<00:05:17.130> and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
bottom piece you just slide that on and

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.740 
bottom piece you just slide that on and
I'll<00:05:20.190> just<00:05:20.430> smooth<00:05:20.639> this<00:05:20.820> out<00:05:21.030> of<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.210> way

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.180 

what<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:24.780> really<00:05:25.169> like<00:05:25.440> about<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.889> encase

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
what I really like about the encase

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.659 
what I really like about the encase
slider<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.759> that<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:28.320> protects<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.370> chrome

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
slider is that it it protects the chrome

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.379 
slider is that it it protects the chrome
there's<00:05:30.240> no<00:05:30.900> chrome<00:05:31.229> showing<00:05:31.889> it<00:05:32.010> all<00:05:32.389> goes

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
there's no chrome showing it all goes

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.330 
there's no chrome showing it all goes
completely<00:05:33.660> over<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.169> chrome<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.740> it

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
completely over the chrome and it

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.710 
completely over the chrome and it
slipped<00:05:35.639> up<00:05:35.849> just<00:05:36.419> enough<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:39.060> it<00:05:39.419> fell

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
slipped up just enough that if it fell

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.930 
slipped up just enough that if it fell
right<00:05:39.750> on<00:05:40.199> the<00:05:40.289> screen<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:41.250> would<00:05:41.490> probably

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
right on the screen it would probably

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.480 
right on the screen it would probably
break<00:05:42.210> but<00:05:42.750> there's<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:43.020> less<00:05:43.889> chance<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.340> it

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
break but there's a less chance that it

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.330 
break but there's a less chance that it
would<00:05:44.669> so<00:05:45.659> that's<00:05:46.320> why<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.650> really<00:05:47.099> like<00:05:47.250> this

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
would so that's why I really like this

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.860 
would so that's why I really like this
case<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.789> love<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.060> colors<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.389> are<00:05:48.630> in<00:05:48.659> the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
case I love the colors that are in the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.490 
case I love the colors that are in the
fluoro<00:05:49.110> series<00:05:50.300> it<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.780> looks<00:05:52.080> good<00:05:52.289> all

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
fluoro series it just it looks good all

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.430 
fluoro series it just it looks good all

the buttons they're accessible

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.290 
the buttons they're accessible

I only take it off to clean it and

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.520 
I only take it off to clean it and
that's<00:06:12.030> about<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:12.300> it's<00:06:12.599> always<00:06:12.810> on<00:06:13.050> my<00:06:13.199> iPhone

that's about it it's always on my iPhone
so<00:06:14.039> as<00:06:14.190> of<00:06:14.340> right<00:06:14.370> now<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:15.270> in<00:06:15.419> case<00:06:15.630> slider<00:06:15.930> is

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
so as of right now the in case slider is

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.629 
so as of right now the in case slider is
my<00:06:16.620> number<00:06:16.889> one<00:06:18.770> case<00:06:19.770> for<00:06:19.949> my<00:06:20.070> iPhone<00:06:20.190> I<00:06:20.400> guess

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
my number one case for my iPhone I guess

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.810 
my number one case for my iPhone I guess
you<00:06:21.630> don't<00:06:21.780> got<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:21.990> go<00:06:22.110> with<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:23.490> fluoro

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
you don't got to go with the fluoro

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.879 
you don't got to go with the fluoro
series<00:06:24.180> there's<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.419> lot<00:06:24.720> of<00:06:24.840> other<00:06:24.960> different

types and colors but definitely go with

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.770
