of<00:00:52.980> horsepower<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:55.039> lots<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.579> thing<00:00:56.789> will

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of horsepower it lots this thing will

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
of horsepower it lots this thing will
take<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> horsepower<00:00:57.809> exactly<00:00:58.710> how

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
take a lot of horsepower exactly how

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.569 
take a lot of horsepower exactly how
much<00:01:00.230> horsepower<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> no<00:01:02.340> certain

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
much horsepower there is no certain

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
much horsepower there is no certain
horsepower<00:01:02.940> number<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> when<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> reach<00:01:03.840> at

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
horsepower number that when to reach at

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
horsepower number that when to reach at
the<00:01:04.049> crankshaft<00:01:04.350> will<00:01:04.650> brake<00:01:04.830> crankshaft

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the crankshaft will brake crankshaft
