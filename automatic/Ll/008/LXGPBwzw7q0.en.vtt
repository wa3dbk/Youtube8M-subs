00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.690
 elimination america america many 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.690
 years 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.140
 for the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 holidays 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 I exaggerate today to defend with two goals 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 I could not tell you what you tried to do 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 what the last party did 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.050
 the time always equal along the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.220
 tournament the opponent also 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 he told a lot and unfortunately who 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.370
 has more responsibility in elimination 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.370
 the players because technicians 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.060
 to pass but well that's the way things are 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.970
 they feel football in the end not the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 reached and well now let's see what 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 tells us tomorrow to perform in the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 selection and now think about the selection 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 follow and that is fine now full 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.050
 there unfortunately today with this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.729
 we fulfilled the goal we wanted but 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.710
 well that's how it takes you like this is the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.810
 football and now to think about that that to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.270
 Julian the Americanist hobby 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.790
 good to be calm that we gave it 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.310
 everything on the court this will have to 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 learn from this that maybe we give away 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.570
 a little bit the first time until we 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.890
 they made the goal was that we reacted 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.740
 but there will be that as I tell you to know 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.010
 and get the best out of this with everything to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.010
 hundred 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.200
 well we did not come with that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.420
 intention I believe that the same rival of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 this oil back they are the ones 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 they had the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 so wanting to attack and that's the same 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.780
 He took us back, too 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.880
 we wanted that we could not in the first 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 time and when it was too late 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.980
 with what maybe several did not act 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.190
 things and that in the end we were left out 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 of the line but good 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 calm if what changes is good 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 play which we are on that list and 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.209
 will have to face 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.409
 a great challenge a great responsibility 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.409
 present to your country 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.640
 but a procedural portal error if 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.290
 we will have to support him now that you are 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.150
 with him and good to wait for what comes 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.050
 we are aware of that of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.050
 that anything can happen 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.530
 the first time 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.530
 we give it away later 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.090
 sometimes you do not know things with plans 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 We did not give it away for a while and that's why I asked 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.260
 with eliminatory biblical name 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.740
 when we modify partner by departing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.740
 functions 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.570
 we end up losing the series between 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.570
 balls 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.580
 we tried 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.549
 as assimilated 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.340
 schedule the preseason and disarm 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.740
 this situation 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.160
 of sadness 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.120
 in return guilty I am me 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.120
 the consequence 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.439
 a joke 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.139
 because we are very excited about being able to 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:32.979
 pass but well this is a game already 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.610
 Sometimes it exceeds you in this case we leave you 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.610
 to do a lot of things 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.050
 the second time in question difference 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.580
 usually 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.580
 balance sheet national accounts 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.010
 ace 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.540
 irregular tournament 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.540
 one from the past 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:11.089
 but more than that 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.210
 he is a veteran 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:31.449
 always when I do the support 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:34.910
 we have why not 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.290
 the whole face in times 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.290
 do not put the marker 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.630
 yes 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.640
 do not 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.040
 when in fact 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.890
 so it happens to us like I told you an oil 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.900
 a coin to the air for the past 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.419
 living 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.700
 the last game in a way that stops 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:17.900
 fortune 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.900
 so I 'm passing the animals 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.790
 of positions 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.840
 I think it 's a moment to talk about your 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.240
 life has to follow 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.979
 more important what happened today 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.979
 we are at a time that we are not 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.979
 crazy 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.610
 to 0 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.929
 I think that 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.929
 we did not have the ability to pass 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.440
 all all ended in this case it 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.440
 finished 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:14.130
 has tripled I can accompany with 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.920
 these goddesses season preparations 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.729
 for those of lice you are according to 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.440
 you want to stay American 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.330
 Y 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.669
 demanding their loves 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.320
 then much desire to stain is a 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:39.680
 preseason for a team 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:45.060
 the program 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:50.120
 but they spent working 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:54.280
 20 as a reporter but today 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.280
 and a lot 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.130
 we let ourselves do other things 

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.130
 as much better
