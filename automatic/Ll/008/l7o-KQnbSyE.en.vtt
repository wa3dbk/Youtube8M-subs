you're going to want to stay away from
that<00:01:08.830> I'll<00:01:09.220> explain<00:01:09.550> why<00:01:09.789> later<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.590> let's<00:01:11.740> go

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that I'll explain why later so let's go

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.770 
that I'll explain why later so let's go
ahead<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.160> pick<00:01:12.399> up<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.610> VR<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.179> go<00:01:13.570> straight

over<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.259> other<00:01:14.380> day

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
over to the other day

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.039 
over to the other day
just<00:01:16.040> jump<00:01:16.250> over<00:01:16.400> this<00:01:16.640> gap<00:01:16.909> walk<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> little

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
just jump over this gap walk a little

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.160 
just jump over this gap walk a little
farther<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:19.490> you're<00:01:19.670> there<00:01:19.850> now<00:01:20.170> this

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
farther and then you're there now this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.690 
farther and then you're there now this
base<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:21.440> said<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.860> exactly<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.340> same<00:01:22.430> that

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
base is said it exactly the same that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.430 
base is said it exactly the same that
the<00:01:22.820> other<00:01:22.970> one

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
the other one

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.010 
the other one
I<00:01:23.470> really<00:01:23.710> don't<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.160> explain<00:01:24.340> too<00:01:24.670> much

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I really don't have to explain too much

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.300 
I really don't have to explain too much
like<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> other<00:01:26.290> one<00:01:26.500> as<00:01:26.620> well<00:01:26.740> there's<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.130> big

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
like the other one as well there's a big

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.160 
like the other one as well there's a big
hole<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.790> middle<00:01:27.910> plane<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.960> later

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
hole in the middle plane that later

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.650 
hole in the middle plane that later
don't<00:01:29.500> worry<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.000> map<00:01:31.240> may<00:01:31.420> seem<00:01:31.630> a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
don't worry now this map may seem a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.570 
don't worry now this map may seem a
little<00:01:31.810> small<00:01:32.200> but<00:01:32.620> it's<00:01:33.100> actually<00:01:33.250> worked

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
little small but it's actually worked

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.190 
little small but it's actually worked
out<00:01:33.790> quite<00:01:34.030> well<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.690> think<00:01:34.720> you'll<00:01:35.050> see

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
out quite well and I think you'll see

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.500 
out quite well and I think you'll see
why<00:01:35.380> let's<00:01:36.250> go<00:01:36.460> ahead<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.850> take<00:01:36.970> an<00:01:37.120> alternate

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
why let's go ahead and take an alternate

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.780 
why let's go ahead and take an alternate
route<00:01:37.660> and<00:01:38.020> those<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:38.950> go<00:01:39.100> down<00:01:39.280> these<00:01:39.460> stairs

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
route and those you go down these stairs

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
route and those you go down these stairs
and<00:01:40.090> there's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.300> regenerator<00:01:40.870> right<00:01:41.110> there

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and there's a regenerator right there

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.950 
and there's a regenerator right there
well<00:01:42.400> let's<00:01:42.550> keep<00:01:42.730> going<00:01:42.940> pick<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.660> up<00:01:43.690> for

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
well let's keep going pick that up for

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.100 
well let's keep going pick that up for
now<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.760> before<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:45.910> go<00:01:46.000> any<00:01:46.120> farther<00:01:46.420> notice

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
now and before we go any farther notice

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.750 
now and before we go any farther notice
there's<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> little<00:01:47.500> hidden<00:01:48.040> room<00:01:48.370> under<00:01:48.730> the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
there's a little hidden room under the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.910 
there's a little hidden room under the
base<00:01:49.030> behind<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.690> stairs<00:01:49.990> which<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.770> where

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
base behind the stairs which is where

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.560 
base behind the stairs which is where
the<00:01:51.010> over<00:01:51.280> shield<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.970> maullers<00:01:52.330> fall

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
the over shield and the maullers fall
