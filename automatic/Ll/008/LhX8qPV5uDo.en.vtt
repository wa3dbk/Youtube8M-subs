looping<00:00:06.509> animation<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> simple<00:00:07.710> way<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.639> I

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
looping animation in the simple way so I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.540 
looping animation in the simple way so I
already<00:00:09.900> have<00:00:10.080> an<00:00:10.170> animation<00:00:10.500> setup<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
already have an animation setup in the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.089 
already have an animation setup in the
timeline<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.480> which<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.650> he<00:00:13.889> had

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
timeline right here which is what he had

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.790 
timeline right here which is what he had
said<00:00:14.599> but<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> went<00:00:15.870> ahead<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.109> did<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.770> just

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
said but I went ahead and did is I just

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.220 
said but I went ahead and did is I just
created<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:18.000> used<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.720> brush<00:00:18.960> tool

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
created I just used the brush tool

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.279 
created I just used the brush tool
create<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> circle<00:00:20.720> converted<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.990> movie

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
create a circle converted it to a movie

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.439 
create a circle converted it to a movie
clip<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.880> via<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> f8<00:00:25.080> key<00:00:25.310> or

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
clip you can do that via the f8 key or

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.209 
clip you can do that via the f8 key or
modify<00:00:27.449> convert<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> symbol<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:30.769> named<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
modify convert to symbol and I named the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.620 
modify convert to symbol and I named the
instance<00:00:32.669> name<00:00:33.140> circle<00:00:34.140> underscore<00:00:34.710> MC<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
instance name circle underscore MC and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.209 
instance name circle underscore MC and
then<00:00:37.100> created<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> keyframe<00:00:38.489> down<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:40.219> moved

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
then created a keyframe down here moved

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
then created a keyframe down here moved
it<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.090> here's<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.450> animation<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.980> last

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it so here's my animation on the last

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
it so here's my animation on the last
frame<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> animation<00:00:44.899> added

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
frame of the animation added

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.380 
frame of the animation added
ActionScript<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.870> instance<00:00:49.469> name

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
ActionScript which is the instance name

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
ActionScript which is the instance name
circle<00:00:51.390> underscore<00:00:52.020> MC<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.890> showed

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
circle underscore MC which I just showed

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.290 
circle underscore MC which I just showed
you<00:00:53.129> dot<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> play<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:56.180> what<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you dot go to and play one what this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
you dot go to and play one what this
does<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> tells<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> once<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> gets<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
does is it tells it once it gets to the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.029 
does is it tells it once it gets to the
end<00:00:59.039> go<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> play<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
end go to and play one so go to the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.640 
end go to and play one so go to the
beginning<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.300> over<00:01:03.570> again

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
beginning and play it all over again

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
beginning and play it all over again
I'll<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> continuously<00:01:05.420> over<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> over

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'll do this continuously over and over

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
I'll do this continuously over and over
and<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.770> over<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.600> test<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:11.180> new

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and over and over so to test this new

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.520 
and over and over so to test this new
new<00:01:12.330> web<00:01:12.540> page<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:12.930> flash<00:01:13.320> will

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
new web page because flash will

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730 
new web page because flash will
automatically<00:01:14.130> loop<00:01:14.820> animation<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
automatically loop animation for you so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.219 
automatically loop animation for you so
if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:20.900> file<00:01:22.189> publish<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.229> then

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
if you just go to file publish and then

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
if you just go to file publish and then
or<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> should<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.689> able

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
or you can and then you should be able

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.010 
or you can and then you should be able
to<00:01:27.990> publish<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.520> HTML<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.329> flash<00:01:30.360> that's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to publish it to HTML and flash that's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
to publish it to HTML and flash that's
the<00:01:31.200> default<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.950> default<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> whatever

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the default it will default to whatever

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
the default it will default to whatever
file<00:01:32.970> directory<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> saved<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
file directory that you saved it to I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
file directory that you saved it to I
say<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> looping<00:01:35.880> animation<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.450> my

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
say this is looping animation on my

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
say this is looping animation on my
desktop<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.759> here<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:40.610> C<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
desktop and here is the C this is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.780 
desktop and here is the C this is
playing<00:01:42.689> off<00:01:43.070> HTML<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:46.140> looping<00:01:46.790> this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
playing off HTML and it's looping this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.310 
playing off HTML and it's looping this
is<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> loop<00:01:49.170> an

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
is all you really have to do to loop an

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
is all you really have to do to loop an
animation<00:01:49.680> through<00:01:50.040> ActionScript<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.790> you're

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
animation through ActionScript if you're

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
animation through ActionScript if you're
using<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.729> timeline<00:01:54.380> have<00:01:55.380> any<00:01:55.560> more

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
using the timeline have any more
