00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 very good people how is it good that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.329
 is again with another game of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 modern warfare 3 and good then in this 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.129
 case stretches 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 and like in the last video that going up 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.860
 speaks says with the storms of assault this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.420
 I 'm going to do it with the run of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.850
 specialist and good we are in europe 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.090
 of the bootleg 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.739
 and I'm using your assault rifle 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 145 Fall camouflage because I 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.940
 I was taking it out of gold using the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 recoil competition and the accessory 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.780
 of silencer obviously with gusts 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.190
 of specialist 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 and taking my advantages as always 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 the main benefit the second 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 obviously hard line and the third 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 tip already stable leading the streak of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 specialist who always takes it to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.400
 valet carrying scavenger unsheathed 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 fast and deadly and good silence 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 you have fixed on this man that I finish 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.450
 of killing is worth this character beats in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 a conflict of interest with him during 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 the whole game is worth it will help me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 a lot to take my love and here we go to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
 see several examples of what should not be 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.369
 do and how to teach you how to play in various 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.929
 themes good for you to be fixed a lot 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 people usually do as soon as they see one 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.610
 begins to shoot starts to shoot and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 you already know that the subject of connections 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.649
 it shows a lot in this in this game 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 at least give him the new c3 it shows 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.909
 more than we moved pigs obviously if you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.860
 if you have 50 mb, you are going to beat him up 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 to a person who has 6 megabytes if not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.190
 that knows how to play very well then you 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.230
 you have fixed in 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.690
 I already had all the clear disadvantage in that 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.490
 moment if I started shooting 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.880
 as I have done here that I have done it very 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.050
 wrong the first time I've done it as 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.640
 it has been fixed I have done it well 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.920
 because if I get shot he came to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.270
 give several marker hits and it did not reach 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.430
 kill is worth it obviously he would have advantage 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.050
 about me because he would already know that I was going 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.240
 to go for him and he would be crouching 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.950
 they hid some good part that I am 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.750
 fixed bad luck also that is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 shooting my partner and I put myself in 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.640
 half of the bullets like a fool the ass 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.620
 but good 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 then then you have noticed that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.360
 I made that mistake it start 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.830
 shoot one who was watching and did not 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.630
 they have killed worth what you have to do 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.790
 many times it is to be safe at the time 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.920
 to be able to shoot I think it's a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.990
 very recommendable way if not 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.090
 you want them to kill you so much 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.340
 you have to do is pretty much 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.570
 assure you the death let's go that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 you want to kill him 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.410
 fixed and good here my friend again 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.690
 is there again when the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.850
 sniper and me how it caught me 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.370
 your championship site is worth good here with 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.590
 the boys also me how I learned 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.530
 your champion site 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.190
 you know that sometimes when you can 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.430
 departures there are there every time there are 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.230
 more people who do they are engaged in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.739
 hunch the games more than anything 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.599
 being in places already covered or already 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.020
 be outdoors but camped in the 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.420
 corner 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.850
 with which in this case I already have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.430
 seen that I have learned exactly 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.530
 where is the position of that camper 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.220
 you are going to see it several times you go to 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.110
 see that he will die many times and to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.870
 final is going to end up coming out of the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.890
 game then at the time of playing 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.600
 against camperos unless it 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.240
 an open site does not need to 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.550
 Throw no grenades of them 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.860
 shocked or anything like that when 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.300
 You see that he is a champion or if he has a 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.700
 corner put inside some building 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.700
 obviously if you need to throw 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.330
 the shocked was good here you know 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.849
 fixed prestige prestige 6 other 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.099
 time the same guy who was camped there 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.580
 already in the same place that was already 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.020
 stalking and good you have asked and sf 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.520
 4 how do not they explode they do not have the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.069
 hand of the good dead just when 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.770
 what stretched good here another point that 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.120
 dodged the rocket launcher when you have 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.030
 fixed that he did not take his hand to the dead 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.639
 but I wanted to make a kind of 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.840
 surprise has the c4 and make it explode 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.540
 while he was in second 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.050
 opportunity that I obviously hate 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.880
 very much that advantage and still so although 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.040
 had the hand of death and exploits 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.220
 forward my noses would not kill me 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.530
 since the only way to dodge that 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.500
 that disgusting advantage is obviously 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.320
 wearing protective shield 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.910
 and another thing as I go 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.449
 making gameplays and I can think of more 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.340
 ideas against the campers for 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.560
 and be able to annoy the campers because 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.720
 more than anything 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.700
 more and more people tend to be 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.980
 dedicate to campear and this is not a 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.230
 came from series already came from before 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.550
 that came bad series then every 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.440
 time I can think of an idea for 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.419
 help with these issues I'm going to do 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.550
 good same uncle same site of champion 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.020
 with her c4 on the floor and that she 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.840
 I imagined I'm going to go through there 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.570
 because thanks to him he will kill me 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.190
 it's free ok and good right now I think 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.330
 remember that one of the fashions was not 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.980
 I know how many times he will have died 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.290
 prestige 6 but right now just 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.479
 when I'm going to throw it you're going to see down to 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.430
 the left as that person leaves 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.680
 the match 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.820
 so good as I was saying every 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.090
 once I came up with some idea of 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.860
 how to dodge the campers how 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.820
 burst without them surprising you 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.670
 you 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.320
 I'm going to try the tips 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.010
 although they follow that is a good advice 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.270
 catch is the rpg and put it where you 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.880
 fit and you see less than a fish 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.200
 obviously obviously good then you see 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.150
 you have fixed it had already disappeared 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.280
 the prestige if I continued with care 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.600
 here and good because the game does not 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.340
 there is a lot and good there is a person who 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.750
 he asks me how do I always do the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.060
 last death the truth is that I do not know 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.770
 and all I do is dedicate to 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.470
 kill and well I have the luck of 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.870
 that I always almost always do the 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.360
 final death chamber so good 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.280
 I hope it was served that you vote 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.050
 that you comment and subscribe and I hope that you 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.430
 have liked we are so good we 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.580
 we go to the next chao and until the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.580
 next
