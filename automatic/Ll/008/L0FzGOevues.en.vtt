performing<00:00:59.059> live<00:00:59.390> because<00:00:59.540> normally<00:00:59.930> we'd<00:01:00.079> be

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
performing live because normally we'd be

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.750 
performing live because normally we'd be

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.270 
as I mentioned earlier on the cassiopi
x3<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.420> now<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.930> four<00:02:12.230> individual<00:02:12.920> certain

such as a computer or MIDI module so
that<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.750> use<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:24.230> turn<00:02:24.560> from<00:02:24.800> an<00:02:25.160> external

that we can use a turn from an external
device<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.780> we<00:02:26.870> want<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.170> we<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.320> layer

device and if we want to we can layer

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.110 
device and if we want to we can layer
that<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.160> internal<00:02:28.640> sounds<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.060> the
