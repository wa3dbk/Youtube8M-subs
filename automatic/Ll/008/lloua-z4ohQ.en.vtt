going<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:08.189> designs<00:00:08.580> one<00:00:09.330> with

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
going to make two designs one with

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140 
going to make two designs one with
custom<00:00:10.110> scenery<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:11.250> month<00:00:11.460> out<00:00:11.610> custom

custom scenery and one month out custom

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690 
custom scenery and one month out custom
scenery<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> start<00:00:14.340> off<00:00:14.639> with

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
scenery so I'm going to start off with

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.120 
scenery so I'm going to start off with
the<00:00:14.910> station<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.570> no<00:00:15.809> custom<00:00:16.260> scene<00:00:16.470> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the station with no custom scene so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
the station with no custom scene so
everyone<00:00:17.550> could<00:00:17.789> probably<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:20.270> okay<00:00:21.270> so

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
everyone could probably do this okay so

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830 
everyone could probably do this okay so

the full coaster just build the station
I<00:00:35.280> usually<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.930> blocks<00:00:36.960> high<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:39.950> 55

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
I usually do it two blocks high and 55

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.060 
I usually do it two blocks high and 55
15<00:00:42.420> blocks<00:00:42.690> long<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> once<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.070> build

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
far so then you scroll up until you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.380 
far so then you scroll up until you
reach<00:01:41.420> what<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.370> fern<00:01:44.370> height<00:01:44.880> slate

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
slate half rooftop and then you're going

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.830 
slate half rooftop and then you're going
to<00:03:29.370> build<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:32.330> then<00:03:33.330> spin<00:03:33.720> it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to build it like this then spin it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.430 
to build it like this then spin it
around<00:03:33.959> half<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.180> then<00:03:36.180> build<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.690> exactly

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
around half and then build it exactly

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.500 
around half and then build it exactly
how<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.830> did<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.670> other<00:03:39.510> side<00:03:43.819> just<00:03:44.819> like

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
how you did on the other side just like

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.710 
how you did on the other side just like
this<00:03:45.900> that's<00:03:46.620> what<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.920> should<00:03:46.950> look<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.720> now

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
this that's what it should look like now

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.070 
this that's what it should look like now
there's<00:03:49.080> one<00:03:49.320> more<00:03:49.380> step<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> making<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.330> no

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
there's one more step and making this no
