00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.570

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.769
 someone's on the bottom is very good 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.430

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:31.700
 this is my back seam 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.459
 date its seam is almost invisible here we are 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.709

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:41.860

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.470
 visor it will be completely athletic 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.390
 great boy cap 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.349
 but so wonderful hat 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.330
 it turns out time to make hats 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:59.149
 together with the record it took me about 3 hours 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.890
 if you do not record and do not like this 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.039
 here diligently showed each 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
 movement as I did, I do not show 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.810
 all calculations drawings 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.720
 and and everything else I would sit down and make me 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.739
 it would take a little more than an hour to do it all 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.690
 such a cap, that is, I am on such a cap 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.870
 wonderful spend 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.330
 no more than an hour because this drawing 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.750
 it is not necessary to choose completely 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.549
 any other diamond pattern and are shown 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.970
 for example how to combine diamonds and 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.650
 wedges because if done differently 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.010
 it will be ugly i showed how 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.620
 you can combine the drawing with the wings 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.959
 it could be done differently 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.260
 big wedge not even glue on some 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.030
 different pattern and big glue because 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.060
 I think this design aesthetics 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.860
 on the most important thing is necessary so that was all 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.660
 closed that everything was neat and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.900
 Like this can this not striking 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.360
 but this is done carefully to me not 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.989
 ashamed of such a product my child 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.680

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.690
 kills when the hat seems to be done 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.389
