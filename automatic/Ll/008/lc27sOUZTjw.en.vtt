00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
I have with them and you know the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.750 
I have with them and you know the
biggest<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.930> guess<00:02:35.140> would<00:02:35.319> be<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.830> he<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
biggest I guess would be that he is a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.970 
biggest I guess would be that he is a
little<00:02:37.480> bit<00:02:37.720> more<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.080> pretty<00:02:38.470> boy<00:02:38.680> side

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
little bit more on the pretty boy side

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.490 
little bit more on the pretty boy side
but<00:02:40.260> he's<00:02:41.260> still<00:02:41.620> he<00:02:42.489> still<00:02:43.110> mature<00:02:44.110> enough<00:02:44.319> he

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
but he's still he still mature enough he

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.570 
but he's still he still mature enough he
still<00:02:44.709> looks<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.130> he's<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.459> be<00:02:45.549> a

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
still looks like he's going to be a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.620 
still looks like he's going to be a
mature<00:02:45.970> Superman<00:02:46.599> he's<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.959> his<00:02:47.200> late<00:02:47.590> 20s<00:02:48.630> and

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
as I'm concerned having said that I'm

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.140 
as I'm concerned having said that I'm
really<00:04:31.170> looking<00:04:31.290> forward<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.580> think

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
really looking forward to this I I think

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.920 
really looking forward to this I I think
that<00:04:33.360> he<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:34.430> good<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.570> said<00:04:36.630> he's<00:04:36.900> a

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
that he is a good like I said he's a

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.310 
that he is a good like I said he's a
good<00:04:37.140> choice<00:04:38.270> I'm<00:04:39.270> surprised<00:04:39.720> by<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.020> choice

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
good choice I'm surprised by the choice

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.430 
good choice I'm surprised by the choice
but<00:04:41.190> I'm<00:04:41.310> excited<00:04:41.670> I'm<00:04:42.600> really<00:04:42.630> looking

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
but I'm excited I'm really looking

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.730 
but I'm excited I'm really looking
forward<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.890> this<00:04:44.960> having<00:04:45.960> said<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.230> I<00:04:46.650> do

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
forward to this having said that I do

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.860 
forward to this having said that I do
feel<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.340> he<00:04:47.580> does<00:04:47.820> need<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.150> bulk<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.690> bit

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
feel that he does need to bulk up a bit

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.530 
feel that he does need to bulk up a bit
he<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.200> bit<00:04:49.500> on<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.830> skinnier<00:04:50.280> side<00:04:50.550> but<00:04:51.240> um

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
he is a bit on the skinnier side but um

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.110 
he is a bit on the skinnier side but um
I<00:04:51.870> think<00:04:52.500> he<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.920> bulk<00:04:53.220> up<00:04:53.460> i<00:04:53.610> think<00:04:53.640> there's

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
I think he can bulk up i think there's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.300 
I think he can bulk up i think there's
ways<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.570> making<00:04:54.900> him<00:04:55.050> look<00:04:55.230> taller<00:04:55.590> since<00:04:56.100> he

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
ways of making him look taller since he

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.310 
ways of making him look taller since he
is<00:04:56.430> 61<00:04:57.110> um<00:04:59.090> but<00:05:00.090> yeah<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.510> think<00:05:00.600> he'll<00:05:00.990> fit<00:05:01.140> the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
is 61 um but yeah I think he'll fit the

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.320 
is 61 um but yeah I think he'll fit the
bill<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.820> know<00:05:03.260> quite<00:05:04.260> nicely<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:06.000> when<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
bill you know quite nicely so when the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.420 
bill you know quite nicely so when the
end<00:05:06.510> we'll<00:05:07.200> just<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.710> wait<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:07.920> see<00:05:08.130> what

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
end we'll just have to wait and see what

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.280 
end we'll just have to wait and see what
happens<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:09.090> hope<00:05:09.360> things<00:05:09.540> work<00:05:09.780> out<00:05:09.930> for<00:05:09.990> the
