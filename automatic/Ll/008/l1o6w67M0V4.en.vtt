location<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.369> him<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.970> only<00:00:30.090> problem<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.539> with

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
location on him the only problem is with

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
location on him the only problem is with
hiding<00:00:31.140> between<00:00:31.380> these<00:00:31.830> trees<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hiding between these trees is that you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
hiding between these trees is that you
never<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> pellet<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
never know when that pellet is then to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so it's a very big risk so I've got a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.270 
so it's a very big risk so I've got a
move<00:00:37.860> on

know<00:02:02.000> at<00:02:02.149> this<00:02:02.270> time<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.229> decided<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.710> take<00:02:03.890> a

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
know at this time so I decided to take a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.590 
know at this time so I decided to take a
little<00:02:04.280> bit<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.580> different<00:02:04.970> route<00:02:05.179> just<00:02:05.479> to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
little bit of a different route just to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.280 
little bit of a different route just to
see<00:02:05.780> what's<00:02:06.080> ahead<00:02:06.229> of<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.619> main<00:02:06.830> force<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.260> I

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
see what's ahead of the main force so I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.930 
see what's ahead of the main force so I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
got a pistol so he's going to be much

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.330
