just here at the podcast video

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:19.130 
just here at the podcast video
exhibition<00:00:08.290> in<00:00:08.830> London<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.230> look<00:00:11.230> at<00:00:11.380> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.390 

here<00:00:20.140> which<00:00:20.260> is<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.500> only<00:00:20.590> one<00:00:20.890> in<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.039> UK

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:01:06.750 

where<00:00:27.400> they<00:00:27.580> have<00:01:04.830> music<00:01:05.830> because<00:01:06.400> when<00:01:06.610> you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
where they have music because when you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.000 
where they have music because when you
external<00:01:07.210> video<00:01:07.360> devices<00:01:07.990> as<00:01:08.110> well<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:08.860> can

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
external video devices as well you can

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.130 
external video devices as well you can
bypass<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.610> memory<00:01:09.939> can<00:01:10.119> need<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.510> bypass<00:01:10.720> the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
bypass a memory can need to bypass the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.740 
bypass a memory can need to bypass the
internal<00:01:11.470> memory<00:01:11.590> completely<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.570> let<00:01:13.689> me

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
internal memory completely but let me

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.330 
internal memory completely but let me
explain<00:01:13.869> it's<00:01:14.260> a<00:01:14.290> video<00:01:14.530> camera<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.070> stills

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
explain it's a video camera and a stills

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.740 
explain it's a video camera and a stills
camera<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.729> we<00:01:15.820> think<00:01:16.299> it's<00:01:16.420> going<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.630> do

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
camera and we think it's going to do

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.350 
camera and we think it's going to do
really<00:01:16.780> well<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.320> both<00:01:17.439> both<00:01:17.830> markets<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
really well in both both markets to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.880 
really well in both both markets to
focus<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:20.020> video<00:01:22.350> any<00:01:23.350> previous<00:01:23.860> generation

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
focus on video any previous generation

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.429 
focus on video any previous generation
camera<00:01:24.759> when<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.420> could<00:01:25.600> argue<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.990> still

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
camera when you could argue that still

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.980 
camera when you could argue that still
better<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:30.270> approach<00:01:31.270> should<00:01:31.479> be<00:01:31.540> able<00:01:31.780> to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
better to approach should be able to

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.649 
better to approach should be able to

observe

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
observe

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.050 
dual-core processor the processing it in
it<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.439> lot<00:01:59.770> quicker<00:02:00.130> than<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
it is a lot quicker than that the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.870 
it is a lot quicker than that the
previous<00:02:01.569> generation<00:02:02.140> cameras<00:02:02.500> also<00:02:03.399> allows

previous generation cameras also allows

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.270 
previous generation cameras also allows

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
for better signal-to-noise ratio so

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.059 
for better signal-to-noise ratio so

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
lowlife perform better better colors as

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.850 
lowlife perform better better colors as
well<00:02:09.299> diabetic<00:02:10.299> relation<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.019> terms<00:02:11.290> of

well diabetic relation in terms of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430 
well diabetic relation in terms of
ranges<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.760> yeah<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.540> mean<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.959> we

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
ranges and so on so yeah I mean this we

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:26.699 
ranges and so on so yeah I mean this we
think<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.799> mean<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.160> his<00:02:15.220> price<00:02:15.549> range<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.530> you

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
think I mean in his price range if you

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.680 
think I mean in his price range if you
if<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.069> shoot<00:02:27.310> directly<00:02:27.760> from<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.120> clean

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
if you shoot directly from the clean

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780 
if you shoot directly from the clean
feed<00:02:28.900> from<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.170> HDMI<00:02:29.650> output<00:02:30.099> then<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.640> can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
feed from the HDMI output then you can

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
feed from the HDMI output then you can
record<00:02:31.030> director<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.630> programs<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.590> you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
record director of programs have you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.550 
record director of programs have you
don't<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.220> any<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.670> they're<00:02:33.880> sort<00:02:34.180> of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
don't so any of that they're sort of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.839 
don't so any of that they're sort of
broadcasting<00:02:36.390> tailored<00:02:37.769> not<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.579> ever

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
broadcasting tailored not well not ever

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.550 
broadcasting tailored not well not ever
there's<00:02:40.090> such<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.690> mean<00:02:40.720> yeah<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.200> could<00:02:41.380> say

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
there's such I mean yeah you could say

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.860 
there's such I mean yeah you could say
that<00:02:41.590> something<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:05:20.040 

to<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.960> camera<00:03:50.670> as<00:03:51.670> well<00:04:51.000> in<00:04:54.750> the<00:05:18.960> fact<00:05:19.960> that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
to the camera as well in the fact that

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.710 
to the camera as well in the fact that
the<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.890> db4<00:05:21.310> has<00:05:21.520> where<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:22.000> can<00:05:22.210> kind<00:05:22.630> of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the the db4 has where you can kind of

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.620 
the the db4 has where you can kind of
what<00:05:23.440> when<00:05:23.620> filming<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.250> can<00:05:24.430> zoom<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.849> for

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
what when filming so you can zoom in for

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.920 
what when filming so you can zoom in for
that<00:05:25.780> throw<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.470> haven't<00:05:26.830> got<00:05:26.950> exactly<00:05:27.930> it's

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
that throw you haven't got exactly it's

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.990 
that throw you haven't got exactly it's
got<00:05:29.169> one<00:05:29.530> point<00:05:29.770> two<00:05:29.890> times<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.640> keep<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.880> little

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
got one point two times to keep a little

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000 
got one point two times to keep a little
bit<00:05:31.090> closer<00:05:31.390> to<00:05:31.599> the<00:05:31.630> action<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:32.590> also<00:05:32.740> got

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
bit closer to the action it's also got

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.100 
bit closer to the action it's also got
the<00:05:33.099> DX<00:05:33.400> which<00:05:33.849> gives<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.300> one<00:05:34.330> point<00:05:34.810> five

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
the DX which gives you one point five

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:45.480 
the DX which gives you one point five
times<00:05:37.890> as<00:05:38.890> well<00:05:41.550> as<00:05:42.550> well<00:05:43.410> directly<00:05:44.410> with<00:05:44.680> 1920

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
times as well as well directly with 1920

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.760 
times as well as well directly with 1920
by<00:05:45.640> 1080<00:05:46.030> pixels<00:05:46.180> which<00:05:47.080> gives<00:05:47.289> you<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.410> picture

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
by 1080 pixels which gives you a picture

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.270 
by 1080 pixels which gives you a picture
perfect<00:05:48.690> rendition<00:05:49.690> of<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.140> video<00:05:50.440> so<00:05:51.130> you're
