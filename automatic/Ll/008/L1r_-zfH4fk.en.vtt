evening<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:18.000> ancient<00:01:18.210> Greece<00:01:19.790> yes<00:01:20.790> penny<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
evening in ancient Greece yes penny I

evening in ancient Greece yes penny I
used<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> bathroom<00:01:22.700> can't<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
used to go to the bathroom can't you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.450 
used to go to the bathroom can't you
hold<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.869> 2,600<00:01:25.619> years<00:01:27.920> now<00:01:28.920> remember

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
hold it not for 2,600 years now remember

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
hold it not for 2,600 years now remember
Newton<00:01:30.030> realized<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.869> Aristotle<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.619> wrong

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.429 
Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong
and<00:01:32.250> force<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:33.119> necessary<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> maintain

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and force was not necessary to maintain

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
and force was not necessary to maintain
motion<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.040> let's<00:01:35.549> plug<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.119> our<00:01:36.299> 9.8<00:01:37.290> m/s^2<00:01:38.250> as

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
motion so let's plug in our 9.8 m/s^2 as

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.090 
motion so let's plug in our 9.8 m/s^2 as
a<00:01:39.590> force<00:01:40.590> earth<00:01:41.130> gravity<00:01:41.610> equals<00:01:42.119> mass<00:01:42.420> times

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
a force earth gravity equals mass times

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
a force earth gravity equals mass times
9.8<00:01:44.100> meters<00:01:44.430> per<00:01:44.460> second<00:01:44.880> per<00:01:45.000> second<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.450> we

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
9.8 meters per second per second so we

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.830 
9.8 meters per second per second so we
can<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.229> ma<00:01:46.649> equals<00:01:47.280> mg<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.720> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
can see that ma equals mg and what do we

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.240 
can see that ma equals mg and what do we
know<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.170> this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.440 

we<00:01:55.150> know<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:56.730> Newton<00:01:57.730> was<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:57.940> really<00:01:58.240> smart

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
we know that Newton was a really smart

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.280 
we know that Newton was a really smart
cookie<00:01:58.840> oh<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.510> where<00:02:01.600> Fig<00:02:01.810> Newtons<00:02:02.080> come

no you just suck at teaching reeling

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
no you just suck at teaching reeling
there's<00:02:34.230> two<00:02:34.410> explanations<00:02:34.710> which<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.550> seems

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
there's two explanations which one seems

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.490 
there's two explanations which one seems
the<00:02:35.940> most<00:02:36.120> likely<00:02:39.110> understand<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.350> you're

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the most likely understand but you're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.780 
the most likely understand but you're
going<00:02:40.800> too<00:02:40.920> fast

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
going too fast

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.480 
going too fast
can<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.210> back<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.290> bit<00:02:43.560> all

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
can you just back up a little bit all

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:53.510
