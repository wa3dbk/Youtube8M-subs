HIKARI-First part, The lightless girl

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.250
When the heart dark is, the eyes nothing can 
 see and the mind nothing can understand

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:29.304
but in this dark heart is the real you

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:33.594
Burn and extinguish just enough so that you don't fall

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.000

00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:54.220
Shadow does not exist. What you call shadow is light that you don't see. 
Henri Barbusse
