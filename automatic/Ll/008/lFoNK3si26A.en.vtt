00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.299
 day day luca hello hello 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.510
 here we are then we do one 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.900
 overview of one of the most cars 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.540
 interesting of skoda house which is fast 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.480
 and houston scola rapid rapt is one 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 sedan three volumes of the moment ok 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
 what can you tell us about the interiors but 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 we are already watching we are already 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 inside the car the version that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.519
 Here we have an active version of the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.130
 let's say from a base with an authorial climate of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.200
 series and command on the steering wheel 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 car radio so you have the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 possibility to raise to adjust the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 volume change stations directly 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 the interior is very similar to the car 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.649
 of the new tavia then resumes the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.629
 octavia line 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.940
 but it's a smaller car and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.039
 size about 20 cm in less respect 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 to the new Italy handy practice 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.660
 spacious both inside and the side 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 passenger side guide which of course for 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.640
 rear passengers is the thing 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 interesting of the car and the price 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.490
 because the petrol 1200 75 horses with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 scrapping 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.770
 we have 10,690 euros plus ipt too 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.400
 provincial registration tax 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 and there is the possibility of making methane 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 on the car then on the 1200 we can 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.390
 mount the system with natural gas and all 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.740
 LPG system without any type of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 problem this is something you can 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.380
 you can order directly from us 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.880
 the car already with natural gas or LPG 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 of course it is always done 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.689

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 home in the car and inside the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 quick as you can see 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.119
 obviously in this version that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.329
 we have therefore available to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:58.350

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.490
 to the CD player and has climate as standard 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.930
 it is manual therefore it inclines with the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.649
 temperature regulation and the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.580
 speed and the indication or then below here

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.380
 what was we notice already in this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.930
 version the machine is already super 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.370

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.110
 possibility to switch on the light i 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.670

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.950
 veron and pastiere the driver of the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.990
 vehicle if the passenger for example 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.540
 read read something during 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.920
 travel are more and more particular but they are 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.959
 important details because you 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.209
 allow you to stay in complete autonomy 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.300
 inside the vehicle without disturbing 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.100
 who who is guide you come to serve 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.470
 see it in the dealer because the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.750
 price is very interesting indeed 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.730
 really listen regarding 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.680
 instead we do what we see 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.950
 here in the dashboard what were you doing 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.250

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.010
 see her succeeded dominated aic tachometer 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.470
 obviously always on all now 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.050
 psyche spies to make them fog in this 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.060
 case on the on -board computers then 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.280
 computer that signals you km in this 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.760
 moment from cars you change with question 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.230
 big button I'm afraid that's how ok it is 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.330
 the temperature indicator already 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.470
 inside the vehicle the level of 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.180
 fuel 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.220
 machine switch-on time i 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.950
 kilometers traveled the average of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.830
 mileage done 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.180
 then with the car consumption to 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.160
 kilometers and in the central part e 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 marches dott with obviously everything 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.200
 electronic so it is analog 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.800
 electronic very important or how 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.660
 security how many bergamo 6 airbags 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.180
 fronts ventilated those of ato 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.430
 passenger side airbag protection 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.959
 so remember that minister of 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.450
 head and also well positioned on the 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.220

 from any intrusions the native land 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.650
 I got it right and then as you said it is worth 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.810
 worth a ride to present it again 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.160
