00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 youtube friends my name is serious and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.110
 this is another consequence of seriousness 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.550
 say that to ogg format on Wednesday night 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.539
 probably and today it's about that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.730
 theme donate yes and indeed that was 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.350
 The topic is actually donating this week 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 relatively big topic and I became one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 really written on in bulk 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 youtube on facebook is mine 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.970
 pin board posted and so on and so on 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 And that's what it's all about 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 attributed to that youtube relative 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 regularly such creator blogs as like 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.200
 lok brings out on youtube itself where 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.969
 you quasi as content creators so so 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 as the youtuber does not create as 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 viewers can actually then look 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 what youtube intends to do in the near future 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 plans to think and so on and so forth 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.059
 from time to time things were just like that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.320
 that in the future you will have your own 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 channel a bit better at 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 can manage smartphone that is namely 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.449
 made quite shitty if you can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.620
 somehow video wants to switch public 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.510
 or something and then it worked 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 of course, as always, the big one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.909
 theme money our beloved topic what 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.320
 actually as good as in the meantime 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.030
 every block I have so the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.170
 impression but really there so much in the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 I thought I had asked night 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 Also say it is quite a suspension 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.009
 meanwhile common and that was earlier 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.799
 Not at all, for example 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.780
 on such streaming portals as 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.210
 twitter or hit box is the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.799
 appropriate streamer or youtuber 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 can send money 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.040
 live at the stream you can tell what 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 Donate There is mostly via paypal 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.189
 or paypal depending on how you like that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.869
 would like to pronounce it and then it will 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.610
 even here below that fades in 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.200
 means then your message then runs 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.020
 picture and arises there has donated 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 euro 23 or mine is also 3000 euro 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 if her scary rich that was still 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.240
 a few years ago i can believe myself 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 I remind that julias block the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.840
 ubiquitous julien that time 2011 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 had made that he did he say 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 People I like to have even better videos 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.180
 I need better things for that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 equipment better microphone i would like 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 travel through the world for you from there 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 Report I need money donate to me 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.840
 what the julien video is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 no longer had that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.420
 at that time still a relatively large one 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 Protective area triggered even before three 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.819
 years 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.020
 that now switched to private 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.020
 you will find a bit like that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.280
 conclusion and feedback videos 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.960
 but I could remember that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.580
 that was spitefully and I had me 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.020
 then even wondered that that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 Recently in a stream at one 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.200
 Befriended youtuber saw that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.430
 the people have always donated something 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.100
 and that people are really partial 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.810
 have donated incredibly 150 euro where 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.040
 I once laughed watts evag who gives 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.290
 because now so much money for it 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 so far because youtube year for you 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.500
 completely free so everything I have 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.300
 earn everything every other youtuber 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.710
 It is easy to earn over the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600
 financed advertising and then I had 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.950
 The other day I really say that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.300
 I had one three weeks ago 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.860
 private message and maybe you are watching 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.430
 you downright thought someone me 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.650
 written 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.270
 he just does not want to watch the advertising 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.620
 had absolutely no bock on it he 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.300
 think it was cool what I do 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.590
 and he would like to support me though 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.090
 there is a possibility admit me 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.430
 support or something for me 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.380
 donate and there is at the time 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 At the time I do not know if it is 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.140
 At some point there will be on there 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.340
 no case and I told him 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.380
 if there wants to buy something about the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.520
 amazon left buy because I deserve 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.690
 always a bit with grant it would be 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.640
 just ok and it would not be him anymore 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 but in fact I was costing myself 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.240
 already addressed whether it is the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.120
 Possibility to do so now I have that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.140
 on other portals read something like that 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.970
 websites have reported gaming 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.010
 magazine reported about it and there 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.580
 what mostly a shitstorm that the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.730
 have said 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.100
 the asylum it player we push 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.020
 not just our money in ashes and such and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.630
 By the way, this gesture brings in everyone 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.630
 video and there was the opinion so 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.459
 relatively negative but I think I have 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.780
 so a bit the impression that if 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.130
 for example a very positive one 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.170
 makes video or a very positive 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.360
 youtuber is very very or very very nice 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.740
 has close community and people want 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080
 waste and it can be like 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.550
 50 cent euro or 2 euro or so 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.630
 I believe that on youtube 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.160
 would work 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.340
 Of course the question is always why 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.770
 youtube does that because youtube is now 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.000
 not somehow a samaritan composite 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.650
 or something like that but of course they want 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.570
 I also make money with it 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.310
 me now so at the moment the question what 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.810
 earn the earning it 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.730
 somehow the fees or comes there 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.800
 but you have to do something else if you 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.930
 two euros donate 20 cents 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.310
 give youtube to google that knows im 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 not yet but it is mostly 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.400
 have been so if the such features so 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.500
 as announced in this creator video 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.150
 have that relatively soon so 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.239
 was built so I would use it 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 Really just still expect that in 2014 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.860
 on youtube itself a tool a feature 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.900
 will come where you have dementia 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.240
 break the channel can send money 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.689
 send me all the money i would like 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.490
 from the bahamas , by the way, send and 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.379
 So that will probably come there 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.360
 Now my question to you is it 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:40.219
 very reprehensible if someone donates 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.349
 asks and what could be the consequences 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:46.520
 that might have it that way 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.960
 that you are an extremely horny exciting 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.740
 let's play looks and suddenly 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.669
 stop stop this let's play goes 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.099
 only further if you together 555 euro 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:05.509
 I have been donating until then 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:06.469
 in the camera I do not know how long 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.569
 there I will take you knows how fast 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.750
 that could be broadcast live 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.310
 But there are very positive aspects 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.990
 But I always have it that way 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.849
 negative picture really says yes to the 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.990
 people if you are not 100 here 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.279
 Donated there is also that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.689
 not the next video though the people 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.479
 would probably go into it anyway 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.979
 In fact, I find it is in the account 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.479
 moment an interesting option 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.039
 it would be easy for me 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.629
 I wonder if that would hack me 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.339
 if i say now hey there is one 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.360
 donationsbutton everyone can donate 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:35.690
 nobody has to donate anything 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.669
 I think it is now for the moment that was for 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.409
 Personally none at all 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.370
 problematic I was extremely surprised 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.789
 that's why so many people like me 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.509
 have written because no one has to 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.639
 what donate 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.529
 nobody has to pay for a canal 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.060
 and everyone can get their money from me too 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.039
 home hoard until it is no longer 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.779
 it's only about the people who like it 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.279
 Anybody would do that 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.419
 Support does not shine at all 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.360
 just me but somehow a good one 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.710
 project good video good youtuber and 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.240
 if we want to do it, we can 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.830
 make and because of full high 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.719
 Subscriber number he can already at 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.279
 small amounts just bigger 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.319
 quantities come together with whom you 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.569
 possibly finance great projects 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.610
 can meet like a huge community 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.560
 or what do I have to donate so yes 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.330
 not just for being in 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.729
 to rest in the future on the bahamas 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.650
 and then report of palms waving 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.330
 but maybe it will happen yes 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.889
 so something really good and 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.389
 you can do something with it and so 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.009
 and that's why I actually think so 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.599
 good that youtube installs that and that 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.370
 not such external services 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.020
 leaves a bit critical you have to 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.610
 Nevertheless I stay above the topic 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.529
 very curious about your opinion you can 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.659
 me now in the 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:41.059
 0 comments post yes that was it on 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.069
 every case for today with the like lok on 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.899
 Wednesday evening if you have more in the future 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.939
 then you should have buck something like that 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.169
 you just have this entire project with you 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.879
 support thumbs up 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.049
 instead of a donation and if you 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.179
 that should not have done long ago 

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:55.099
 you can find one here in this area 

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:57.019
 subscribe -button otherwise linked 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.179
 Of course I still left you right and left 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:06.889
 two others follow from this format and 

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:09.279
 stay with Sirius until then 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.279
 time out
