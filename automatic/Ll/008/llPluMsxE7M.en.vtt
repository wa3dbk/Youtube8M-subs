the description and I would encourage
you<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> check<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.039> discuss<00:02:08.929> because

you to check it out and discuss because
this<00:02:10.410> means<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.100> next<00:02:11.370> season<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.880> next

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this means that the next season and next

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870 
this means that the next season and next
era<00:02:12.360> will<00:02:13.020> focus<00:02:13.320> on<00:02:13.650> XP<00:02:13.980> grinding<00:02:14.370> even<00:02:14.640> more

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
made it group fight and then they

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.890 
made it group fight and then they
removed<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.100> entirely

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
removed it entirely

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.789 
removed it entirely

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.500 
find after the fix and this is exactly
the<00:02:57.530> kind<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.769> gameplay<00:02:58.129> that<00:02:58.510> this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the kind of gameplay that this

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.979 
the kind of gameplay that this
experience<00:03:00.129> change<00:03:01.209> promotes<00:03:02.209> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.750> next

experience change promotes in the next
season<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:05.659> now<00:03:05.870> we're<00:03:06.260> going<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.500> do<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> test

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
season so now we're going to do a test

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.390 
season so now we're going to do a test
we're<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:07.970> kill<00:03:08.150> gum<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:09.680> torment<00:03:10.190> and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
we're going to kill gum on torment and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.710 
we're going to kill gum on torment and
as<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:11.150> Paragon<00:03:11.659> 800<00:03:12.170> barbarian<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.510> then

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
as a Paragon 800 barbarian and then

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.099 
as a Paragon 800 barbarian and then
we're<00:03:14.930> gonna<00:03:15.079> kill<00:03:15.319> him<00:03:15.500> as<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:17.000> Paragon<00:03:17.569> 2,000

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
we're gonna kill him as a Paragon 2,000

00:03:18.109 --> 00:05:03.080 
we're gonna kill him as a Paragon 2,000
barbarian

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.629 

so<00:05:03.690> as<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:03.990> saw<00:05:04.139> from<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.470> test<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:05.040> took<00:05:05.280> 41

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
so as you saw from the test it took 41

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.150 
so as you saw from the test it took 41
seconds<00:05:06.150> for<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.810> Paragon<00:05:07.139> 800<00:05:07.500> barbarian<00:05:08.010> to

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
seconds for the Paragon 800 barbarian to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.909 
seconds for the Paragon 800 barbarian to
kill<00:05:08.310> gum<00:05:08.490> while<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.180> took<00:05:09.360> 26<00:05:09.960> seconds<00:05:10.350> for

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
kill gum while it took 26 seconds for

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.830 
kill gum while it took 26 seconds for
the<00:05:11.010> Paragon<00:05:11.340> 2000<00:05:11.940> barbarian<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.510> kill<00:05:12.660> gum

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the Paragon 2000 barbarian to kill gum

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.970 
the Paragon 2000 barbarian to kill gum
and<00:05:14.270> that's<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.330> pretty<00:05:15.510> big<00:05:15.660> difference<00:05:15.980> what

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
and that's a pretty big difference what

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.350 
and that's a pretty big difference what
kind<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.220> solutions<00:05:17.669> could<00:05:17.910> there<00:05:18.060> be<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.270> this

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
kind of solutions could there be to this

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.600 
kind of solutions could there be to this
problem<00:05:18.750> people<00:05:19.470> have<00:05:19.620> suggested<00:05:19.830> putting<00:05:20.520> a

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
suggest that that's the curve that

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.320 
suggest that that's the curve that
increases<00:05:47.820> until<00:05:48.440> 750<00:05:50.090> should<00:05:51.090> keep

increases until 750 should keep
increasing<00:05:51.660> as

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.450 

you<00:05:55.169> go<00:05:55.319> higher<00:05:55.499> and<00:05:55.710> higher<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.129> paragon

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
you go higher and higher in the paragon

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.149 
you go higher and higher in the paragon
levels<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:57.149> it's<00:05:57.300> less<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.779> less<00:05:57.929> worth<00:05:58.559> the
