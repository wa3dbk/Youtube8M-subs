so mr. zeroD has a condition called

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.519 
so mr. zeroD has a condition called
retinitis<00:00:02.399> pigmentosa<00:00:02.780> it's<00:00:03.780> an<00:00:03.959> inherited

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
retinitis pigmentosa it's an inherited

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.190 
retinitis pigmentosa it's an inherited
disease<00:00:04.730> that<00:00:05.730> involves<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.690> degeneration

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
disease that involves the degeneration

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.379 
disease that involves the degeneration
of<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.859> cell<00:00:08.130> type<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.880> retina<00:00:09.179> called

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
of a cell type in the retina called

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.440 
of a cell type in the retina called
photoreceptors<00:00:10.400> these<00:00:11.400> photoreceptors<00:00:11.790> are

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
photoreceptors these photoreceptors are

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.430 
photoreceptors these photoreceptors are
sort<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.200> pixels<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.830> our<00:00:14.099> eyes<00:00:15.440> over

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
sort of like the pixels in our eyes over

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.820 
sort of like the pixels in our eyes over
the<00:00:16.529> course<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.580> lose<00:00:18.330> our

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
the course of time we lose our

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.170 
the course of time we lose our
light-sensitive<00:00:19.830> cells<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.550> respond<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
light-sensitive cells that respond to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540 
light-sensitive cells that respond to
low<00:00:21.449> light<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.439> become<00:00:22.769> night

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
low light and so we can become night

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
low light and so we can become night
blind<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.960> condition<00:00:25.380> early

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
blind when we have this condition early

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.750 
blind when we have this condition early
on<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> subset<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.930> patients<00:00:28.580> they<00:00:29.580> go

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
on and in a subset of patients they go

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.339 
on and in a subset of patients they go
on<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.090> losing<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.810> their<00:00:31.050> sight

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
on to losing all of their sight

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.069 
on to losing all of their sight
including<00:00:31.710> their<00:00:32.130> central<00:00:32.550> vision<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> mr.

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
including their central vision so mr.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
including their central vision so mr.
Zarra<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> has<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.890> condition<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.670> that's

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
Zarra it has this condition and that's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
Zarra it has this condition and that's
exactly<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.110> device<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.739> designed<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
exactly what this device was designed to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.479 
exactly what this device was designed to
help<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.200> retina<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.770> patients<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
help the retina in these patients is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.540 
help the retina in these patients is
relatively<00:00:42.120> healthy<00:00:43.219> except<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
relatively healthy except for the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
relatively healthy except for the
photoreceptors<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:45.899> trying

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
photoreceptors and so what we're trying

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.590 
photoreceptors and so what we're trying
to<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> replace<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.210> function<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.510> these

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to do is replace the function of these

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
to do is replace the function of these
lost<00:00:48.960> photoreceptors<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> rental

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
lost photoreceptors with the rental

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.170 
lost photoreceptors with the rental
prosthesis

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
prosthesis

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
prosthesis
there<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> approximately<00:00:52.100> 1.2<00:00:53.100> million

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
there are approximately 1.2 million

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
there are approximately 1.2 million
cells<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> retina<00:00:54.690> called<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> ganglion

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
cells in the retina called the ganglion

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.029 
cells in the retina called the ganglion
cells<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.340> form<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> optic<00:00:57.180> nerve<00:00:58.039> we

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
cells and they form the optic nerve we

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
cells and they form the optic nerve we
learned<00:00:59.309> several<00:01:00.180> decades<00:01:00.510> ago<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> those

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
learned several decades ago that those

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
learned several decades ago that those
cells<00:01:01.829> remain<00:01:02.399> relatively<00:01:02.910> viable<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
cells remain relatively viable and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.890 
cells remain relatively viable and
healthy<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> retinal<00:01:05.460> prosthesis

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
healthy and so the retinal prosthesis

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.500 
healthy and so the retinal prosthesis
communicates<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.110> those<00:01:07.380> nerves<00:01:08.150> in<00:01:09.150> order

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
communicates with those nerves in order

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
communicates with those nerves in order
to<00:01:09.780> send<00:01:10.049> sight<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> brain<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.580> very

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to send sight to the brain it's a very

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.350 
to send sight to the brain it's a very
delicate<00:01:11.939> device<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.799> an<00:01:13.920> array<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
delicate device and it's an array of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
delicate device and it's an array of
electrodes<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> lay<00:01:17.520> on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
electrodes that actually have to lay on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.580 
electrodes that actually have to lay on
a<00:01:17.850> curved<00:01:18.270> surface<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> eye

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a curved surface in the back of the eye

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.390 
a curved surface in the back of the eye
where<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.250> retina<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:22.130> after<00:01:23.130> many<00:01:23.340> years

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
where the retina is so after many years

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.600 
where the retina is so after many years
of<00:01:23.790> development<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.330> practice<00:01:25.610> I've

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of development and practice I've

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.050 
of development and practice I've
developed<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> skill<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.290> area

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
developed a lot of skill in this area

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
developed a lot of skill in this area
and<00:01:30.060> basically<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.470> place<00:01:31.860> an<00:01:32.040> electronics

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and basically we place an electronics

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.840 
and basically we place an electronics
package<00:01:33.180> around<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> eye<00:01:34.670> fixate<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
package around the eye fixate that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
package around the eye fixate that
electronics<00:01:36.450> package<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.740> enter

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
electronics package and then we enter

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.679 
electronics package and then we enter
through<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> eye<00:01:38.640> wall<00:01:39.030> through<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> white

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
through the eye wall through the white

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.560 
through the eye wall through the white
part<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> eye<00:01:40.369> with<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.549> electrode<00:01:42.090> that's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
part of the eye with an electrode that's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
part of the eye with an electrode that's
six<00:01:43.380> by<00:01:43.590> ten<00:01:43.860> electrodes<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.880> patients<00:01:45.270> have

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
six by ten electrodes so patients have

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.410 
six by ten electrodes so patients have
60<00:01:46.380> points<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> stimulation<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
60 points of stimulation and that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
60 points of stimulation and that
electrode<00:01:48.930> lays<00:01:49.170> upon<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> retina<00:01:50.070> through<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
electrode lays upon the retina through a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030 
electrode lays upon the retina through a
cable<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.630> carefully<00:01:51.899> secure<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.890> then

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cable that we carefully secure and then

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
cable that we carefully secure and then
we<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> patch<00:01:53.610> graft<00:01:53.930> over<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> incision

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
we put a patch graft over the incision

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.830 
we put a patch graft over the incision
that<00:01:56.340> allows<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.909> device<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> enter<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> eye

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that allows this device to enter the eye

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
that allows this device to enter the eye
so<00:01:58.259> there's<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> portion<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so there's actually a portion of the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
so there's actually a portion of the
device<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.329> outside<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> eye<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
device that's outside of the eye and a

transmitter beams visual information

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.369 
transmitter beams visual information
into<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.000> implant<00:02:35.420> which<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.900> around<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.349> eye

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
into the implant which is around the eye

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.039 
into the implant which is around the eye
and<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:37.430> implant<00:02:37.819> interprets<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.629> and

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
and the implant interprets that and

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.800 
and the implant interprets that and
sends<00:02:39.440> series<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:39.980> impulses<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.329> retina

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
sends series of impulses to the retina

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.839 
sends series of impulses to the retina
which<00:02:42.349> are<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:42.650> interpreted<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.370> vision<00:02:43.700> by

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
which are then interpreted as vision by

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.209 
which are then interpreted as vision by
the<00:02:43.909> brain
