 good good kids 23-8 true 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.479
 has not been bad in the game so 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.830
 who were the politicians on this map but 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.110
 A) Yes 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.270
 may have done a little more luck 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.860
 with both of them but I liked the 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.860
 departure 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.110
 let's see how alarm you always want 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.280
 that brings you different game modes 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.690
 so I have to try to see that 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.490
 I played because many of you are tired 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.920
 of a come expected low confirmed but 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:20.710
 I still want to see 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:23.140
 how are we going and we have 183 of 250 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.330

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.480

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.480

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
