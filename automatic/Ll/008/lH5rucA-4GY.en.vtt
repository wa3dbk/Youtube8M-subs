can't believe I didn't think about this
earlier<00:00:03.840> when<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.049> was<00:00:04.080> making<00:00:04.350> my<00:00:04.529> auto<00:00:04.830> tower

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
earlier when I was making my auto tower

farm<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> main<00:00:11.429> component<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
farm like this is the main component and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.970 
farm like this is the main component and
this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.259> need<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.740> make<00:00:13.860> it

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
this is all you need to do to make it

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.910 
this is all you need to do to make it
work<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.540> well<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> am<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:16.260> well<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> timing

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
work so well I am like well the timing

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
work so well I am like well the timing
is<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> little<00:00:17.160> too<00:00:17.430> fast<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.539> simple

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
is a little too fast it's really simple

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
is a little too fast it's really simple
to<00:00:18.900> make<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.590> need<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> hopper<00:00:20.520> clock

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
to make all you need is a hopper clock

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
to make all you need is a hopper clock
which<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.619> easy<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.130> make

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
which is actually really easy to make

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
which is actually really easy to make
I'm<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.180> make<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.869> right<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.500> from

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I'm gonna just make one right here from

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
I'm gonna just make one right here from
scratch<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.760> need<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.060> hoppers

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
scratch you just need to have hoppers

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.140 
scratch you just need to have hoppers
face<00:00:27.840> each<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.400> comparators<00:00:29.939> on

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
face each other they need comparators on

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.860 
face each other they need comparators on
each<00:00:30.599> hopper<00:00:31.460> blocks<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.730> both<00:00:33.030> sides

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
each hopper blocks on both sides

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.370 
each hopper blocks on both sides
redstone<00:00:34.770> next<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> blocks<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.380> then

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
redstone next to the blocks and then

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.639 
redstone next to the blocks and then
some<00:00:38.129> sticky<00:00:38.460> pistons<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.750> redstone<00:00:40.050> block

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
some sticky pistons and a redstone block

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
some sticky pistons and a redstone block
let's<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> steal<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.170> put

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
let's go and steal that and then you put

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
let's go and steal that and then you put
things<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.629> part<00:00:45.899> right

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
things in here and then this part right

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.970 
things in here and then this part right
here<00:00:46.430> creates<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> pulse<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.719> whenever<00:00:49.500> it's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
here creates a pulse so whenever it's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
here creates a pulse so whenever it's
whenever<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.910> um<00:00:51.090> goes<00:00:51.930> through<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> full<00:00:52.410> cycle

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
whenever it um goes through a full cycle

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.639 
whenever it um goes through a full cycle
it<00:00:53.399> pulls<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.480> once<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.230> comes<00:00:55.440> back

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it pulls off so once this one comes back

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
it pulls off so once this one comes back
over<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.100> well<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> show

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
over here well we can just kind of show

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
over here well we can just kind of show
it<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.680> pulse<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it over here this will pulse and I just

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
it over here this will pulse and I just
put<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> into<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.359> inverter<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> way

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
put it into an inverter so that way

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
put it into an inverter so that way
instead<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.039> being<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> off

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
instead of being on all the time and off

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.140 
instead of being on all the time and off
for<00:01:03.690> 1<00:01:04.379> tick<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.610> small<00:01:05.909> amount<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
for 1 tick or a very small amount of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
for 1 tick or a very small amount of
time<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> might<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> taker<00:01:07.920> 2<00:01:08.549> or

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
time I think it might be a taker 2 or

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
time I think it might be a taker 2 or
something<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.869> 4<00:01:10.229> leg<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.770> means<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
something it's on 4 leg which means it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.730 
something it's on 4 leg which means it
activates<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> system<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.290> means<00:01:13.560> if

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
activates the system here which means if

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
activates the system here which means if
there<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.100> let's<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.430> say<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> lot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> stacks

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
there was let's just say a lot of stacks

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
there was let's just say a lot of stacks
of<00:01:15.780> stuff<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.280> every

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
of stuff in here it would go off every

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
of stuff in here it would go off every
couple<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.909> minutes<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:19.140> gives<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.830> than

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
couple of minutes which gives more than

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
couple of minutes which gives more than
enough<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:21.119> let's<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.630> say<00:01:21.890> melons

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
enough time for let's just say melons

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.539 
enough time for let's just say melons
and<00:01:23.130> pumpkins<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:24.140> happen<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.740> no<00:01:26.310> one's<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and pumpkins to happen so no one's of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
and pumpkins to happen so no one's of
pumpkins<00:01:26.909> bro<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.740> need<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pumpkins bro and then we just need to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.210 
pumpkins bro and then we just need to
wait<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> system<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.689> work<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
wait for the system to work we can just

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
wait for the system to work we can just
kind<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> trick<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:32.970> taking<00:01:33.600> out

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
kind of trick it by taking out

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
kind of trick it by taking out
everything<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:35.040> once<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.490> comes<00:01:35.700> back

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
everything and then once it comes back

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.530 
everything and then once it comes back
to<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.450> cycle<00:01:37.369> we'll<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.759> magic<00:01:39.150> just

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to this cycle we'll have some magic just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.380 
to this cycle we'll have some magic just
get<00:01:39.720> ready<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.439> gonna<00:01:40.560> happen<00:01:40.909> come<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
get ready it's gonna happen come on you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929 
get ready it's gonna happen come on you
can<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.340> put<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.430> hope<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.850> many

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
can do it I put I hope there's so many

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.190 
can do it I put I hope there's so many
melons<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.659> gonna<00:01:45.780> take<00:01:45.960> them<00:01:46.079> off

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
melons in there it's gonna take them off

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.300 
melons in there it's gonna take them off
but<00:01:46.890> when<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.610> happens<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.149> will<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> awesome

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
but when it happens it will be awesome

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.330 
but when it happens it will be awesome
there<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.579> boom<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there we go boom right there so with the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
there we go boom right there so with the
changes<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> slime<00:01:54.180> blocks<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> actually

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
changes to the slime blocks it actually

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.050 
changes to the slime blocks it actually
pushes<00:01:55.259> entities<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:56.100> means<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.729> if

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
pushes entities which means that if

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.749 
pushes entities which means that if
there<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.869> blocks<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.460> pushed

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
there are blocks here they get pushed

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.840 
there are blocks here they get pushed
and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.659> turned<00:02:01.170> into<00:02:01.850> harvestable

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and then they turned into harvestable

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.590 
and then they turned into harvestable
loops<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.390> makes<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> lossless<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:05.600> this

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
loops so it makes it lossless now this

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.449 
loops so it makes it lossless now this
is<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.530> simple<00:02:07.860> compared<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> all

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
is kind of very simple compared to all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
is kind of very simple compared to all
the<00:02:08.580> other<00:02:08.789> melon<00:02:09.509> farms<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> lot<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.170> them<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the other melon farms a lot of them to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.900 
the other melon farms a lot of them to
have<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> ton

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
have a ton

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.670 
have a ton
Hopper's<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.600> lot<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.930> them<00:02:12.020> have<00:02:12.170> repeaters

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
Hopper's a lot of them have repeaters

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.650 
Hopper's a lot of them have repeaters
and<00:02:12.710> stuff<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.250> they're<00:02:13.400> very<00:02:13.940> very<00:02:14.270> expensive

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
and stuff so they're very very expensive

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.030 
and stuff so they're very very expensive
to<00:02:15.020> make<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.710> turn<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.920> off

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
to make I'm just going to turn it off

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.010 
to make I'm just going to turn it off
this<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.090> really<00:02:17.360> simple<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.930> need

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
this one is really simple all you need

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.630 
this one is really simple all you need
to<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.260> make<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.590> tea<00:02:18.770> pattern<00:02:19.160> out<00:02:19.580> of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
to do is make it a tea pattern out of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.730 
to do is make it a tea pattern out of
slime<00:02:19.970> blocks<00:02:20.270> put<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.110> slime<00:02:21.320> block<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
slime blocks put a slime block in the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.440 
slime blocks put a slime block in the
center<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.310> oh<00:02:22.400> he<00:02:22.520> needs<00:02:22.670> two<00:02:22.970> dirt<00:02:23.180> blocks

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
center then oh he needs two dirt blocks

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.660 
center then oh he needs two dirt blocks
have<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.470> them<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.620> your<00:02:24.860> farmland<00:02:25.160> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
have one of them be your farmland and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.310 
have one of them be your farmland and
put<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.270> piston<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.690> connects<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> your

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
put a piston that connects to your

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
put a piston that connects to your
hopper<00:02:27.590> clock<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.340> can<00:02:28.550> also<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:29.300> expand

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
hopper clock you can also really expand

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.540 
hopper clock you can also really expand
on<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:30.200> easily<00:02:30.440> because<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.040> just

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
on this really easily because you just

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.260 
on this really easily because you just
know<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.720> repeater<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.950> now<00:02:34.880> your

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
know put a repeater here and now your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.000 
know put a repeater here and now your
hopper<00:02:35.720> clock<00:02:35.930> kind<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.320> continues<00:02:36.770> for<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
hopper clock kind of continues for a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.790 
hopper clock kind of continues for a
long<00:02:37.100> distance<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.870> out<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.350> it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
long distance go and out of it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.460 
long distance go and out of it
you<00:02:40.580> put<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.940> redstone<00:02:41.120> down<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.080> now<00:02:42.410> you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
you put the redstone down and now you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.620 
you put the redstone down and now you
can<00:02:42.740> easily<00:02:42.980> expand<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.210> do<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
can easily expand on this so we do that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.660 
can easily expand on this so we do that
and<00:02:45.020> all<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:45.920> need<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> do<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.460> make<00:02:46.640> sure

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
and all we need to do is make sure

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.100 
and all we need to do is make sure
there's<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.000> block<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.640> put<00:02:50.630> our<00:02:50.750> piston

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
there's a block like so put our piston

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.130 
there's a block like so put our piston
down<00:02:51.550> piston<00:02:52.550> down<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.030> then<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.690> build

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
down piston down and then we just build

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.170 
down piston down and then we just build
the<00:02:54.230> thing<00:02:54.410> again<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:55.040> want<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.520> just<00:02:55.970> kind

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
the thing again so you want to just kind

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.570 
the thing again so you want to just kind
of<00:02:56.210> put<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.600> blocks<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.140> T<00:02:57.350> shape<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.430> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
of put the blocks in the T shape and you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.250 
of put the blocks in the T shape and you
have<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> one<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.180> bottom<00:02:59.360> extending<00:03:00.080> out

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
have the one in the bottom extending out

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.410 
have the one in the bottom extending out
I'll<00:03:01.130> pick<00:03:01.220> up<00:03:01.340> some<00:03:01.520> dirt<00:03:02.020> dirt<00:03:03.020> dirt<00:03:03.140> that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I'll pick up some dirt dirt dirt that

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.540 
I'll pick up some dirt dirt dirt that
that<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.900> you're<00:03:06.290> good<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.460> can

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
that and you're good to go so you can

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.910 
that and you're good to go so you can
also<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.150> know<00:03:08.180> put<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.990> closer<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.710> just

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
also you know put it closer in I just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.740 
also you know put it closer in I just
kind<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.100> made<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> guess<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.420> now<00:03:11.450> if

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
kind of made a guess with it so now if

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.080 
kind of made a guess with it so now if
all<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.170> all<00:03:12.320> connected<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.860> again<00:03:13.160> it'll

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
all this is all connected up again it'll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.460 
all this is all connected up again it'll
all<00:03:14.360> work<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.870> should<00:03:15.080> be<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.440> know

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
all work that should be you know

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.100 
all work that should be you know
farmland<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.520> that's<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.060> idea<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.959> have

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
farmland but that's the idea so you have

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.550 
farmland but that's the idea so you have
a<00:03:18.170> system<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.750> it's<00:03:20.750> automated<00:03:21.140> so

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
a system like this and it's automated so

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560 
a system like this and it's automated so
you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.070> also<00:03:22.370> stack<00:03:22.790> these<00:03:23.000> up<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.450> way<00:03:23.540> you

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
you can also stack these up that way you

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.390 
you can also stack these up that way you
only<00:03:23.660> need<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.170> large<00:03:24.410> wall<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.040> maybe<00:03:25.220> just

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
only need one large wall and maybe just

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.160 
only need one large wall and maybe just
one<00:03:25.670> water<00:03:25.940> stream<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.420> can<00:03:26.450> stack<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.810> up<00:03:26.990> and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
one water stream you can stack it up and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
one water stream you can stack it up and
really<00:03:27.410> really<00:03:27.740> high<00:03:27.920> or<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.850> can<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.090> it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
really really high or you can have it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.580 
really really high or you can have it
kind<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.450> be<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.600> little<00:03:29.660> longer<00:03:30.080> depending<00:03:30.530> on

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
kind of be a little longer depending on

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.870 
kind of be a little longer depending on
how<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.770> wanna<00:03:30.950> do<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.340> will<00:03:31.520> be<00:03:31.640> really

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
how you wanna do it this will be really

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.930 
how you wanna do it this will be really
quick<00:03:32.560> all<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.830> need<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.250> really<00:03:34.550> do<00:03:34.670> after

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
quick all you need to really do after

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.370 
quick all you need to really do after
that<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.330> make<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.720> repeater<00:03:36.230> system<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:39.050> let's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
that is make a repeater system so let's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.949 
that is make a repeater system so let's
just<00:03:39.560> take<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.070> put<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.670> here<00:03:40.970> throw<00:03:41.810> down

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
just take this put that here throw down

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.199 
just take this put that here throw down
a<00:03:41.989> repeater<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:42.920> now<00:03:43.130> all<00:03:43.340> we<00:03:43.459> have<00:03:43.610> now

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
a repeater and then now all we have now

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.630 
a repeater and then now all we have now
will<00:03:44.390> have<00:03:44.510> inverters<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.380> just<00:03:45.640> invert

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
will have inverters so we just invert

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.120 
will have inverters so we just invert
the<00:03:47.800> thing<00:03:48.800> like<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:51.380> now<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.890> one

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
the thing like so and then now this one

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.280 
the thing like so and then now this one
will<00:03:52.430> be<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.880> new<00:03:53.239> block<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.840> then<00:03:54.020> we<00:03:54.140> can

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
will be the new block and then we can

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.500 
will be the new block and then we can
build<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:54.590> top<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.820> like<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.300> so

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
build on top of it just like that so

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.410 
build on top of it just like that so
actually<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:56.840> one's<00:03:57.020> probably<00:03:57.320> much<00:03:57.739> better

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
actually this one's probably much better

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.650 
actually this one's probably much better
is<00:03:59.420> this<00:04:00.050> enough<00:04:00.470> nice<00:04:00.890> one<00:04:01.220> wait<00:04:01.760> yeah<00:04:02.360> okay

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
is this enough nice one wait yeah okay

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.150 
is this enough nice one wait yeah okay
so<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.050> actually<00:04:03.350> enough<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:03.770> you<00:04:03.860> just

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
so this is actually enough so you just

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.090 
so this is actually enough so you just
do<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.489> exactly<00:04:04.640> like<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.100> you're

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
do it exactly like that and you're

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.850 
do it exactly like that and you're
you're<00:04:07.430> good<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.820> go

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
you're good to go

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.310 
you're good to go
so<00:04:09.860> once<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.220> Redstone<00:04:10.610> is<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:10.970> connected

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
so once the Redstone is all connected

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.500 
so once the Redstone is all connected
and<00:04:12.610> then<00:04:13.610> we<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.880> need<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.180> do<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.390> same

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
and then we just need to do the same

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.729 
and then we just need to do the same
thing<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.900> other<00:04:14.959> side<00:04:15.110> which<00:04:15.410> means<00:04:15.620> that

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
thing on the other side which means that

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.629 
thing on the other side which means that
you<00:04:15.800> take<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:17.090> put<00:04:17.419> down<00:04:17.570> a

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
you take this you put down a

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.390 
you take this you put down a
mm<00:04:20.120> yeah<00:04:20.719> you<00:04:20.749> can<00:04:20.989> put<00:04:21.139> down<00:04:21.259> a<00:04:21.319> repeater<00:04:21.769> or

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
mm yeah you can put down a repeater or

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.830 
mm yeah you can put down a repeater or
actually<00:04:22.849> I<00:04:23.060> don't<00:04:23.150> even<00:04:23.360> think<00:04:23.599> you<00:04:23.689> need<00:04:23.780> a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
actually I don't even think you need a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.119 
actually I don't even think you need a
repeater<00:04:24.139> at<00:04:24.289> that<00:04:24.409> point<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.860> go<00:04:24.979> with

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
repeater at that point you just go with

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.480 
repeater at that point you just go with
the<00:04:25.280> one<00:04:25.699> thing<00:04:26.169> one<00:04:27.169> thing<00:04:27.229> redstone<00:04:27.860> put

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
the one thing one thing redstone put

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.080 
the one thing one thing redstone put
that<00:04:28.610> down

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
that down

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.869 
that down
and<00:04:29.289> then<00:04:30.289> you<00:04:30.409> just<00:04:30.590> build<00:04:30.830> up<00:04:31.039> like<00:04:31.249> this<00:04:31.639> and

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
and then you just build up like this and

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.760 
and then you just build up like this and
while<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.479> are<00:04:32.509> only<00:04:32.930> getting<00:04:33.110> 2<00:04:33.499> per

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
while you are only getting 2 per

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.409 
while you are only getting 2 per
remember<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.789> be<00:04:34.849> lossless<00:04:35.270> so

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
remember this is going to be lossless so

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.730 
remember this is going to be lossless so
as<00:04:35.539> high<00:04:35.689> as<00:04:35.749> as<00:04:35.960> well<00:04:36.169> as<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.499> has<00:04:36.560> many

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
as high as as well as it has many

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.159 
as high as as well as it has many
pumpkins<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.580> have<00:04:37.729> there<00:04:37.999> it's<00:04:38.900> just

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
pumpkins that you have there it's just

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.110 
pumpkins that you have there it's just
going<00:04:39.319> to<00:04:39.439> be<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.770> really<00:04:40.189> really<00:04:40.639> fast<00:04:40.909> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
going to be a really really fast and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.800 
going to be a really really fast and
awesome<00:04:41.509> system<00:04:43.120> let's<00:04:44.120> check<00:04:44.330> do<00:04:44.509> you<00:04:44.629> need

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
awesome system let's check do you need

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.499 
awesome system let's check do you need
the<00:04:45.639> okay<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.669> do<00:04:46.879> need<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.150> repeaters

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
the okay you do need the repeaters

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.200 
the okay you do need the repeaters
perfectly<00:04:48.499> let's<00:04:49.430> put<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:49.699> no<00:04:50.029> you<00:04:50.090> do

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
perfectly let's put that there no you do

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.489 
perfectly let's put that there no you do
not<00:04:50.330> need<00:04:50.659> the<00:04:50.749> repeater<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.139> was<00:04:51.259> just<00:04:51.379> like

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:51.499 
not need the repeater I was just like

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.290 
not need the repeater I was just like
trying<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.770> double-check<00:04:52.069> as<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.400> kind<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.699> dirt

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
trying to double-check as I kind of dirt

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.129 
trying to double-check as I kind of dirt
there<00:04:53.509> for<00:04:53.719> a<00:04:53.750> moment

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
there for a moment

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.050 
there for a moment
so<00:04:54.560> as<00:04:54.680> high<00:04:54.979> as<00:04:55.039> this<00:04:55.310> wall<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.669> all<00:04:55.819> you<00:04:55.939> need

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
so as high as this wall is all you need

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.670 
so as high as this wall is all you need
is<00:04:56.180> one<00:04:56.389> water<00:04:56.629> stream<00:04:56.930> one<00:04:57.169> hopper<00:04:57.560> and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
is one water stream one hopper and

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.320 
is one water stream one hopper and
you're<00:04:57.860> good<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.129> go

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
you're good to go

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.550 
you're good to go
after<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.449> initial<00:04:59.599> clock<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.229> can<00:05:00.379> time

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
after the initial clock you can time

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.159 
after the initial clock you can time
that<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:01.069> would<00:05:01.370> just<00:05:01.550> put<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.819> you<00:05:01.939> know<00:05:02.169> three

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
that I would just put it you know three

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.320 
that I would just put it you know three
or<00:05:03.349> four<00:05:03.379> stacks<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.069> here<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.819> won't<00:05:05.060> go<00:05:05.210> off

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
or four stacks in here it won't go off

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.059 
or four stacks in here it won't go off
as<00:05:05.599> often<00:05:06.169> but<00:05:06.349> should<00:05:06.529> get<00:05:06.680> everything<00:05:07.009> a

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
as often but should get everything a

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.580 
as often but should get everything a
nice<00:05:07.219> chance<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.729> grow<00:05:07.969> pushes<00:05:08.840> away<00:05:09.139> water

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
nice chance to grow pushes away water

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.769 
nice chance to grow pushes away water
stream<00:05:09.979> hopper<00:05:10.490> collecting<00:05:11.180> boom<00:05:11.539> right

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
stream hopper collecting boom right

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.990 
stream hopper collecting boom right
there<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:12.259> that's<00:05:12.830> an<00:05:12.979> automatic<00:05:13.129> lossless

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
there so that's an automatic lossless

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.369 
there so that's an automatic lossless
melon<00:05:14.300> farmer<00:05:14.569> I<00:05:14.629> think<00:05:14.870> that's<00:05:15.020> about<00:05:15.139> as

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
melon farmer I think that's about as

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.019 
melon farmer I think that's about as
good<00:05:15.680> as<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.949> can<00:05:16.099> make<00:05:16.279> it<00:05:16.430> right<00:05:16.580> now<00:05:16.639> I

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
good as you can make it right now I

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.019 
good as you can make it right now I
think<00:05:17.360> that's<00:05:17.509> gonna<00:05:17.779> be<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> best<00:05:19.029> melon

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
think that's gonna be the best melon

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.149 
think that's gonna be the best melon
farm<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.539> can<00:05:20.689> make<00:05:20.900> which<00:05:21.379> does<00:05:21.680> really

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
farm that you can make which does really

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.140 
farm that you can make which does really
expand<00:05:22.729> on<00:05:23.029> my<00:05:23.240> auto<00:05:23.569> tower<00:05:24.020> design<00:05:25.150> instead

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
expand on my auto tower design instead

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.839 
expand on my auto tower design instead
of<00:05:26.210> having<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.569> melon<00:05:26.930> farm<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.439> can<00:05:28.430> go<00:05:28.669> and

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
of having this melon farm I can go and

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.429 
of having this melon farm I can go and
upgrade<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.330> this<00:05:29.479> one<00:05:29.689> it's<00:05:30.229> gonna<00:05:30.349> be

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
upgrade it to this one it's gonna be

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.829 
upgrade it to this one it's gonna be
actually<00:05:31.400> cheaper<00:05:31.969> to<00:05:32.060> make<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.449> degree<00:05:32.599> as

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
actually cheaper to make to a degree as

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.879 
actually cheaper to make to a degree as
long<00:05:32.960> as<00:05:33.020> you<00:05:33.080> have<00:05:33.169> a<00:05:33.199> lot<00:05:33.319> of<00:05:33.349> slime<00:05:33.560> blocks

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
long as you have a lot of slime blocks

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.369 
long as you have a lot of slime blocks
and<00:05:34.159> it's<00:05:34.729> going<00:05:34.969> to<00:05:35.089> be<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.210> lot<00:05:35.659> more<00:05:35.839> lossless

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
and it's going to be a lot more lossless

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.059 
and it's going to be a lot more lossless
and<00:05:36.589> just<00:05:37.430> really<00:05:37.729> really<00:05:38.120> good<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.360> have<00:05:38.509> so
