path at all I went down it don't make
the<00:00:27.720> same<00:00:27.960> mistake<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.010> when<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.460> comes<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the same mistake so when it comes to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.359 
the same mistake so when it comes to
diet<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.349> increase<00:00:31.980> your

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
diet you need to actually increase your

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.620 
diet you need to actually increase your
mouth<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.850> crazy<00:00:33.239> amount<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mouth for a crazy amount of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.500 
mouth for a crazy amount of
carbohydrates<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> fat<00:00:35.399> low

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.660 

because<00:00:41.079> when<00:00:41.260> Candida<00:00:41.800> mushrooms<00:00:42.430> out<00:00:42.579> of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
because when Candida mushrooms out of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.530 
because when Candida mushrooms out of
control<00:00:43.030> it's<00:00:43.720> due<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.980> fat<00:00:45.420> lining<00:00:46.420> the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
control it's due to the fat lining the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.200 
control it's due to the fat lining the
bloodstream<00:00:47.020> not<00:00:47.710> allowing<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.280> sugar<00:00:48.730> to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
bloodstream not allowing the sugar to

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.270 
bloodstream not allowing the sugar to
leave<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.809> blood<00:00:50.020> so<00:00:50.470> sugar<00:00:50.920> feeds<00:00:51.100> our

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
leave the blood so sugar feeds our

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.580 
leave the blood so sugar feeds our
Candida<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:52.150> then<00:00:52.570> we<00:00:52.720> got<00:00:52.900> this<00:00:53.260> big

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
Candida and then we got this big

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.160 
Candida and then we got this big
mushroom<00:00:54.460> fungus<00:00:55.059> thing<00:00:55.420> going<00:00:55.809> on<00:00:55.930> in<00:00:56.050> your

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
