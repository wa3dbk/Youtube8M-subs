00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the moment of society because sometimes 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.190
 it takes more than for 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.220
 miraculous to take something positive 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.600
 of this one of this field not but the truth 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.760
 which is very difficult we do not know what 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.380
 what they play are one of the best 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.890
 teams of the world are first in the 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.930
 league have a class of players that 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 they do not see habitually and well an error 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.650
 you pay dearly and good 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.320
 pitifully for us in the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.180
 second time we made a mistake and there 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.130
 the match opened at some point 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.080
 you saw that it was possible to score here with 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.280
 the club playing the league when maybe 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.719
 a little bit with nerves 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.250
 I know that obviously because in the first 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.650
 time we did things good way 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420
 first name 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.980
 the truth that we knew that the first 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.450
 15 minutes of the second time were going to be 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.220
 fundamental because from there 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.510
 we could play with the desperation of 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.489
 them but but good 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.230
 they did things that too you have to 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.239
 give him merit if they knew how to open the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.309
 match that was closed which you want 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.199
 which is the stop that has the most merit of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.120
 those of today that I miss them 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.250
 hand one in the second part a header 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 of bartra with which one you stay 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 if I have the moon it is very difficult not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.640
 I'm leaving myself a little sad for the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.340
 result but good but the positive is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.080
 we did what we could for 45 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 minutes and from there we were made 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.840
 all very uphill the last two and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.159
 very fast I have to explain what 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.410
 happened in the corner how do you think 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.960
 stay there at that moment of the game 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.600
 it does not happen that good at that moment I thought 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.860
 that the ball came out of neymar was very 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.690
 I live did not put the foot 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 and then the first thing that occurred to me 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 as it was so far from the arch that we 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.530
 take fast for him through him and good 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.240
 I already knew that the yellow one was coming 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.570
 at that time I went through my head 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 that and well the truth that I would have to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.530
 have cleared from first before 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 try to let the door kick go 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.729
 and there for when the message of the tata 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.840
 martino saying hey you're going to be the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.619
 goalkeeper of the selection 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.860
 no no, that I do not know, I only 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.570
 I train day to day to get that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.970
 touch do it in the best way when 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.399
 when I play carla real and good is the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.680
 last time I got the call to 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.170
 the selection but I take it with a lot 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.750
 calm and knowing that I'm still a boy 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.120
 for to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 to be the starting goalkeeper not from my 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.590
 country but I'm wanting to learn 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.970
 desire to progress and wanting to be 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.970
 there do not do terror jer√≥nimos
