but I don't see anything challenging

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.649 
but I don't see anything challenging
about<00:03:08.219> removing<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.700> players<00:03:08.969> ability<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
about removing the players ability to

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.449 
about removing the players ability to
properly<00:03:09.930> gauge<00:03:10.349> where<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> shot<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.129> going<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
properly gauge where a shot is going to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.099 
properly gauge where a shot is going to
be<00:03:11.549> heading<00:03:12.000> that's<00:03:12.389> just<00:03:12.629> a<00:03:12.689> cheap<00:03:12.930> way<00:03:13.049> to

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
be heading that's just a cheap way to

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.170 
be heading that's just a cheap way to
make<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.439> game<00:03:13.590> artificially<00:03:14.370> difficult<00:03:14.939> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
make the game artificially difficult and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.970 
make the game artificially difficult and
this<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.169> something<00:03:16.439> that<00:03:16.469> really<00:03:16.650> affects

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
this is something that really affects

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.589 
this is something that really affects
the<00:03:17.040> game<00:03:17.250> quite<00:03:17.489> fundamentally<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.329> often

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
the game quite fundamentally you often

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.420 
the game quite fundamentally you often
end<00:03:18.690> up<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.079> spamming<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.709> fire<00:03:19.949> button<00:03:20.250> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
end up just spamming the fire button to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.890 
end up just spamming the fire button to
make<00:03:20.549> sure<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.940> hit<00:03:21.120> your<00:03:21.299> intended<00:03:21.599> target

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
make sure you hit your intended target

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.140

too much this was obviously the
direction<00:04:10.650> they<00:04:10.739> wanted<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:11.009> take<00:04:11.129> this<00:04:11.310> game

not the most patient person in the world
like<00:04:24.539> me<00:04:24.570> then<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.469> should<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.650> something<00:04:25.979> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
like me then that should be something to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.160 
like me then that should be something to
keep<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.520> mind
