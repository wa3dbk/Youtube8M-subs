these<00:00:51.000> two<00:00:51.210> videos<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:53.219> brother

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
these two videos here I my brother

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
these two videos here I my brother
recorded<00:00:54.090> actually<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.570> he<00:00:54.719> did<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> video

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
recorded actually when he did a video

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.560 
recorded actually when he did a video
from<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.649> math<00:00:56.309> easy<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.940> how<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> basically

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
from my math easy on how to basically

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260 
from my math easy on how to basically
install<00:00:57.960> your<00:00:58.109> hard<00:00:58.350> disk<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.239> he

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
install your hard disk and so when he

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
install your hard disk and so when he
was<00:01:00.329> recording<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.109> video<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.770> bloater

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
was recording this video here I bloater

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
was recording this video here I bloater
earlier<00:01:02.699> exceed<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> video<00:01:03.239> link<00:01:03.359> below<00:01:03.539> as

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
earlier exceed a video link below as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
earlier exceed a video link below as
well<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.080> basically<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.979> video<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
well but basically this video on the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
well but basically this video on the
iphone<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.810> recorded<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.010> no

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
iphone he recorded with but there was no

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880 
iphone he recorded with but there was no
pause<00:01:08.430> button<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.840> there's<00:01:10.110> no<00:01:10.229> pause<00:01:10.470> button

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
pause button if there's no pause button

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
pause button if there's no pause button
so<00:01:11.070> basically<00:01:11.580> he<00:01:12.030> had<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:12.900> files

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so basically he had got two files

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.539 
so basically he had got two files
separately<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.460> only

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
separately here so then this is only

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
separately here so then this is only
part<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> file<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.080> he<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.470> then

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
part of the file and then he would then

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.960 
part of the file and then he would then
this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> second<00:01:17.520> part<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> how<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this is the second part of how to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
this is the second part of how to
install<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> hard<00:01:18.659> disk<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.259> computer

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
install your hard disk on your computer

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
install your hard disk on your computer
it's<00:01:20.580> basically<00:01:20.880> before<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> uploaded<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it's basically before I uploaded I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's basically before I uploaded I
needed<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> merge<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.500> two<00:01:22.560> files<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
needed to merge these two files and I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
needed to merge these two files and I
found<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:24.060> online<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.810> MPEG<00:01:25.259> streamclip

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
here so now we have the two videos

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.940 
here so now we have the two videos
merged<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.509> into<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.290> well<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
merged all into one here well it is you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
can see them all they aren't merge it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
can see them all they aren't merge it
but<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.380> trim

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
but you can see them you could trim

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.789 
but you can see them you could trim
easily<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> edit<00:02:03.659> etc<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.740> i

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
easily just by going to edit etc but i

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
easily just by going to edit etc but i
just<00:02:05.369> wanted<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> merge<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.240> files

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
just wanted to merge these two files

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
just wanted to merge these two files
here<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.290> those<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.619> files<00:02:07.799> wanted<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
here so that those two files wanted to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
here so that those two files wanted to
merge<00:02:08.399> them<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:08.849> upload<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
merge them in and then upload them so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
merge them in and then upload them so
basically<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> could<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
basically just go you could just go to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
basically just go you could just go to
file<00:02:12.000> export

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
file export

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.200 
file export
to<00:02:13.380> whatever<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.130> or<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.520> click<00:02:14.670> export<00:02:15.150> a

to whatever you or just click export a
quicktime<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:17.160> comes<00:02:17.490> up<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.660> would

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
quicktime and this comes up here I would

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
quicktime and this comes up here I would
usually<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.230> quality<00:02:19.590> I'll<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.710> pick<00:02:20.040> one

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
usually the quality I'll just pick one

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.160 
usually the quality I'll just pick one
hundred<00:02:21.060> percent<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.450> file<00:02:21.660> size<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.930> going

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
hundred percent the file size is going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.680 
hundred percent the file size is going
to<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.530> big<00:02:22.860> though<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.570> can

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
to be really big though but then you can

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
to be really big though but then you can
also<00:02:24.720> compress<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.740> handbrake<00:02:26.280> with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
also compress them with handbrake with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.580 
also compress them with handbrake with
you<00:02:26.880> see<00:02:27.060> my<00:02:27.180> video<00:02:27.420> link<00:02:27.660> below<00:02:27.870> spacek<00:02:28.380> aliyu

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
could read their about it so you could

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180 
could read their about it so you could

further but this is all I wanted it for

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.720 
further but this is all I wanted it for
just<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.290> convert<00:02:37.710> these<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.250> click<00:02:38.490> make

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
just to convert these so just click make

just to convert these so just click make
a<00:02:38.760> movie<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.240> it's<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:39.540> easy<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.620> call

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
a movie so it's really easy just call

a movie so it's really easy just call
this<00:02:41.100> merged<00:02:42.890> video<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.720> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this merged video so we have this just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.180 
this merged video so we have this just
click<00:02:46.350> Save<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.880> now<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.770> should<00:02:49.980> take<00:02:50.160> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
click Save and now it's it should take a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.250 
click Save and now it's it should take a
while<00:02:50.430> actually<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:51.360> compressing<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.110> got

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
while actually it's compressing I got

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.750 
while actually it's compressing I got
about<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:52.590> hundred<00:02:52.650> percent<00:02:52.830> compression<00:02:53.580> or

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
about one hundred percent compression or

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.390 
about one hundred percent compression or
converting<00:02:54.600> or<00:02:55.290> joining<00:02:55.770> or<00:02:55.950> whatever<00:02:56.190> i'm

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
converting or joining or whatever i'm

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.010 
converting or joining or whatever i'm
not<00:02:56.640> too<00:02:56.970> sure<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.330> means<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
not too sure what that means but it just

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.949 
not too sure what that means but it just
quality<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.800> gonna<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.160> good<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.959> yeah

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
quality is gonna be really good and yeah

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.360 
quality is gonna be really good and yeah
it's<00:03:01.170> basically<00:03:01.500> well<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:01.800> will<00:03:01.980> take<00:03:02.160> quite

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it's basically well this will take quite

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.449 
it's basically well this will take quite
a<00:03:02.430> bit<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.240> yeah<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.740> this<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.250> take

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
a bit so yeah that's so this would take

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.380 
a bit so yeah that's so this would take
probably<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.840> probably<00:03:07.230> had<00:03:07.350> 10<00:03:07.560> 15<00:03:08.390> minutes

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
probably it probably had 10 15 minutes

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.880 
probably it probably had 10 15 minutes
actually<00:03:09.510> probably<00:03:09.840> less<00:03:10.050> than<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.740> is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
actually probably less than that this is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.860 
actually probably less than that this is
probably<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.910> pearl<00:03:12.090> around<00:03:12.300> 10<00:03:12.480> minutes<00:03:12.660> i

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
probably a pearl around 10 minutes i

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.810 
probably a pearl around 10 minutes i
think<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.860> at<00:03:14.010> nine<00:03:14.250> percent<00:03:14.640> or

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
think so it's at nine percent or

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.100 
think so it's at nine percent or
whatever<00:03:15.090> I'll<00:03:15.240> just<00:03:15.300> pause<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:16.020> I'll

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
whatever I'll just pause it here I'll

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.479 
whatever I'll just pause it here I'll
get<00:03:16.260> back<00:03:16.440> when<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.830> bit<00:03:16.950> pummels<00:03:17.310> done

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
get back when it's a bit pummels done

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.370 
get back when it's a bit pummels done
okay<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.180> yeah<00:03:18.480> basically<00:03:18.720> waited<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.140> 10

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
okay so I yeah basically waited like 10

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
okay so I yeah basically waited like 10
minutes<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.800> almost<00:03:20.040> done<00:03:20.630> finishing<00:03:21.630> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
minutes it's almost done finishing this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.860 
minutes it's almost done finishing this
up<00:03:22.110> let's<00:03:22.800> just<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.160> how<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.370> looks<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.000> sure

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
up let's just see how it looks here sure

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470 
up let's just see how it looks here sure
where's<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> file<00:03:25.760> okay<00:03:26.760> let's<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:27.150> look<00:03:27.300> at

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
where's the file okay let's just look at

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
where's the file okay let's just look at
this<00:03:27.630> okay<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> files<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.190> should

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
this okay so this is a files it should

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.770 
this okay so this is a files it should
update<00:03:30.239> soon<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.500> ninety-eight<00:03:32.010> percent<00:03:32.780> 99

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
update soon to ninety-eight percent 99

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.600 
update soon to ninety-eight percent 99
soon<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.620> almost<00:03:34.830> done<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
soon it's almost done you can see the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.240 
soon it's almost done you can see the
encoding<00:03:35.880> movie<00:03:36.300> at<00:03:36.620> 449<00:03:37.620> things<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.220> a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
encoding movie at 449 things like a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.449 
encoding movie at 449 things like a
couple<00:03:38.519> seconds<00:03:38.850> left<00:03:39.470> 50<00:03:40.470> let's<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.190> wait

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
couple seconds left 50 let's just wait

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:50.509 
couple seconds left 50 let's just wait
it<00:03:41.610> up<00:03:43.760> ok<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:44.820> it's<00:03:45.209> complete<00:03:49.220> ok<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.280> it's

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
it up ok so it's complete ok so it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.210 
it up ok so it's complete ok so it's
complete<00:03:50.910> here<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.269> was<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> 10<00:03:52.140> gig<00:03:52.440> file<00:03:52.830> ox

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
complete here this was a 10 gig file ox

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.180 
complete here this was a 10 gig file ox
this<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.489> pretty<00:03:53.730> huge<00:03:54.000> acuta<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:56.010> could

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
this is pretty huge acuta you could

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.770 
this is pretty huge acuta you could
basically<00:03:56.519> compress<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.300> now<00:03:57.540> with

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
basically compress this now with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.229 
basically compress this now with
handbrake<00:03:58.220> yeah<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.760> see<00:03:59.940> here

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
handbrake yeah so as you can see here

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.910 
handbrake yeah so as you can see here
this<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.019> handbrake<00:04:01.440> program<00:04:01.800> that

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
this this is the handbrake program that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.960 
this this is the handbrake program that
I<00:04:01.980> used<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.190> compress<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:02.880> basically

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
I used to compress it but basically

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.270 
I used to compress it but basically
these<00:04:03.690> two<00:04:03.900> files<00:04:04.140> would<00:04:04.320> come<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.800> combine

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
these two files would come we combine

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.610 
these two files would come we combine
them<00:04:05.430> into<00:04:05.519> this<00:04:05.670> merge<00:04:05.970> video<00:04:06.390> file<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.110> it's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
them into this merge video file and it's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.949 
them into this merge video file and it's
it's<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.850> doubled<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:09.390> length<00:04:09.660> here's<00:04:09.900> a

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
it's it's doubled this length here's a

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.509 
it's it's doubled this length here's a
22<00:04:10.470> minutes<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:10.890> three<00:04:11.040> seconds<00:04:11.340> two<00:04:11.430> minutes

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
22 minutes and three seconds two minutes

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.610 
22 minutes and three seconds two minutes
15<00:04:11.970> notes<00:04:12.150> four<00:04:12.390> minutes<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> day<00:04:12.810> three<00:04:13.110> but

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
15 notes four minutes a day three but

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.680 
15 notes four minutes a day three but
it's<00:04:13.769> 10<00:04:14.010> gig<00:04:14.280> size<00:04:14.580> because<00:04:14.940> what<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.209> does<00:04:15.239> is

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
it's 10 gig size because what it does is

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.500 
it's 10 gig size because what it does is
because<00:04:16.350> these<00:04:16.680> are<00:04:16.890> these<00:04:17.340> files<00:04:17.760> they're

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
because these are these files they're

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.150 
because these are these files they're
they're<00:04:18.870> actually<00:04:19.320> already<00:04:19.440> compressed<00:04:19.890> with

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
they're actually already compressed with

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.340 
they're actually already compressed with
in<00:04:20.489> order<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.880> merge<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.299> as<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.690> decompress

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
in order to merge it as to decompress

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.710 
in order to merge it as to decompress
them<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.820> just<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.090> make<00:04:24.300> them<00:04:24.479> really

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
them and just just make them really

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.240 
them and just just make them really
really<00:04:24.870> large<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.650> combine

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
really large and then combine

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.100 
really large and then combine
together<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.270> then<00:04:27.390> this<00:04:27.510> is<00:04:27.660> this<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
together so then this is this is the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.650 
together so then this is this is the
uncompressed<00:04:28.650> file<00:04:29.070> here<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.240> that's<00:04:30.450> why

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
uncompressed file here so that's why

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.630 
uncompressed file here so that's why
then<00:04:31.350> when<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.710> use<00:04:31.830> his<00:04:31.950> hand<00:04:32.160> brake<00:04:32.310> program

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
then when to use his hand brake program

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.010 
then when to use his hand brake program
you<00:04:32.700> can<00:04:32.760> see<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> video<00:04:33.150> link<00:04:33.270> below<00:04:33.510> i'm<00:04:33.840> not

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
you can see the video link below i'm not

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.600 
you can see the video link below i'm not
going<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.200> do<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.320> on<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.620> video<00:04:34.890> but<00:04:35.130> once

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
going to do it on this video but once

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.670 
going to do it on this video but once
you<00:04:35.700> compress<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.360> using<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.440> get<00:04:37.620> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you compress it using this you get a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.640 
you compress it using this you get a
like<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.210> compress<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.360> change<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.780> mp4<00:04:40.080> files

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
like I compress and change to mp4 files

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.530 
like I compress and change to mp4 files
so<00:04:40.920> this<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.220> can<00:04:41.370> see<00:04:41.520> from<00:04:41.670> here<00:04:41.760> it's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
so this is you can see from here it's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.690 
so this is you can see from here it's
the<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.290> exact<00:04:44.040> same<00:04:44.070> one<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.550> these

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
the it's the exact same one is these

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.370 
the it's the exact same one is these
ones<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.180> 53<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.660> can<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.260> it's

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
ones for 53 you can see that and it's

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.050 
ones for 53 you can see that and it's
the<00:04:46.710> size<00:04:46.920> is<00:04:47.100> actually<00:04:47.340> smaller<00:04:47.490> than<00:04:47.760> both

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
the size is actually smaller than both

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.330 
the size is actually smaller than both
of<00:04:48.090> these<00:04:48.360> than<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.320> minimum<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.800> this<00:04:49.920> one<00:04:50.130> so

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
of these than the minimum of this one so

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.610 
of these than the minimum of this one so
as<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.520> can<00:04:50.610> see<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.060> open<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.360> one<00:04:51.620> and

you can see in the video link below but
that's<00:05:16.260> all<00:05:16.410> for<00:05:16.590> if<00:05:16.710> we<00:05:16.800> learn<00:05:16.950> how<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.270> merge

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
that's all for if we learn how to merge

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.930 
that's all for if we learn how to merge
not<00:05:19.140> move<00:05:19.410> files<00:05:19.770> that's<00:05:20.130> all<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.340> had<00:05:20.580> suffer
