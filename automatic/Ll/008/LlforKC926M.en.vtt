00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.980 
octopus
these<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.380> spiny<00:00:28.920> dogfish<00:00:29.670> sharks<00:00:30.119> did

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
these are spiny dogfish sharks did

these are spiny dogfish sharks did
anybody<00:00:31.470> ask<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> octopus<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.270> I

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
anybody ask the octopus about this I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.350 
anybody ask the octopus about this I
knew<00:00:37.340> what<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> aquarium<00:00:38.879> folks<00:00:39.149> are

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
knew what the aquarium folks are

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
knew what the aquarium folks are
thinking<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> octopus<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.160> its

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thinking is that the octopus can use its

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
thinking is that the octopus can use its
ability<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.000> camouflage<00:00:42.510> itself<00:00:43.140> as

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
protection and if that doesn't work it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
protection and if that doesn't work it
has<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> strength<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.190> fight<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> shark

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
has the strength to fight off the shark
