you<00:01:27.659> normally<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.499> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> called<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you normally would and this is called a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
you normally would and this is called a
lace<00:01:30.329> braid<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.109> you<00:01:31.259> only<00:01:31.439> add<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
lace braid because you only add it on to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.889 
lace braid because you only add it on to
one<00:01:32.520> side<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> hair<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
one side of the hair so it's kind of

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.020 
one side of the hair so it's kind of
like<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.289> French<00:01:34.890> braid<00:01:35.189> except<00:01:35.609> you<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:35.819> add

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like a French braid except you don't add

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
like a French braid except you don't add

the trick to this braid is just to keep
tightening<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.709> little<00:01:40.950> strands<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.399> hair<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
tightening the little strands of hair to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.339

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
make sure it stays nice and neat and

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.929 
make sure it stays nice and neat and
doesn't<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.649> too<00:01:43.859> messy<00:01:44.219> up<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.490> top<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.849> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
doesn't get too messy up on top of the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.029 
doesn't get too messy up on top of the
head<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.599> continue<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.319> lace<00:01:46.500> braid<00:01:46.829> for

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039

head you can continue the lace braid for
as<00:01:47.130> far<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.459> you<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:47.609> to<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.359> head<00:01:48.539> but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
as far as you want to go on the head but

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
as far as you want to go on the head but
I'm<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.079> gonna<00:01:49.170> stop<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> right<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I'm just gonna stop it right in the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.099 
I'm just gonna stop it right in the
middle<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.789> it<00:01:50.939> doesn't<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.329> too<00:01:51.390> far<00:01:51.599> but

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
middle so that it doesn't go too far but

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.839 
middle so that it doesn't go too far but
you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.469> even<00:01:52.859> make<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.130> crown<00:01:53.520> of

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
once you're done you can just end it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859
