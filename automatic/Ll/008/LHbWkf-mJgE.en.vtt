00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.490
 have you ever wondered why people from the Victorian era where the fc 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.829
 SEVILLA 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 there is an excellent reason behind this frowning mine 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.699
 the break time 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.539
 she is quite motionless for 90 seconds but not so 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.699
 easy as it sounds 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.699
 photography takes time and light 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.070
 its story is actually that of the interaction between these two elements 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.770
 on the photographic plate and inside the camera 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.490
 and that's also the story of the efforts 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 to make the most of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 photography is a relatively young art 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.370
 actually telekom 18 126 when nicéphore niépce 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.170
 after many attempts the eight sites in France to take a picture of 

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:06.009
 his garden by means of a slap heels driving bitumen 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.910
 if the photo is very fuzzy and it will require no less than eight hours of 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.930
 rest time 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.320
 it is nevertheless the first permanent photographic image in the world 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.290
 however with a break time of eight hours this technique is not very 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 practice and take portraits completely exclude 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.650
 actively praised the debates war a colleague of the crumbs pursues 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.820
 experiments until he discovered a faster method in eighteen 139 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.200
 the daguerreotype 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.079
 whose image is fixed on a silver-plated copper plate makes its entrance to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.030
 Paris 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 this is the first commercially viable photographic trial 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.870
 if crumbs to the east was alive yet maybe the story would have 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.180
 retained the name of neither access to tic 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.530
 the daguerreotype know instant popularity 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 despite its fairly high cost 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.829
 we could say that the rest of the story was a frantic race 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.209
 to reduce the pause time and make photography less laborious 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.659
 in eighteen 166 a visit to a photography studio 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.279
 to get a portrait 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.999
 means to stay marble for 10 to 90 seconds depending on the 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.499
 light available 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.639
 a special device called posture support lg kind not to move 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.649
 during the taking of the picture 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:41.559
 imperative order of the photographer look at the little roof 0 as well as the 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.409
 people will not even move the Innu which would have caused a fuzzy effect 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.749
 the slightest movement of 18 tons makes it look like 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.429
 thank you 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.189
 the trial of the philippe photographer improve greatly in 18 years 4 20 8 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.970
 with the arrival of the camera for a snapshot 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.969
 that allow people to take their own pictures 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.639
 technology has come a long way since 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.959
 the movie that is now more and more room for memory cards 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.069
 in digital devices 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.979
 photography is so much a part of modern life that most people 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.109
 have a hard time imagining the world without it 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.839
 cinema television they allow but would not exist since 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.829
 all have their origin in photography 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.750
 crumb and dagger was far from suspecting what is happening to us from time to time 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:32.849
 time
