00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.860
 the hotel for me super comfortable 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.170
 my husband for years and it is 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.040
 simply perfecting the light 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.060
 optimally we feel as if we are after 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.410
 go home 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 and so we are also tested 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.579
 The rooms are clean and tidy 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.579
 There is air conditioning 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.399
 small bathroom with everything you need 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:42.399
 the staff is friendly 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.409
 speaks very good German helps one 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.869
 all sorts of things again our 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:51.780
 Occurrence of questions the pool is always 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.949
 squeaky clean 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.610
 You can lie in the water 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.780
 go 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.119
 it is perfect 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.210
 so else have to the hotel too 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:07.179
 chosen because it is centrally located 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.039
 a few meters to the beach and a 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:12.179
 few minutes until you are in the city 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.179
 and can stroll 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.050
 1a and it is still every year 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 better again and has more 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.900
 In the meantime we are even better 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 already at four stars you have great 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.950
 next to the breakfast lunch 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.619
 in between a little tea again 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 and in the evening you have a dinner 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 The buffet could take all that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.830
 The cook also explained everything you did 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 Tastes are always tasty 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.860
 fresh 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 it is typically Turkish but still 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.300
 Do you have European things with you? 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.700
 so that was in need of improvement 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.780
 I myself attacked the music 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.550
 the selection 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 that is more homogeneous but that is us 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 actually the only thing 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.250
 could be improved in my opinion 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.970
 but it has been clear now 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.970
 better
