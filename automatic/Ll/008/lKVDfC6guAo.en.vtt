00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.090 
weaving but I like to knit from them and
I<00:01:19.850> think<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.229> putting<00:01:21.229> your<00:01:21.259> little<00:01:21.740> bits<00:01:21.920> of

spinning<00:01:45.140> if<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.979> take<00:01:46.189> regular<00:01:46.520> roving<00:01:47.119> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
spinning if you take regular roving and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.870 
spinning if you take regular roving and
you<00:01:47.390> pre-draft<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.469> then<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.070> wind<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.759> on

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
you pre-draft it and then you wind it on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.410 
you pre-draft it and then you wind it on
to<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.020> toilet<00:01:51.380> paper<00:01:51.590> core<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.210> place

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
to the toilet paper core then you place

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.499 
to the toilet paper core then you place
it<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.020> cone<00:01:54.229> holder<00:01:54.969> as<00:01:55.969> you're<00:01:56.210> spinning

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
it on the cone holder as you're spinning

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.980 
it on the cone holder as you're spinning
it<00:01:57.130> alleviates<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.430> lot<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.909> work<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.869> makes

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
it alleviates a lot of work and it makes

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.770 
it alleviates a lot of work and it makes
spinning<00:02:00.409> effortless<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:02.149> there<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.390> go<00:02:02.539> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
spinning effortless so there you go and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.959 
spinning effortless so there you go and
it<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:03.110> winds<00:02:03.380> right<00:02:03.649> off<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.610> then<00:02:04.729> we<00:02:04.880> have

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
it just winds right off and then we have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.539 
it just winds right off and then we have
another<00:02:05.060> technique

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
another technique

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.150 
another technique
for<00:02:06.939> using<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.110> weeding<00:02:08.649> when<00:02:08.950> you're

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
for using it and weeding when you're

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.880 
for using it and weeding when you're

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
through the comb core and then you wind

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.740 
through the comb core and then you wind
your<00:02:22.569> warp<00:02:22.840> which<00:02:23.230> will<00:02:23.440> show<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.650> later<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
