PB Teen My Room Rules Christina

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.170
Hi, I'm Christina, and this is my room.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:18.210
Right here is my dresser. My dresser's a 
really good place to display all the pictures that I take.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.110
I'm really into photography. This is a card that 
my best friend Allie made for me for my birthday.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.260
Um, it's designed around my favorite book series, 
the Twilight books.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.070
so it's really special to me. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
Speaking of books, I really like cheerleading, it's one 
of my favorite things to do.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.270
Right here is my settee. Um, this is a 
really good place to read, 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.070
or listen to music or watch TV.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.110
Right here is my sea glass that me and my 
brother collected when we went to Bermuda.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.020
Um, it was really fun, we'd go in the water and collect 
all the sea glass that we could find.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.200
This is my guitar. I got it from my grandfather, 
I like to play around with it,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.250
I can't play it real well, but it's fun.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.180
Over here are my pictures. It's just a collection 
of really cool stuff.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.180
I actually drew this myself, C,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.180
and here's a picture I took of my little brother.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.220
Right here is my bed. I love everything about my bed.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.010
I love the colors and all the pillows. 
Yellow's my favorite color.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.020
Um, and, right here is my diary. It's 
really important to me to keep track of everything I do,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.260
because I don't want to forget anything when I'm older.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.050
Okay, well that was my room. Bye.
