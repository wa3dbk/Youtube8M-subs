slide so that's kind of a newer feature

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.060 
slide so that's kind of a newer feature
it's<00:02:47.060> not<00:02:47.240> new<00:02:47.600> specifically<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> PowerPoint

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
it's not new specifically the PowerPoint

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.770 
it's not new specifically the PowerPoint
2013<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> fairly<00:02:50.959> recent<00:02:51.610> addition

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
2013 but it is a fairly recent addition

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.990 
2013 but it is a fairly recent addition
now<00:02:53.780> one<00:02:53.989> other<00:02:54.020> way<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:55.100> format<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
now one other way that you can format a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
now one other way that you can format a
video<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.630> want<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> point<00:02:57.140> out<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
video that I want to point out is the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.880 
video that I want to point out is the
ability<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.550> change<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.270> poster<00:02:59.810> frame<00:03:00.050> so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
ability to change the poster frame so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.800 
ability to change the poster frame so
right<00:03:01.160> now<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> video<00:03:02.030> inserted

onto<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.230> slide<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.520> what<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.790> looks

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
onto the slide and this is what it looks

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.510 
onto the slide and this is what it looks
like<00:03:05.120> when<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.260> not<00:03:06.440> playing<00:03:06.860> we<00:03:07.070> have<00:03:07.280> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
like when it's not playing we have this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.780 
like when it's not playing we have this
static<00:03:08.209> image<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.560> change<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.610> is
