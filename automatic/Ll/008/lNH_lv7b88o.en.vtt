00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
side and you can go ahead and scroll

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.230 
side and you can go ahead and scroll
through<00:04:13.819> you<00:04:14.269> can<00:04:14.449> go<00:04:14.629> ahead

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
through you can go ahead

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.740 
through you can go ahead
and<00:04:16.400> even<00:04:17.400> launch<00:04:17.670> let's<00:04:18.420> go<00:04:18.600> ahead<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and even launch let's go ahead and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:32.960 
and even launch let's go ahead and
launch<00:04:19.050> this<00:04:19.260> amplified<00:04:19.830> video<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.760> is

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
launch this amplified video so this is

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.040 
launch this amplified video so this is
an<00:04:33.840> ipad<00:04:34.290> mini<00:04:34.790> karmel<00:04:35.790> these<00:04:36.570> guys<00:04:36.750> are

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
an ipad mini karmel these guys are

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.720 
an ipad mini karmel these guys are
creating<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.530> caramel<00:04:37.980> for<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.310> ipad<00:04:38.700> mini

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
creating the caramel for the ipad mini

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.960 
creating the caramel for the ipad mini
so<00:04:39.620> go<00:04:40.620> ahead<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.010> pause<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.220> video<00:04:41.520> there

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
so go ahead and pause the video there

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.790 
so go ahead and pause the video there
but<00:04:42.000> essentially<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.900> can<00:04:42.930> see<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.230> you<00:04:43.560> can

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
but essentially you can see that you can

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.700 
but essentially you can see that you can
run<00:04:44.220> two<00:04:44.910> apps<00:04:44.940> simultaneously<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:46.230> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
run two apps simultaneously and the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.190 
run two apps simultaneously and the
Galaxy<00:04:47.610> Note<00:04:47.640> 2<00:04:47.850> does<00:04:48.360> have<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.810> quad-core

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
Galaxy Note 2 does have a quad-core

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.130 
Galaxy Note 2 does have a quad-core
Exynos<00:04:50.160> processor<00:04:50.300> along<00:04:51.300> with<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.510> five<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.080> a

Exynos processor along with a five and a

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.770 
Exynos processor along with a five and a
half<00:04:52.200> inch<00:04:52.560> display<00:04:53.010> in<00:04:53.190> two<00:04:53.370> gigs<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.790> RAM<00:04:54.060> so

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
half inch display in two gigs of RAM so

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.570 
half inch display in two gigs of RAM so
there<00:04:54.930> should<00:04:55.110> be<00:04:55.140> plenty<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.590> horsepower<00:04:56.040> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
there should be plenty of horsepower to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.050 
there should be plenty of horsepower to
run<00:04:56.790> two<00:04:57.060> apps<00:04:57.090> side<00:04:57.510> by<00:04:57.690> side<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.730> verizon

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
run two apps side by side on the verizon

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.300 
run two apps side by side on the verizon
addition<00:05:00.840> you'll<00:05:01.080> essentially<00:05:01.500> have<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.980> very

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
addition you'll essentially have a very

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.820 
addition you'll essentially have a very
similar<00:05:02.640> experience<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.750> sprint<00:05:04.530> version

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
similar experience to the sprint version

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.490 
similar experience to the sprint version
however<00:05:05.670> on<00:05:06.060> verizon<00:05:06.540> you'll<00:05:06.690> see<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.170> on

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
however on verizon you'll see that on

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.790 
however on verizon you'll see that on
this<00:05:07.920> tray<00:05:08.730> here<00:05:09.150> doesn't<00:05:09.570> scroll<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.230> you're

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
full keyboard so that's a nice feature

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.640 
full keyboard so that's a nice feature
