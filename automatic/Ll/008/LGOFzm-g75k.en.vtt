00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
by myself all over the racetrack i can

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.200 
by myself all over the racetrack i can
go<00:01:44.230> from<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.530> top<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.950> bottom<00:01:45.210> everywhere

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
go from the top to the bottom everywhere

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.300 
go from the top to the bottom everywhere
and<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.390> freaks<00:01:46.630> everybody<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:47.080> behind<00:01:47.440> me<00:01:47.650> so

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and it freaks everybody out behind me so

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.590
