00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
what do you think we could do I don't

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.610 
what do you think we could do I don't
know<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.260> seemed<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.440> they

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
know it's just they seemed like they

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
know it's just they seemed like they
were<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:35.010> faster<00:00:35.250> than<00:00:35.610> us<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.000> couldn't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
were much faster than us and we couldn't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
were much faster than us and we couldn't
even<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.540> didn't<00:00:36.690> even<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> combo<00:00:37.410> off

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
even we didn't even get the combo off

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
even we didn't even get the combo off
once<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.250> mean<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.210> true<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.809> maybe<00:00:40.260> we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
once I mean that's very true so maybe we

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.280 
once I mean that's very true so maybe we
should<00:00:40.559> splash<00:00:41.070> another<00:00:41.309> color<00:00:41.520> maybe<00:00:41.820> blue

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
should splash another color maybe blue

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
should splash another color maybe blue
yeah<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> bit<00:00:43.770> disappointed<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.340> we

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
yeah I was a bit disappointed because we

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
yeah I was a bit disappointed because we
never<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> combo<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.390> once<00:00:45.629> because

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
never got the combo down once because

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.150 
never got the combo down once because
our<00:00:46.260> opponents<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.860> kept<00:00:47.010> putting

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
our opponents they just kept putting

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
our opponents they just kept putting
down<00:00:47.370> huge<00:00:47.730> threats<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.329> had<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> deal

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
down huge threats that we had to deal

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.299 
down huge threats that we had to deal
with<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.200> else<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.620> lose<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> game<00:00:50.129> we

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
with or else we just lose the game we

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
with or else we just lose the game we
didn't<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.640> time<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:51.989> place

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it's smash like a bug but I think you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's smash like a bug but I think you
have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> point<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.610> splashing<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.600> color

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
have a point i think splashing a color

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.690 
have a point i think splashing a color
with<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.590> could<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.369> i

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
with this that could be very good i

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.289 
with this that could be very good i
think<00:01:15.060> either<00:01:15.770> blue<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> said<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:18.210> we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
think either blue like you said then we

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
think either blue like you said then we
can<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:18.930> mana<00:01:19.170> leaks<00:01:19.470> some<00:01:20.159> Ponder's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
can put in some mana leaks some Ponder's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
can put in some mana leaks some Ponder's
this<00:01:21.030> deck<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> things<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this deck I think one of the things that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
this deck I think one of the things that
this<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.040> suffers<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.729> note<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this like really suffers from is note it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
this like really suffers from is note it
does<00:01:24.479> nothing<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.960> turn<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.380> yeah<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.070> mean

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
does nothing on turn one yeah I mean

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
does nothing on turn one yeah I mean
almost<00:01:26.640> every<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.000> deck<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> turn<00:01:27.659> one

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
almost every other deck has a turn one

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
almost every other deck has a turn one
play<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.350> either<00:01:28.470> delver<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.540> doomed

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
play you have either delver or doomed

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
play you have either delver or doomed
traveler<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.350> birds<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.070> paradise<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.880> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
traveler or birds of paradise and we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
traveler or birds of paradise and we
just<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.570> pass<00:01:33.900> every<00:01:34.470> single<00:01:34.740> turn<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just we just pass every single turn I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
just we just pass every single turn I
think<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.280> giving<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> if

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
think we're giving up a lot there so if

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
think we're giving up a lot there so if
we<00:01:36.570> could<00:01:36.720> play<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> blue<00:01:37.770> pre-ordained

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
we could play like a blue pre-ordained

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
we could play like a blue pre-ordained
or<00:01:38.640> something<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
or something I think that would go a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
or something I think that would go a
long<00:01:39.930> way<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.470> obviously<00:01:40.619> mana<00:01:41.159> leaks

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
long way and then obviously mana leaks

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.469 
long way and then obviously mana leaks
would<00:01:41.579> help<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.090> maybe<00:01:42.210> some

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
would help and then maybe some

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
would help and then maybe some
dissipates<00:01:42.960> even<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.740> nice<00:01:43.950> hard

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
dissipates even just like nice hard

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
dissipates even just like nice hard
counter<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> late<00:01:44.850> game<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> want<00:01:45.720> some

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
end of turn but with sundial it works

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.550 
end of turn but with sundial it works
nicely<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.330> also<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.990> course<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:39.410> that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
nicely and also of course the one that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
nicely and also of course the one that
everyone<00:02:39.770> knows<00:02:40.040> works<00:02:40.340> well<00:02:40.550> with<00:02:40.640> sundial

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
everyone knows works well with sundial

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.170 
everyone knows works well with sundial
is<00:02:41.650> sudden<00:02:42.650> disappearance<00:02:43.130> where<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.850> exile

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
is sudden disappearance where you exile

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.700 
is sudden disappearance where you exile
all<00:02:44.390> their<00:02:44.570> stuff<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.050> then<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.380> send<00:02:45.590> out

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
all their stuff and then you send out

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.590 
all their stuff and then you send out
and<00:02:45.890> they<00:02:45.950> never<00:02:46.070> get<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.400> back<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.760> those<00:02:47.480> are

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
and they never get it back so those are

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.940 
and they never get it back so those are
two<00:02:47.630> very<00:02:47.750> nice<00:02:48.110> additions<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.740> deck

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
two very nice additions to this deck

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.160 
two very nice additions to this deck
however<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.400> think<00:02:49.760> if<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.360> post<00:02:50.720> dark

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
however I think if the post dark

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.080 
however I think if the post dark
ascension<00:02:51.410> meta<00:02:51.830> looks<00:02:52.100> anything<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.610> what

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
ascension meta looks anything like what

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.820 
ascension meta looks anything like what
we<00:02:53.120> played<00:02:53.420> against<00:02:53.720> today<00:02:53.900> ah<00:02:54.050> amount<00:02:54.710> of

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
we played against today ah amount of

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
I don't know we'd have to do a lot of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760 
I don't know we'd have to do a lot of
testing<00:03:05.120> either<00:03:05.660> way<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.020> deck<00:03:06.230> has<00:03:06.500> mono

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
playing it now or post dark ascension

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.480 
playing it now or post dark ascension
yeah<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.840> ain't<00:03:12.050> cutting<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.710> mean<00:03:13.250> if<00:03:13.370> you

yeah just ain't cutting it I mean if you
play<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.880> less<00:03:14.390> competitive<00:03:14.900> area<00:03:15.080> then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
play in a less competitive area then

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.510 
play in a less competitive area then
yeah<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:15.650> fine<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.250> play<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.430> a

dark<00:03:31.640> ascension<00:03:31.850> cards<00:03:32.240> maybe<00:03:32.420> splash<00:03:32.780> color

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
dark ascension cards maybe splash color

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.660 
dark ascension cards maybe splash color
if<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.410> looks<00:03:33.590> really<00:03:33.740> good<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.010> giving<00:03:34.580> it

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
if it looks really good and giving it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.910 
if it looks really good and giving it
another<00:03:34.850> go<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.360> seeing<00:03:36.110> if<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:36.410> run<00:03:36.590> into<00:03:36.620> any

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
another go and seeing if we run into any

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
another go and seeing if we run into any
other<00:03:37.070> new<00:03:37.250> opponents<00:03:37.670> yeah<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.390> we'll<00:03:38.570> be

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
back next week with a new deck me and I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.830 
back next week with a new deck me and I
don't<00:03:41.060> think<00:03:41.240> we'll<00:03:41.360> have<00:03:41.420> any<00:03:41.540> dark

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
don't think we'll have any dark

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.060 
don't think we'll have any dark
ascension<00:03:42.050> cards<00:03:42.500> because<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:42.890> still<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
ascension cards because it's still a

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.650 
ascension cards because it's still a
while<00:03:43.280> before<00:03:43.490> it<00:03:43.670> gets<00:03:43.790> released<00:03:44.060> online<00:03:44.270> but

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
while before it gets released online but

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.990 
while before it gets released online but
maybe<00:03:45.110> we<00:03:45.740> might<00:03:45.920> be<00:03:46.100> really<00:03:46.310> late<00:03:46.430> who<00:03:46.790> knows

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
maybe we might be really late who knows

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.730 
maybe we might be really late who knows
