had<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.610> put<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.790> up<00:02:16.880> here<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.870> realized

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
had to put it up here and I realized

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.140 
had to put it up here and I realized
that<00:02:18.380> these<00:02:18.590> cameras<00:02:19.070> could<00:02:19.460> be<00:02:19.790> mounted<00:02:19.940> on

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
that these cameras could be mounted on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.510 
that these cameras could be mounted on
the<00:02:20.240> side<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.620> know<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.770> chose<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.310> left

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
the side so you know I chose the left

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.010 
the side so you know I chose the left
for<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> garment<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.450> got<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.750> button

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
for the garment it's got this button

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.020 
for the garment it's got this button
this<00:02:24.200> easy<00:02:24.830> slide<00:02:25.220> switch<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.790> hit<00:02:25.850> this

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
this easy slide switch you can hit this

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.210 
this easy slide switch you can hit this
pimp<00:02:26.300> love<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.660> turn<00:02:26.810> throwing<00:02:27.110> off<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:28.130> don't

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
pimp love to turn throwing off we don't

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.890 
pimp love to turn throwing off we don't
have<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.610> use<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.970> either<00:02:29.150> when<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.600> read<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
have to use that either when I read the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.330 
have to use that either when I read the
instructions<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.710> thing<00:02:30.980> will<00:02:31.130> start

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
instructions this thing will start

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220 
instructions this thing will start
filming<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.030> way<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.330> start<00:02:32.600> moving<00:02:32.720> if<00:02:33.110> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
filming the way you start moving if you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.900 
filming the way you start moving if you
put<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.860> setting<00:02:34.160> oh<00:02:34.370> wow

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
put it on that setting oh wow

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.820 
put it on that setting oh wow
the<00:02:35.210> minute<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.690> detects<00:02:36.050> movement<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.530> starts

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the minute it detects movement it starts

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.290 
the minute it detects movement it starts
recording<00:02:37.160> she<00:02:37.460> don't<00:02:37.670> even<00:02:37.790> really<00:02:38.030> need

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
recording she don't even really need

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.940 
recording she don't even really need
that<00:02:38.510> switch<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> figured<00:02:39.500> let's<00:02:39.650> put<00:02:39.800> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that switch but I figured let's put that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.890 
that switch but I figured let's put that
switch<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> outside<00:02:40.790> anyway<00:02:41.210> but<00:02:41.750> what<00:02:41.840> I

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
switch on the outside anyway but what I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.360 
switch on the outside anyway but what I
found<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> garment<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
found with the garment is that it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.940 
found with the garment is that it
adjusts<00:02:43.850> easily<00:02:44.150> you've<00:02:44.990> got<00:02:45.260> up<00:02:45.620> down<00:02:47.950> this

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
adjusts easily you've got up down this

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.380 
adjusts easily you've got up down this
way<00:02:49.360> you've<00:02:50.360> got<00:02:51.400> side<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.580> side

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.059 

you<00:02:55.900> need<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.350> you've<00:02:56.530> also<00:02:56.710> got<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.950> I'm

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
you need then you've also got and I'm

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.620 
you need then you've also got and I'm
down<00:03:00.280> setting<00:03:00.610> like<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:04.450> thing

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
down setting like this so this thing

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.970 
down setting like this so this thing
seemed<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.050> be<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> most<00:03:05.410> adjustable

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
seemed to be the most adjustable

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.060 
seemed to be the most adjustable
entities<00:03:06.990> out<00:03:07.990> of<00:03:08.140> these<00:03:08.260> two<00:03:08.500> minutes

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630 

and<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:13.850> well<00:03:14.120> has<00:03:14.450> an<00:03:14.630> adjustment<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.640> go

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
and it as well has an adjustment to go

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.910 
and it as well has an adjustment to go
up<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.180> down<00:03:17.360> then<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.290> has<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> lens

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
up and down then it has a lens

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.030 
up and down then it has a lens
adjustment<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:19.850> actually<00:03:20.420> adjusts<00:03:21.040> with

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
adjustment that actually adjusts with

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.070 
adjustment that actually adjusts with
where<00:03:22.340> your<00:03:22.460> lens<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.150> make<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.420> level<00:03:23.570> okay

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
where your lens is to make it level okay

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.520 
where your lens is to make it level okay
so<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.360> turns<00:03:26.600> right<00:03:26.870> right<00:03:27.230> twist

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
so that just turns right right twist

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.070 
so that just turns right right twist
that<00:03:27.710> exactly<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.120> then<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
that exactly and then the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.410 
that exactly and then the
adjustment<00:03:30.910> removing<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> other<00:03:32.240> way

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
adjustment removing it the other way

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.370 
adjustment removing it the other way
works<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:32.870> this

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
works like this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.530 
works like this
so<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.250> set<00:03:34.490> this<00:03:34.640> verb<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.090> want<00:03:35.330> they<00:03:35.510> just

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so you set this verb you want they just

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.650 
so you set this verb you want they just
slide<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.960> back<00:03:36.110> in

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.650 

let's<00:03:39.500> say<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.710> wanted<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.060> sky<00:03:41.300> for

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
let's say I wanted to the sky for

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.350 
let's say I wanted to the sky for
some<00:03:41.810> reason<00:03:42.700> no<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.730> do<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.410> so

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
some reason no I do that so

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.510 
some reason no I do that so
realistically<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.480> think<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.890> garments<00:03:49.460> are

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
realistically I think the garments are

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.480 
realistically I think the garments are
most<00:03:49.700> adjustable<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.800> ghost<00:03:52.040> test<00:03:52.280> is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
most adjustable the ghost test is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.910 
most adjustable the ghost test is
probably<00:03:52.670> second<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.720> pros<00:03:54.290> probably<00:03:54.800> the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
probably second in the pros probably the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.250 
probably second in the pros probably the
least<00:03:55.100> adjustable<00:03:55.640> okay<00:03:56.180> cameras<00:03:56.630> but<00:03:56.750> okay

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
least adjustable okay cameras but okay

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.870 
least adjustable okay cameras but okay
you<00:03:57.680> know<00:03:57.800> really<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.190> reason<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.490> put<00:03:58.730> these

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
you know really the reason I put these

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.450 
you know really the reason I put these
three<00:03:59.240> cameras<00:03:59.630> on<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.870> helmet<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.470> to

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
three cameras on this helmet is to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.580 
three cameras on this helmet is to
determine<00:04:01.850> which<00:04:02.600> camera<00:04:03.140> had<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> better

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
determine which camera had the better

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.320 
determine which camera had the better
clarity<00:04:04.070> had<00:04:04.400> better<00:04:04.640> produce<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.180> better

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
clarity had better produce the better

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.200 
clarity had better produce the better
video<00:04:05.710> but<00:04:06.710> in<00:04:06.830> doing<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.370> realized<00:04:07.820> that

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
video but in doing this I realized that

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.590 
video but in doing this I realized that
I<00:04:08.510> also<00:04:09.200> got<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.590> learn<00:04:09.710> about<00:04:09.860> usability<00:04:10.600> some

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
I also got to learn about usability some

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.000 
I also got to learn about usability some
of<00:04:11.690> these<00:04:11.750> cameras<00:04:12.140> are<00:04:12.260> more<00:04:12.410> intuitive<00:04:12.620> with

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
of these cameras are more intuitive with

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.360 
of these cameras are more intuitive with
the<00:04:13.070> others<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:14.030> my<00:04:14.240> opinion<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.740> GoPros<00:04:16.190> at

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the others in my opinion the GoPros at

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.010 
the others in my opinion the GoPros at
least<00:04:16.549> intuitive<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.540> toughness<00:04:17.750> to

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
least intuitive it's the toughness to

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.320 
least intuitive it's the toughness to
use<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.860> think<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.520> lot<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.790> it<00:04:19.970> starts

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
use and I think that a lot of it starts

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.020 
use and I think that a lot of it starts
from<00:04:20.989> just<00:04:21.320> button<00:04:21.950> function<00:04:22.370> themselves<00:04:22.910> in

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
from just button function themselves in

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.120 
from just button function themselves in
the<00:04:23.090> button<00:04:23.360> design<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.650> buttons<00:04:24.980> aren't

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
the button design the buttons aren't

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.790 
the button design the buttons aren't
labeled<00:04:25.520> there's<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.530> shutter

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
labeled there's that this is the shutter

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.620 
labeled there's that this is the shutter
button<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.760> Wi-Fi<00:04:29.150> button<00:04:29.390> and

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
button and this is the Wi-Fi button and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.750 
button and this is the Wi-Fi button and
this<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> on/off<00:04:30.140> switch<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.400> doesn't

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
this is the on/off switch but it doesn't

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.910 
this is the on/off switch but it doesn't
say<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.630> you've<00:04:33.440> got<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.800> your

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
say that so you've got to have your

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.200 
say that so you've got to have your
instruction<00:04:34.400> manual<00:04:34.430> out<00:04:34.790> when<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.000> try<00:04:35.180> to

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
instruction manual out when you try to

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.300 
instruction manual out when you try to
do<00:04:35.450> anything<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.710> guess<00:04:36.860> once<00:04:37.100> you've

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
do anything and I guess once you've

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.190 
do anything and I guess once you've
worked<00:04:37.940> with<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.240> camera<00:04:38.510> for<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.750> while<00:04:38.810> then

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
worked with a camera for a while then

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.700 
worked with a camera for a while then
you're<00:04:39.350> gonna<00:04:39.440> know<00:04:40.480> what<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.570> does<00:04:41.750> but<00:04:42.170> out

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
you're gonna know what it does but out

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.990 
you're gonna know what it does but out
of<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> box<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.400> was<00:04:43.460> topped<00:04:45.010> so<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.880> know

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
of the box it was topped so I you know

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.640 
of the box it was topped so I you know
they've<00:04:47.150> got<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> Wi-Fi<00:04:47.720> because<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.260> has<00:04:48.500> an

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
they've got the Wi-Fi because it has an

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.350 
they've got the Wi-Fi because it has an
application<00:04:48.800> for<00:04:49.430> your<00:04:49.550> phone<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.090> can

lineup<00:05:06.729> these<00:05:06.939> cameras<00:05:07.449> here<00:05:07.689> by<00:05:07.900> just

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
lineup these cameras here by just

lineup these cameras here by just
utilizing<00:05:08.499> camera<00:05:08.919> in<00:05:09.009> order<00:05:09.129> to<00:05:09.279> line<00:05:09.430> this

one<00:05:09.699> up<00:05:09.819> you<00:05:09.909> have<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.330> optical

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
one up you have to have the optical

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.929 
one up you have to have the optical
right<00:05:11.169> so<00:05:11.469> now<00:05:11.620> you've<00:05:11.830> got<00:05:12.009> to<00:05:12.189> have<00:05:12.370> the

right so now you've got to have the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.149 
right so now you've got to have the
Wi-Fi<00:05:13.479> working<00:05:13.779> to<00:05:14.229> get<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.409> your<00:05:14.620> phone<00:05:14.860> to

see<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.490> app<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:16.569> I<00:05:16.599> got<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:16.990> all<00:05:17.139> downloaded

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
see the app so I got that all downloaded

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.909 
see the app so I got that all downloaded
and<00:05:18.249> I<00:05:18.759> figured<00:05:19.120> once<00:05:19.389> I<00:05:19.569> synced<00:05:20.439> it<00:05:20.529> up<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
and I figured once I synced it up the

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.619 
and I figured once I synced it up the
next<00:05:21.099> time<00:05:21.279> I<00:05:21.400> turn<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.669> camera<00:05:21.849> off<00:05:22.029> and<00:05:22.479> turn

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
next time I turn the camera off and turn

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:23.820 
next time I turn the camera off and turn
it<00:05:22.659> back<00:05:22.840> on<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.139> could<00:05:23.259> be<00:05:23.349> automatically

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
it back on it could be automatically

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.529 
it back on it could be automatically
saved<00:05:24.840> got<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.379> camera

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539

say<00:06:13.690> I'm<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:13.870> most<00:06:13.990> technique<00:06:14.410> guys<00:06:14.620> but<00:06:14.830> I

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
say I'm the most technique guys but I

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.040 
say I'm the most technique guys but I
think<00:06:15.010> I<00:06:15.280> probably<00:06:15.460> intermediate<00:06:16.449> as<00:06:16.660> far<00:06:16.900> as

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
think I probably intermediate as far as

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.840 
think I probably intermediate as far as
using<00:06:17.470> new<00:06:17.590> tech<00:06:17.800> devices<00:06:18.310> out<00:06:18.490> of<00:06:18.610> all<00:06:18.729> these

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
using new tech devices out of all these

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.939 
using new tech devices out of all these
three<00:06:19.240> I<00:06:19.419> think<00:06:19.690> I<00:06:19.750> like<00:06:19.900> to<00:06:19.930> nominate<00:06:20.199> the

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
three I think I like to nominate the

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.920 
three I think I like to nominate the
best<00:06:21.130> now<00:06:21.970> we'll<00:06:22.120> see<00:06:22.270> what<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.479> video<00:06:22.690> comes

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
best now we'll see what the video comes

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.300 
best now we'll see what the video comes
out<00:06:23.020> today<00:06:23.199> the<00:06:23.650> bigger<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:23.979> screen<00:06:24.130> the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
out today the bigger the screen the

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.969 
out today the bigger the screen the
larger<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:24.850> camera<00:06:25.210> I<00:06:25.419> get<00:06:25.930> it<00:06:26.080> but<00:06:26.320> man<00:06:26.650> Joe<00:06:26.949> I

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
larger the camera I get it but man Joe I

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.950

really<00:06:27.040> like<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.550> screen<00:06:27.820> approaches<00:06:28.810> the

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
really like the screen approaches the

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.420 
really like the screen approaches the
