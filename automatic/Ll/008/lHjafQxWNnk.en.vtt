00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.670
 Well I hope that well here 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.480
 I bring an explanatory one this time 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 trick that I discovered from the game the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 science in springfield still mind of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.460
 tricks have not seen it on youtube or anything 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 it's likely that they take it out I do not know if 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 work on all versions in all 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.690
 the terminals I do not know but I've tried it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 and it has served me it is about 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:35.700
 the scratch and win of the bodeguita de apu 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 in which one uses it and once one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.380
 leaves the game and re- enters 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.590
 'scratch and win' other figures appear 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.430
 we explain them so they understand 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.000
 pick this up 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 yes 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.020
 a little volume 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.940
 although then here he scratches and wins what 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.880
 we open 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:07.130
 we buy and we see softly 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:10.040
 here here here and check to see if 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.670
 we win or we do not win something good in this 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.480
 case only a hype came out that are 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 350 the minimum prize we press the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 middle home button 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.140
 here and we left the game 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.950
 go to the window 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 overwhelm my homework coach 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.770
 we closed the simpson app 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.310
 usually it should appear here the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 we finalize 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.700
 norman we released 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 we went out 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.549
 and we reload the game 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.869
 the egg should load where it was 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.869
 because it was in those who won 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.810
 I have used and worked many times 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.850
 as I have also used in some 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 opportunities and for example if you had a 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 jackpot later does not return me to 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.940
 come out in that prize nor a greater one if not 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.060
 I get the minor minor minor so 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.910
 it is to try but most of the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.920
 sometimes I would recommend using it in which the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.230
 minor prize 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.650
 try to see us play for 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650
 continue 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.180
 we have to load 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.550
 and as you will see the restaurant is closed 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.060
 again we see here 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.690
 and as you can see here now I have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.310
 an ax another ax and a bomb 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.500
 all ways the same prize but as 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.500
 they will realize it is fabric 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.380
 dolls figurines have 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.440
 changed 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.570
 you can try to see if they win they win 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 another opportunity has other 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.530
 Winning opportunities 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.770
 I hope you liked it until this 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.250
 small command tutorial to test to see 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.090
 if it serves them and wins in the lottery 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.090
 until next time
