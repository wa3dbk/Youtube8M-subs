 we will bring for all of you how 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.030
 make the masks for the 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.890
 members of the war band and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.809
 can do a better job and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.659
 concentrate even more on what they are 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.489
 carrying out the main objective is 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.560
 cover the eyes of the elements of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.140
 war band and we can make some 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.539
 strips of fabric like scarf type and 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.399
 tie jealousy but good we know that the 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.020
 bandits we like things still 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.430
 better done and we're going to do some 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.380
 mask 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.720
 I have a mask of those of which 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.460
 they are used as to sleep and then I 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.680
 I think that from here we can take the base 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.070
 of the masks we are going to need 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.740
 a piece of foami 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.659
 and we are going to place on the piece of 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.759
 foami the mask and we're going to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.759
 to draw the outline of it 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.300
 with any type of pen or marker 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.440
 and since we have it marked we are going to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.020
 proceed with the scissors to cut it 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.450
 since we cut it we can observe 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.150
 that we have a copy in what is the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.360
 mask but report now what we're going 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.540
 to do is put a cloth I went to 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.850
 Parisian fabrics and I got this fabric that 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.460
 It is very soft very pleasant to the touch 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.770
 and that will prevent us from placing the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.230
 antifaz as well be upset and think 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 much sweat what we are going to do is that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.600
 let's place the piece of foami on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.660
 the fabric and we're going to stick it with silicone 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.810
 and so that the fomín is well pegadito 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 on the canvas then well let's place 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.000
 a lot of silicon especially in the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.800
 outline and a little bit in the center to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.050
 that is all adhered and do not go to 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.420
 to fall since the children then good come 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.350
 to mistreat the team a lot we are going to 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.350
 Start 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 as the silicon is of immediate bonding 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.840
 then we can proceed to cut the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.350
 piece of cloth that has already adhered 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.480
 on the background 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.290
 and for that we are going to use again 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.290
 in our scissors 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.890
 to 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.280
 since I have finished cutting the fabric 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.860
 we can already see that he has a face with 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.990
 fabric and the other face has foam and 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 we are going to verify that it is well pegadito 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.440
 from the sides because that is going to give 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.040
 higher quality of work to our 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040
 mask 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.660
 since it has been perfectly adhered 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.930
 let's make a double to our 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.930
 mask 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.290
 and we are going to make a diagonal cut to 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.290
 that there goes the nose 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.430
 and here we have a perfect mask 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.569
 now let's proceed to place the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.569
 straps to tie it 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.440
 for the straps we are going to return 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.290
 back to our web and we're going to 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.290
 cut two strips of the same size 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.270
 here we already have a strip is not necessary 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.850
 perfect cristera in case I'm all 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.130
 trembling and not and then to perform 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.300
 even more cuts 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.100
 let's cut another strip for the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.630
 next belt 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.520
 this cloth that I bought I do not remember its 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.190
 name has some very qualities 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.790
 special because when I stretch it 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.689
 Acquires other dimensions and does not break 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.680
 see what 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.710
 huge distance of rice 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.810
 stretching and is perfect we are going to 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.030
 proceed to stretch the other remain more 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.030
 thin and more resistant 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.560
 open 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.930
 well we already have two strips and now what 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.090
 let's make some small cuts 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.280
 here to tie those strips 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.280
 let's use our scissors 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.740
 since we made these incisions now 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.060
 let's introduce 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.060
 one of the tips 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.900
 for this incision 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.370
 we pass it on the other side and we make a 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.370
 small knot 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.770
 and on the other side we are going to do the same 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.810
 let's move our tape from the other 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.680
 side let's help here a little bit with the 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.680
 tip of the scissors 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.240
 and we are going to make a small 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.690
 and here we have finished our 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.220
 mask for our band hero ninja 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.510
 but we're going to do more because we have 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.520
 several banderos 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:20.650
 well I already said several I have here 12 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.450
 chiquitito 31 grandote 4 56 more and then 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.800
 well with this I think it would be 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.950
 enough for today we are going to 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.870
 placing them your tapes to everyone as 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.580
 well I finished putting the tapes 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.620
 to all the masks and I already have several 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.780
 to start working on our 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.280
 next class so that now not 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.310
 only the cornets have their mask 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.990
 and also the tellers 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.050
 then well mates with this we give 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.840
 by finished what the mask for the 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.760
 pandero nothing must place the 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.100
 side where the fabric is and each 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.050
 member can be tied up by doing 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.390
 a new single in the back 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.610
 so that they can work without anything 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.220
