so<00:00:02.340> you've<00:00:02.610> just<00:00:02.909> bought<00:00:03.360> your<00:00:03.570> patch<00:00:04.080> map<00:00:04.380> and

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
so you've just bought your patch map and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.070 
so you've just bought your patch map and
brand-new<00:00:05.640> newbie<00:00:06.000> but<00:00:06.420> you're<00:00:06.660> wondering

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
brand-new newbie but you're wondering

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.020 
brand-new newbie but you're wondering
how<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.259> set<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.680> up<00:00:07.770> properly<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.519> optimize

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
how to set it up properly to optimize

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.799 
how to set it up properly to optimize
the<00:00:09.630> usage<00:00:10.820> well<00:00:11.820> there's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.120> few<00:00:12.330> settings

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
the usage well there's a few settings

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.039 
the usage well there's a few settings
that<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.110> change<00:00:13.440> every<00:00:13.860> time<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.960> some<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that we change every time and some of

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.590 
that we change every time and some of
them<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.529> quite<00:00:17.039> obvious<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.119> some<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> them

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
them are quite obvious and some of them

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650 
them are quite obvious and some of them
are<00:00:18.779> not<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.020> obvious<00:00:19.520> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.789> system<00:00:21.270> here

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
are not so obvious in the system here

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
are not so obvious in the system here
under<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.740> keyboard<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
under the keyboard we are going to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.410 
under the keyboard we are going to
change<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:24.930> QWERTY<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.090> alphabetics<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
change it from QWERTY to alphabetics and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.380 
change it from QWERTY to alphabetics and
what<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.050> allows<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.000> putting<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
what that allows is the putting in the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.939 
what that allows is the putting in the
dashes<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.289> searching<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
dashes when you're searching for a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.620 
dashes when you're searching for a
location<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.759> don't<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> flip<00:00:33.420> back

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
location so you don't have to flip back

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
location so you don't have to flip back
and<00:00:33.840> forth<00:00:33.899> between<00:00:34.320> those<00:00:34.710> screens<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.370> the

and forth between those screens all the

and forth between those screens all the
time<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> avoidances<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.920> simply<00:00:38.340> turn

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
time and the avoidances we simply turn

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
time and the avoidances we simply turn
off<00:00:38.610> everything<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.050> there's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
off everything that's in there there's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
off everything that's in there there's
very<00:00:41.040> seldom<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.230> any

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
very seldom that we're going to use any

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
very seldom that we're going to use any
of<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.680> stuff<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.730> gets<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of that stuff and it just gets in the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.310 
of that stuff and it just gets in the
way<00:00:45.920> now<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:48.530> display<00:00:49.530> itself<00:00:51.140> usually<00:00:52.140> isn't

way now the display itself usually isn't

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.340 
way now the display itself usually isn't

550 percent and it's usually in an auto

550 percent and it's usually in an auto

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
mode which whoa because I'm doing this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
mode which whoa because I'm doing this
in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.359> night<00:01:00.600> we'll<00:01:01.230> change<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
in the at night we'll change this to a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.759 
in the at night we'll change this to a
nighttime<00:01:02.520> mode<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.899> interested

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
nighttime mode which I'm not interested

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.810 
nighttime mode which I'm not interested
in<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:08.100> leave<00:01:08.580> those

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in but we would just leave those

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
in but we would just leave those
settings<00:01:09.240> pretty<00:01:09.450> much<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.140> under

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
settings pretty much as they are under

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.700 
settings pretty much as they are under
the<00:01:10.920> map<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.790> crank<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> detail<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> most

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the map we crank the detail up to most

some<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> gps's<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
some of the gps's have don't have that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
some of the gps's have don't have that
high<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.310> least<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
high but at least that's how we we can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.120 
high but at least that's how we we can
do<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.970> we<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.000> interested<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:22.130> seeing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
do it here we are interested in seeing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
do it here we are interested in seeing
our<00:01:23.400> trip<00:01:23.670> log<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> our<00:01:24.479> track<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.140> we

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
our trip log which is our track so we

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.399 
our trip log which is our track so we
turn<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.650> track<00:01:26.009> log<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.750> keeping

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
turn that track log on now it's keeping

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
turn that track log on now it's keeping
a<00:01:28.590> track<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.100> us<00:01:29.220> whether<00:01:29.460> you're<00:01:29.880> looking<00:01:30.030> at

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a track of us whether you're looking at

a track of us whether you're looking at
it<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:31.890> how<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.820> would

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
it or not but that's what how we would

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
it or not but that's what how we would
set<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> case<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.890> I've<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
set it in this case here I've got a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
set it in this case here I've got a

whole bunch of demonstration maps in

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.190 
whole bunch of demonstration maps in
here<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> turn<00:01:39.990> off<00:01:40.290> and

and there's the city Navigator that
would<00:01:47.070> typically<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.090> only<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
would typically be the only one that and

would typically be the only one that and

where the contour lines would be in

where the contour lines would be in
there<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> definitely<00:01:54.869> don't<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.320> to

there so we definitely don't want to
