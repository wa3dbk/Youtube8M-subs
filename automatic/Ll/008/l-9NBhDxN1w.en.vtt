and Technology University of Brighton

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.950 
and Technology University of Brighton
this<00:00:27.369> is<00:00:27.520> basically<00:00:27.939> your<00:00:28.149> drafting<00:00:28.570> machine

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
this is basically your drafting machine

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.670 
this is basically your drafting machine
the<00:00:29.200> whole<00:00:29.410> thing<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.270> it<00:00:31.270> has<00:00:31.540> like

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the whole thing and it has like

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.600 
the whole thing and it has like
systems<00:00:33.219> including<00:00:33.940> one<00:00:35.040> foot<00:00:36.040> pedal<00:00:36.460> like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
systems including one foot pedal like

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.900 
systems including one foot pedal like
this<00:00:36.910> which<00:00:37.899> helps<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.950> adjust<00:00:39.219> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
this which helps you to adjust the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.660 
this which helps you to adjust the
height<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.780> angle<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.980> all<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.370> need<00:00:42.520> to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
height and the angle so all you need to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.389 
height and the angle so all you need to
do<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.390> release<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.989> pedal<00:00:44.469> by<00:00:44.980> pulling

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
do is to release that pedal by pulling

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.689 
do is to release that pedal by pulling
it<00:00:45.609> up<00:00:45.789> and<00:00:45.969> then<00:00:46.870> adjust<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.559> angle<00:00:48.280> like

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
it up and then adjust the angle like

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.259 
it up and then adjust the angle like
this<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.460> height<00:00:51.699> like<00:00:52.149> this<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> it

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
this and the height like this so it

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.059 
this and the height like this so it
looks<00:00:55.269> by<00:00:55.539> you<00:00:55.749> from<00:00:57.390> 90<00:00:58.390> degrees<00:00:59.069> fully

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
looks by you from 90 degrees fully

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:05.460 
looks by you from 90 degrees fully
present<00:01:00.579> off<00:01:02.460> 180<00:01:03.460> degrees<00:01:04.089> fully<00:01:04.510> vertically

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
present off 180 degrees fully vertically

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.850 
present off 180 degrees fully vertically
like<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.240> make<00:01:07.479> sure<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.200> you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
like this but you make sure that you

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.480 
like this but you make sure that you
adjust<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.659> according<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.690> your<00:01:11.490> sitting

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
adjust it according to your sitting

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.499 
adjust it according to your sitting
height<00:01:13.829> then<00:01:14.829> we've<00:01:15.130> got<00:01:15.430> different<00:01:15.880> locking

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
height then we've got different locking

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.969 
height then we've got different locking
mechanisms<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.899> operating<00:01:19.899> your<00:01:20.320> drafting

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
mechanisms for operating your drafting

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.639 
mechanisms for operating your drafting
machine<00:01:21.310> your<00:01:22.060> drafting<00:01:22.479> machine<00:01:22.869> uses<00:01:23.380> two

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
machine your drafting machine uses two

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.569 
machine your drafting machine uses two
different<00:01:25.049> arms<00:01:26.049> one<00:01:26.500> horizontal<00:01:27.219> for<00:01:27.430> me

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
different arms one horizontal for me

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.569 
different arms one horizontal for me
here<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.119> one<00:01:28.390> great<00:01:28.810> go<00:01:29.049> on<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:30.070> very<00:01:30.280> little

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
here and one great go on the very little

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.389 
here and one great go on the very little
on<00:01:30.789> is<00:01:31.030> fixed<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:31.750> doesn't<00:01:32.200> move<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:33.009> you

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
on is fixed it doesn't move and you

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.790 
on is fixed it doesn't move and you
shouldn't<00:01:33.640> touch<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.909> but<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:37.049> vertical

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
shouldn't touch it but for the vertical

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.120 
shouldn't touch it but for the vertical
easily<00:01:39.310> move<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.060> around<00:01:40.210> or<00:01:40.750> throwing<00:01:41.320> things

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
easily move it around or throwing things

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.910 
easily move it around or throwing things
make<00:01:43.030> sure<00:01:43.360> when<00:01:43.630> you're<00:01:43.810> moving<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.530> and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
make sure when you're moving this and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.100 
make sure when you're moving this and
just<00:01:45.160> before<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.090> release<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.810> button

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
just before that you release that button

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
just before that you release that button
in<00:01:47.470> here<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:50.260> key<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:50.950> release<00:01:51.370> mode

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in here so this key is in release mode

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.490 
in here so this key is in release mode
if<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.660> just<00:01:52.900> lock<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.200> like<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:56.260> won't

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
if I just lock it like this it won't

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.420 
if I just lock it like this it won't
move<00:01:56.830> anymore

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
move anymore

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.120 
move anymore
so<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.850> will<00:01:58.030> be<00:01:58.150> fixed<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:59.170> release<00:01:59.680> it<00:01:59.860> fast

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
so it will be fixed so release it fast

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.280 
so it will be fixed so release it fast
and<00:02:00.490> then<00:02:00.760> move<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.420> otherwise<00:02:01.900> you're<00:02:02.170> going

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
and then move it otherwise you're going

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.050 
and then move it otherwise you're going
to<00:02:02.350> damage<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:03.990> again<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:08.130> drafting<00:02:09.130> you've

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
to damage that again for drafting you've

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.410 
to damage that again for drafting you've
got<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.570> pair<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> rulers<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:12.520> horizontal

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
got a pair of rulers one horizontal

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530 
got a pair of rulers one horizontal
ruler<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:14.650> vertical<00:02:15.280> ruler<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.360> can

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
ruler and one vertical ruler and you can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.400 
ruler and one vertical ruler and you can
easily<00:02:17.130> move<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.490> one<00:02:18.850> vertically<00:02:19.750> but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
easily move this one vertically but

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.620 
easily move this one vertically but
again<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.640> you've<00:02:21.940> got<00:02:21.970> another

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
again for this one you've got another

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.740 
again for this one you've got another
locking<00:02:23.170> system<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:23.920> which<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.060> released

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
locking system in here which is released

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.260 
locking system in here which is released
when<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.170> up<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.710> it's<00:02:27.580> locked<00:02:27.940> when<00:02:28.150> it's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
when it's up and it's locked when it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.740 
when it's up and it's locked when it's
down<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.410> locked<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.100> cannot<00:02:30.430> easily

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
down so if it's locked you cannot easily

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.050 
down so if it's locked you cannot easily
move<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.950> make<00:02:32.950> sure<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.490> it's<00:02:33.640> released

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
move in make sure that it's released

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.380 
move in make sure that it's released
before<00:02:34.450> moving<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:36.190> prevent<00:02:36.520> any<00:02:36.880> damage

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
before moving it to prevent any damage

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.090 
before moving it to prevent any damage
to<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> change<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:41.080> control<00:02:41.890> on

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
to the change and you have control on

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.610 
to the change and you have control on
the<00:02:42.370> angles<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.420> well<00:02:43.630> you've<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the angles as well you've got a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.000 
the angles as well you've got a
protractor<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.550> here<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.239> gives<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.260> 360

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
protractor in here it gives you 360

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.660

the<00:03:03.520> decree<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.270> your<00:03:04.510> ruler<00:03:05.470> sets<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.580> if<00:03:06.850> you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
the decree of your ruler sets so if you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.930 
the decree of your ruler sets so if you
keep<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.780> lever<00:03:08.380> down<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:09.459> move<00:03:09.730> it

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
keep this lever down and then move it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.020 
keep this lever down and then move it
and<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.540> release<00:03:11.020> that<00:03:11.350> one<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.670> just

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and just release that one it just

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.500 
and just release that one it just
changes<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.050> degrees<00:03:14.650> by<00:03:15.040> 15<00:03:15.820> degrees<00:03:15.850> each

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
changes the degrees by 15 degrees each

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.560 
changes the degrees by 15 degrees each
time<00:03:17.250> okay

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
time okay

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.370 
time okay
so<00:03:19.570> let's<00:03:20.500> say<00:03:20.739> we<00:03:21.160> need<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.610> 30<00:03:22.000> degrees<00:03:22.600> we

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
so let's say we need like 30 degrees we

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.430 
so let's say we need like 30 degrees we
put<00:03:23.590> first<00:03:24.220> degree<00:03:24.520> in<00:03:24.760> here<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.450> there<00:03:26.110> we<00:03:26.260> go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
put first degree in here and there we go

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.510 
put first degree in here and there we go
we've<00:03:26.980> got<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.430> set<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.540> your<00:03:29.230> drawing<00:03:29.620> rulers

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
we've got a set of your drawing rulers

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.610 
we've got a set of your drawing rulers
at<00:03:30.850> 30<00:03:31.330> degrees<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:34.060> can<00:03:34.239> also<00:03:34.450> use<00:03:35.320> different

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
at 30 degrees you can also use different

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.800 
at 30 degrees you can also use different
degrees<00:03:36.310> other<00:03:36.580> than<00:03:36.880> 15<00:03:37.630> 30<00:03:38.140> 45<00:03:38.550> or<00:03:39.550> 60<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.600> you

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
degrees other than 15 30 45 or 60 if you

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.199 
degrees other than 15 30 45 or 60 if you
like<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.320> lever<00:03:41.590> down<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.760> released<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
like this lever down it released the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.990 
like this lever down it released the
set<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.810> then<00:03:45.439> you've<00:03:45.650> got<00:03:45.890> another<00:03:46.099> control

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
set and then you've got another control

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.050 
set and then you've got another control
system<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.629> here<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.230> another<00:03:48.680> sort<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.700> lock

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
system in here in another sort of lock

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.530 
system in here in another sort of lock
system<00:03:50.629> for<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.980> can<00:03:52.189> set<00:03:52.909> like<00:03:53.180> let's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
system for and you can set like let's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.050 
system for and you can set like let's
say<00:03:54.219> seven<00:03:55.219> and<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.400> half<00:03:55.430> degrees<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:58.670> here

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
say seven and a half degrees up in here

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.899 
say seven and a half degrees up in here
and<00:03:59.299> then<00:03:59.900> like<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.319> system<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:00.980> then<00:04:01.609> you've

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
and then like the system and then you've

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.750 
and then like the system and then you've
got<00:04:02.180> your<00:04:02.420> set<00:04:02.780> rulers<00:04:03.260> set<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.219> seven<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:04.700> a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
got your set rulers set to seven and a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.809 
got your set rulers set to seven and a
half<00:04:04.790> degrees<00:04:05.540> against<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.639> horizontal<00:04:07.639> line

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
half degrees against a horizontal line

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.289 
half degrees against a horizontal line
and<00:04:08.150> then<00:04:09.049> once<00:04:09.859> it's<00:04:10.099> set<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.790> can<00:04:10.969> start

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
and then once it's set you can start

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.229 
and then once it's set you can start
drawing<00:04:11.569> using<00:04:12.109> your<00:04:12.560> ruler<00:04:13.239> horizontal

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
drawing using your ruler horizontal

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:24.840 
drawing using your ruler horizontal
ruler<00:04:14.599> and<00:04:14.930> vertical<00:04:15.680> ruler<00:04:16.570> thank<00:04:17.570> you
