and if that happens you meat might need

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
and if that happens you meat might need
to<00:01:15.840> restring<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.470> piano<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.549> an<00:01:17.670> older

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to restring your piano which on an older

upright even a trusted loved instrument

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
upright even a trusted loved instrument
you'd<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.119> twice<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.590> because

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you'd have to think twice about because

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
you'd have to think twice about because
the<00:01:22.710> cost<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.400> restringing<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.030> piano<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the cost of restringing a piano is you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.859 
the cost of restringing a piano is you
know<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:25.920> formidable<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.090> you'd<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
know pretty formidable and you'd have to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.440 
know pretty formidable and you'd have to
really<00:01:28.400> search<00:01:29.400> deep<00:01:29.670> within<00:01:29.850> yourself<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
really search deep within yourself to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.399 
really search deep within yourself to
see<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.780> something<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.049> wanted<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
see if it's something you wanted to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
see if it's something you wanted to
embark<00:01:31.799> upon<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> wouldn't<00:01:32.909> worry<00:01:33.000> about

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
embark upon but I wouldn't worry about

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
embark upon but I wouldn't worry about
one<00:01:33.450> broken<00:01:33.659> string<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.530> you're

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
one broken string at all I think you're

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.319
