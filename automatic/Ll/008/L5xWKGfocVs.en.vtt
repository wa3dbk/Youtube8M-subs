 find for the gee things to know 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.950
 on a mac donald's salad 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.000
 McDonald's is fatter than 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.740
 the whole emperor 800 for salad 710 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.430
 I told you whole hamburger I tell you 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.950
 tomatoes I tell you sauce I tell you 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.280
 cheese I tell you chopped steak and I'll tell you 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.640
 say of course which also puts to 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.590
 interior 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.170
 how is it called 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.310
 is called how pickles too here 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.630
 so it's still something 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.220
 of huge salad I do not know what they 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.420
 fuck in anyway we will not get 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.130
 lie it's true that the salad of magma 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.090
 nature was good and but I know 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.200
 really not what they do not care about 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 the salad what 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.180
 mcdonald's still remains a 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.500
 so well known restaurant is 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.420
 so much appreciated around the world 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.550
 that even the Queen of England has 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.140
 bought one at 116 million dollars 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.430
 so to tell you how old she is 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.530
 eat mcdonnell every night 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.940
 frankly lisabeth in these cases you 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.739
 should maybe but invited a little 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.479
 hamburger you see head to head ya no 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.729
 problem me you invite me direct gene I 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.799
 take the train directly grenoble 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.700
 london live I come right away 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.299
 right now 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.490
 you know that mcdonald's gr 75 million 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.900
 barrel per day 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.670
 it's still something huge 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.860
 but hey with thoune and mcdonald's who 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.780
 exists everyone knows mcdonald's 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 so I find that a little normal it is 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.140
 not something that surprises me in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.030
 any case personally so that's me 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.439
 even I did not even know it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.270
 but I thought mcdonald's 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.830
 was one of the biggest fast food or 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.900
 even the biggest restaurants in 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.610
 world's best known is which the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.369
 people were buying the most on which the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.689
 people ate the most at ben no they got 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 are smashed 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.549
 but they took a nudge 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.090
 by this sound it was a thing of phew 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.280
 scramble them simply 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.920
 shattered and now this noise and the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.810
 first is the number and I knew it 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.770
 not even me I was part of it 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.759
 not very long ago to people 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.350
 who did not know I can really that 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.820
 it was still national who was managing 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.320
 the market at its level but no they 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.119
 are shattered by subway is really 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.250
 it surprises me a little dark and I 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.049
 did not hear necessarily speak a lot 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.579
 next to mcdonald's anyway but 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.410
 really this tip and the at the mine and 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.740
 you know that mcdonald's in front of more than 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.480
 75 years burger per second 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.360
 there they have just resold 75 there 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 still 75 there again 75 and that's when 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 even a thing of whew but worth knowing that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.820
 mayonnade is a huge restaurant and 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.050
 cana really everywhere so inevitably 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.370
 when it's dark in France and the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.940
 sick are closed battle is not that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.080
 in japan in united states in india in 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.950
 australia are doing their 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.810
 figures you see what I say or not 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.490
 so it's still a restaurant in the world 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.320
 so that's why it would be a restaurant 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.340
 French at night sees the lured nothing 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.350
 there would be no more sales seeing that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.280
 it's a restaurant or world a world 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.170
 buddy you see what I mean or 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.330
 not necessarily but it is bought from 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.500
 everywhere so very good news for 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.510
 the big feignasses who do not like the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.890
 everything at the MC donald's bad of young people 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.840
 now makes deliveries to 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.400
 home with a good little yellow scooter 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.450
 with mcdonald's behind then 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.650
 do not worry now you can have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.870
 home deliveries 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 of course it's in 18 countries of the world 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.570
 for now and I know that the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.190
 delivery is possible in France already 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.480
 so I tell you like this after no 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.160
 necessarily in all cities not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.260
 necessarily all mac do but she is 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 already available in France normally 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.500
 so that's so one day you want a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.170
 mcdonald's and does not necessarily want to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.390
 take out hashtag take your fixed and then 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.210
 that's all so the Chinese got 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.630
 launched a new challenge open a 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.030
 mcdonald's one day yes you did well 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.010
 heard he opens a mcdonald's a day 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.600
 so of course we will find mcdonald's 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.110
 per day in a country where they are more 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.090
 one billion it can do it 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.680
 true a mcdonald's a day in France 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.720
 by contract would be something else there you this 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 rite in the shit in the shit shit 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.470
 shit , you're in shit 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.370
 a lot of hours a day in France I 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.170
 I'm sorry we're not numerous enough 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.730
 but the battle is not there they are 1 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.840
 billion you could open 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.800
 mcdonald's restaurants there is no 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.570
 problem 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.100
 mcdonald's at the time sells hot dogs 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.530
 which which means that at the time the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.820
 fillets with the burgers and 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.950
 all this bullshit there did not exist 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.510
 at all he was selling that smells that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.770
 odors that smells odors and 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.030
 finally maybe a little understood that he 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.130
 maybe we had to move on 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 and when I say something else not 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.010
 necessarily others one thing but other 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.090
 more numerous thing see as the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.860
 some we'll say hamburgers that make 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.990
 the effect of the cards several things 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.850
 here is really being pretty random and 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.810
 have a lot to offer and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.040
 second is something positive 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.900
 it's true that when you're in a 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.670
 restaurant and that you just offer or 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.280
 in a bar admit and you propose 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.540
 just vodka and coke that's not going well 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.740
 to be terrible scene activex request for 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.940
 the orangina students is not bah 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.530
 listen to lose a client 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.300
 while the more you propose below 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.220
 restaurant or in a bar elsewhere and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.460
 the better that's it then its cause the 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.770
 subjects really derailed and there are 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.510
 outright a museum one like the museum where 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.870
 you go to see the dinosaurs or the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.530
 men after O-rings yeah that's the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.750
 Big Mac 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.520
 so here you come in that the big mac that 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.420
 big mac stuff that friends of the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.920
 big mac posters 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.480
 the dates of can not be gbaka exit 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.190
 agree and big mac who got themselves 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.540
 to eat like less in success to do 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.590
 the recipe of big mac as much 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.200
 managed to find such and such thing 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.670
 had fun special big mac 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.830
 that's still something 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.720
 crazy but that's how it's life 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.860
 So here are the brothers and sisters 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.120
 was there simply for the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.250
 last and second thing 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.540
