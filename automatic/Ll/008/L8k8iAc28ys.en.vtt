00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.170
 first move here is a movement 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.579

 similar martinho well 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.180
 this is basically the movement of the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.670
 swimming here then there is no other hypothesis 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.790
 in another movement that has to see the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.070
 which occurs 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.070

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 much better fundamentals than the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.640
 movement had a delicious then the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.290
 next race when nobody 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.240

 pessimism it can assemble demand 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.970
