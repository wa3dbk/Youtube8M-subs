00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 you are a racket solo crusaders 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 Punish your opponent Katharina and you are

 witt radio maria truth exactly 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:14.240
 compensation yes that does not mean that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 directly in the endgame counter 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 example with lane cassette viktor so what 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.590
 comes on to have to watch quarterly 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 Read why a counter is directly 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810
 between here 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.140
 Katharina lte interrupted she wants to leave 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.990
 shampoo nolte idea of diana her katar 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 wants to glued colors in front of the football and 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.360
 Qatar I can score less sign 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.770
 brushed off now by diana yes that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.270
 was pretty much for Qatar but what's up 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.440
 There is also the counter page 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.680
 probably also the description 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.890
 I call it what you think exactly like that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.710
 martin champion looks weak against 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.130
 good against and good with wayne 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.360
 Of course there know perfectly catlin 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.790
 destroyed that is also kauders and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.640
 collector space chosen that's well is 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 standard armor lyrics though, something like that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.760
 yes it was quite often you can go in 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.620
 Using solo kyu usually helps second 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.330
 Most counter only used during 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.120
 however, playing well now can 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.760
 I am on top line what I am 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.410
 do not get corinne countess 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.209
 correct 0 then i will be able to york 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 but because of the contact with the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.370
 best players seem like you and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.910

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.150
 but otherwise, of course, contact me 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.330

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.660
