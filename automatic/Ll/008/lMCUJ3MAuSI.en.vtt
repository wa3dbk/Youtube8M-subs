 logo on your portal and multimedia magazine 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.559
 mechanic you follow one more 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.059
 stage of the best driver 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.110
 truck from Brazil promoted by 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.360
 left and alexandre 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.860
 now it's the turn of pernambuco that there 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.230
 tarcísio we are coming to our 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.710
 11th regional stage 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.449
 are 14 in all are about 1400 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.489
 participants who do not do all these 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.129
 maneuvers these tests that you were 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.620
 You can see there and they will be there. 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.050
 present to those 14 steps we took 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.339
 28 finalists that we take to são 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.219
 paulo to make the national grand final 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.170
 that you go between December 4th and 6th 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.720
 It's the number that looks small 28 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.910
 finalists 14 more steps of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.850
 description once again here in Brazil 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.610
 The enrollment fee is 1400 participants 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.649
 but we're talking in the universe 65 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.539
 thousand enrolled here in Brazil just to 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.440
 you have an idea the competition is 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.539
 world 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.200
 85,000 registered worldwide 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.910
 and only Brazil is 65 thousand participants 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.460
 then those 1,400 who are here with 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.280
 people participating in the 14 steps and 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.259
 passed two and two evidence 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 are arriving in the third phase, right? 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.700
 So it's tapering and we're going to take 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 28 for the big final in são paulo there the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 people ask what it is to be the best 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.860
 truck driver from brazil is very 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.540
 more than the loss of a truck 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.130
 have a social work one side a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.630
 side of training you offer 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.000
 Also here 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.799
 This is for sure the school always promotes 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.799
 She always cares very much about the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.320
 safety on the roads and the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.840
 economy then all these engines are 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.280
 here we are being trained 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.329
 they are undergoing several 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 speeches 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.530
 They are talking to the police. 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.299
 federal road with sest senat 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.680
 so it goes far beyond what it just drove 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.120
 a truck we have a concern 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.370
 very large in security in economy and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 these people there are the cream that will leave 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.630
 I really think the big differential 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.760
 the champion driver is to increase the competition 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.799
 like this but the others in 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.610
 several winners the team leaves during the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.260
 competition 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.629
 that sure 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.340
 several are several world champions 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.689
 that participates that much ends up 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.159
 gaining training right? 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.870
 but nowadays just the fact that you are 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.060
 truck driver you are already a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.180
 champion and you 're already a hero to face 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.489
 all these roads is a problem 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 of infrastructure with a hole with 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.180
 accident really only the fact that you 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 being on the road where you are already a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.739
 champion is what we do here is just 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.569
 encourage more and more to encourage this 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.379
 which is so important for the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.849
 parents 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.709
 what is interesting you seek to know 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.569
 The best other problem in Brazil is that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.650
 here it is better to have to hit 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.840
 our children 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 this really has to show and 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.230
 have to show is good ability to 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.629
 maneuver 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.639
 the issue is not even there beating him 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.049
 yes you have to knock the pin but with all 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.940
 care and with all possible precision 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.370
 because in day to day he is maneuvering 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.510
 he is putting the truck in places 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.370
 tight 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.530
 he has to say attach the implement 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.060
 You have to put the implement so more 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.400
 than he overthrow the pin is the question 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.620
 accuracy in this test 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.430
 paulo the novel once again receiving the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.299
 competition is we are here jaboatão 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.160
 already by the third consecutive edition 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.930
 playing the best driver for us 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.510
 this event is very important because 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.299
 because it has a number of advantages in 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.049
 terms of bringing the driver for a 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.389
 side of truck productivity 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.940
 the most important thing is usually spoken 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.560
 which is the best driver's competition is 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.599
 the one who runs the one who does the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.129
 faster curve but it 's nothing like that 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.650
 our best driver is the one who 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.410
 can do the work with the minor 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.180
 possible cost within this 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.699
 competition in action by bringing the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.949
 inside the dealership and 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.720
 training are then also having 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.069
 it's not just competition so leading 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.560
 information for him 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.959
 and in that year a novelty is the award 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.870
 the youngest driver also the youngest 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.150
 35 years because the intention is to bring 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.699
 It's also more professional and more people. 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.800
 for this career of promoters because 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.229
 the stage with a very large disability 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.970
 then noise in a way to motivate 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.409
 Children of families are reunited 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.820
 This child who is here today who 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.750
 You know tomorrow, it's going to be the driver. 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.690
 give back 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.890
 already bruce side of economy security 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.720
 productivity 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.760
 this competition that happens in the world 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.770
 all the new world the Brazil section more 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.000
 once beating the record is the best she 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.520
 happens here in the northeast as well. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.670
 mainly in pernambuco already has a 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.400
 The idea of the size of this is 85 thousand 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.130
 inscriptions of the world in brazil were 65 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.860
 Then it's Brazil, it takes a lot of weight. 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.020
 big and ea every year that goes by every 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.270
 each event that passes every two years 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.280
 more people participating I have during 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.900
 the year engines look for me to know when it is 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.540
 which starts enrolling the smaller engines 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.070
 are motivated to come and participate 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.020
 competing then it's very cool, well 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.400
 interesting what is really cool is 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.170
 very interesting the best competition 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.700
 truck driver that pernambuco is 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.260
 hot ground is hot foot 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.120
 We already won as a press already 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.950
 we took a national champion and who knows 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.520
 This time it's hot again, who? 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.560
 we have great chance to aaa quality the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.610
 motors are participating in the performance 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.950
 his is very good 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.730
 We do not believe that they will participate 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.730
 compete there to win 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.530
 in conversation with the stage champion 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.180
 Pernambuco jaboatão of the guararapes 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.560
 first champion are two champions I 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.419
 I talk to gilson cardoso 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.449
 gilson how was yesterday's test was the 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.940
 differential looks at me the proof and left 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.970
 to the street when wonderful is the 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.550
 recognition that we have a flair 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.479
 the concessionaire of those who recognize the 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.539
 the truck driver's work in little 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.910
 determined but we have a place 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.949
 since it is known as the 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.800
 trucker and this is very good it 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:20.430
 lifted the astral encourage world 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.520
 He understood well my son wants to be there 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.169
 truck driver understood and she will 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.910
 encouraging people more and more 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:33.210
 there further improve the profession and improve 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.220
 on the road there the guy looks like the 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.270
 We have people here from the highway police. 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.330
 federal 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.699
 it is innate sense to improve the 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.159
 road performance regarding law 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.380
 what we are going to find 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:48.630
 person to person with the incentive to 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.090
 person to seek more and more to practice 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.580
 best on the safety road of 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.080
 transport everything there you talked about how 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.389
 It's the competition but it did not tell me. 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.009
 told to differentiate there in the test yesterday that 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.740
 decided to be the first 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.110
 and such a directly favorite favorite there 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.930
 for big end 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:13.670
 the differential there I do not know or explain 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:16.160
 without expressing more 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.280
 the differential so the girl what we people 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.790
 You should always feel the first 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.830
 this is very good is very tasty to 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.830
 people think it's better
