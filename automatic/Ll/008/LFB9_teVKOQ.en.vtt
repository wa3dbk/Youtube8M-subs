um but we've been busy you know but in
the<00:05:19.810> strategy<00:05:20.110> we<00:05:20.290> had<00:05:20.410> today<00:05:20.560> was<00:05:20.980> really

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
the strategy we had today was really

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.000 
the strategy we had today was really
simple<00:05:21.850> but<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.570> works<00:05:22.840> because<00:05:23.230> it<00:05:23.860> hasn't

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
simple but it works because it hasn't
