 in 1816 and they painted him in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 in 1850 it took almost 40 years for the artist to interest the qaeda but 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.800
 So what did the artists paint at the time of independence? 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.449

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.449

 Jack 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.530

 what the hell this silverio will mean each raffle is the material lotus 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.040
 question to be solved nonetheless I refer to that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.360
 jajaja de jaén 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.680

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.460
 independence this is a mission for the teacher has overcome 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 nothing alcalá to reach this collective 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.200
 We have been investigating the process at a press conference. We found that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 Pablo Caballero All the most important dates of that time of Santa Fe 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.740
 where he made portraits 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.780
 in 1806 painter josé manuel garat in the house of his family then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.710
 but who was this Mr. Jose Manuel Martinez outstanding Colombian writer 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.580
 of the 19th century Peronist poets poets died at 78 in 1878 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.680
 it was so high 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.170
 has taken advantage to find new cut roads have marked help for 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.960
 close the wounds of the past 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 within this commitment to the sector 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.080
 they have also contributed 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.700
 Tomorrow will take part of the heavy burden a mortal sin the doctor of the knot 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.260
 day 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.150
 if the comparison of this good man 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.170
 it was our fault his stumble excuse sir jesus the painter percent said 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.519
 that these are planned, the director of celcit spoke before Italy 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.689
 the prettiest of the virginite dress and the bold one the gift once many 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:45.809
 Thank my Lord 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.140
 Here we are all 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.959
 the house pablo caballero 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
 clear clear where I was going 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.030
 need help yes thank you very much 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.080
 almost all of us who dedicate ourselves to this should have at least one assistant 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.000
 to charge everything if I go home with your partner not here in the new grenade 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.420
 Our work is not very well valued 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.399
 although the thing has improved in recent times 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.399
 Hurry - I had a miniature that makes 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.279
 p 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.860
 It has already passed said 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.760
 but so that Pablo must pappa to another 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.790
 the disc was proved that in the previous colonial stage even long before the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.730
 Independence with painting ideas on religious themes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.319
 yes the images were of holy angels victimhood and more of the bible 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.020
 and they put them in the convents and other churches and this was a 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.790
 key strategy of the church 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.770
 to reinforce the faith of the people 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.080
 but there is something that does not fit children here we are seeing something else 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.469
 let's ask what make it up stay still boy 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.389
 and it is that painting or religious has gone out of fashion or because it is drawing 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.019
 would do 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.379
 not how it occurs to him what happens is that 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.569
 since the last century and other things began to be painted to the viceroys 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.909
 archbishops and those who believe very important that he gave to paint 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.069
 rather to all those who had the money yes 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.680
 not now the fashion is that the wealthiest 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.540
 it's about making domínguez paintings durán small portraits to decorate 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.729
 home 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.420
 I have been very good with Pablo 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.650
 I deeply admire his physical role with all modesty the strategist 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.150
 I have a similar project in the preparation of the shrimp ceviche with 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.940
 chipi Chipi 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.120
 it's all a work of art and some other race 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.560
 the hand to the event 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.800
 his is very weak 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 let's say we are abstract or firm bullshit 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.849
 the contrary the most interesting data pablo caballero also participated in 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.260
 the botanical expedition painting the plants that the researchers 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.819
 find and catalog 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.569
 so what also helped the selection well the process 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.569
 and with this plate ends in investigation 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.580
 that's why the conclusions 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.729
 that many of the works of art that we associate with independence 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.409
 they were made later because we know that at that time the painting was in charge of 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.370
 church most of the paintings had religious themes and that's why 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.409
 tomorrow he loses that the people who with the archbishops like 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.809
 maple cache doing the final stretch and two years later that custom of 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.139
 Creole flights more aligned and they even began to paint a portrait of the 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.429
 peace in the country to know besides nadal 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:29.719
 in the parliament to order to kill we have met curiously little sports 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.789
 like the art of the criollos but as it was the art of the natives and blacks 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.039
 the consultations and the battle were painted so much later in that sense 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.169
 it is already the fifth economy but the things and who decided that it will be painted and 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:42.860
 who does not 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.879
 for a series an excellent research was asked 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.150
 this is a victory for the personal agreement exceeded 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.250
 for more information entity that this worker colombia learns a point of a 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:58.960
 coke point without frightening there's no
