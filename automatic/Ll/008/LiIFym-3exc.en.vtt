guy<00:04:12.079> but<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.109> guess<00:04:13.439> it's<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.769> good<00:04:13.980> plus<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.519> you

hit the girl nothing happens like no

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.110 
hit the girl nothing happens like no
percent<00:04:19.919> or<00:04:20.190> anything<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:25.250> love<00:04:26.250> using<00:04:26.550> bonsly

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
percent or anything I love using bonsly

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.860 
percent or anything I love using bonsly
like<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.570> just<00:04:28.199> thrown<00:04:29.030> nobody<00:04:30.030> cares<00:04:35.870> if

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
like that just thrown nobody cares if

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.920 
like that just thrown nobody cares if
you<00:04:37.139> see<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.919> hit<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.030> ice<00:04:39.210> climber<00:04:39.630> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
you see that it hit the ice climber and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.260 
you see that it hit the ice climber and
I<00:04:40.020> guess<00:04:40.260> heap<00:04:40.530> meteor<00:04:41.130> smashed<00:04:41.490> down<00:04:41.760> because

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
I guess heap meteor smashed down because

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.870 
I guess heap meteor smashed down because
of<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.820> makes<00:04:45.180> me<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.510> champion

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
of that and that makes me the champion

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.550 
of that and that makes me the champion
so<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:48.770> guess<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.370> end<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:50.849> video

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
so I guess this is the end of the video

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.830 
so I guess this is the end of the video
so<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.919> always<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.820> is<00:04:54.000> be<00:04:54.330> sonic<00:04:54.900> sanic<00:04:55.610> 64

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
so as always this is be sonic sanic 64

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:08.130 
so as always this is be sonic sanic 64
