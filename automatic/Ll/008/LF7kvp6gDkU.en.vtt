I use under here is glimmer mist method
that<00:02:42.629> glimmer<00:02:43.260> mist<00:02:43.530> method<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.430> learned

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
that glimmer mist method that I learned

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.550 
that glimmer mist method that I learned
from<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.239> technique<00:02:45.660> from<00:02:45.900> rach<00:02:47.720> 0113<00:02:48.720> she's<00:02:49.410> an

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
from a technique from rach 0113 she's an

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.589 
from a technique from rach 0113 she's an
absolutely<00:02:50.069> brilliant<00:02:50.400> artist<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.239> really

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
absolutely brilliant artist and I really

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.130 
absolutely brilliant artist and I really
I<00:02:51.780> saw<00:02:52.709> her<00:02:52.980> do<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:54.030> technique<00:02:54.599> with<00:02:54.900> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I saw her do that technique with the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.399 
I saw her do that technique with the
glimmer<00:02:55.470> mist<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.599> used<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.170> all

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409

fibers<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.180> got<00:04:17.360> from<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.720> fiber<00:04:18.050> swamp

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
fibers that I got from this fiber swamp

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.540 
fibers that I got from this fiber swamp
from<00:04:18.860> the<00:04:19.160> from<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.850> beach<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.140> back

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
of that tag and here is another tag

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.220 
of that tag and here is another tag
again<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.900> use<00:04:27.230> that<00:04:27.260> same<00:04:27.770> method<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:30.020> is

got from the fiber swap and this again
is<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.770> same<00:05:22.280> technique<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:24.050> Rach<00:05:24.800> 0113

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
is that same technique that Rach 0113

roses<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:38.090> made<00:05:38.330> with<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.570> little<00:05:38.960> different

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
roses I made with a little different

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.330 
roses I made with a little different
this<00:05:40.100> was<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.340> sizzix<00:05:41.170> rose<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.650> it<00:05:43.130> actually

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
this was a sizzix rose and it actually

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.250 
this was a sizzix rose and it actually
as<00:05:43.700> a<00:05:43.730> center<00:05:44.210> cut<00:05:44.480> out<00:05:44.660> which<00:05:44.930> works

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
as a center cut out which works

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.980 
as a center cut out which works
perfectly<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.370> don't<00:05:47.240> know<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.570> can<00:05:47.660> show

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
perfectly I don't know that I can show

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.990 
perfectly I don't know that I can show
you<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.230> civics<00:05:48.650> died<00:05:48.890> just<00:05:49.190> offhand<00:05:49.400> let<00:05:49.910> me

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
you that civics died just offhand let me

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.700 
you that civics died just offhand let me
see<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.270> I<00:05:50.330> can<00:05:50.480> find<00:05:50.690> it<00:05:50.840> real<00:05:51.080> quickly<00:05:51.470> here

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
see if I can find it real quickly here

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.030 
see if I can find it real quickly here
because<00:05:52.600> it's<00:05:53.600> got<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.990> center<00:05:54.350> cut<00:05:54.590> out<00:05:54.770> and

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
because it's got the center cut out and

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.030 
because it's got the center cut out and
it<00:05:55.130> works<00:05:55.370> really<00:05:55.790> really<00:05:56.120> great<00:05:56.830> for<00:05:57.830> this

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
it works really really great for this

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.500 
it works really really great for this
particular<00:06:00.250> nope<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.400> can't<00:06:01.760> find<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.180> just

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
particular nope I can't find it just

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.450 
particular nope I can't find it just
offhand<00:06:02.720> but<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:04.430> works<00:06:04.640> really<00:06:04.910> really<00:06:05.180> well

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
offhand but it works really really well

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.900 
offhand but it works really really well
for<00:06:07.460> that<00:06:08.420> kind<00:06:08.750> of<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.960> rose<00:06:09.490> Curtis<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.730> did

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
for that kind of a rose Curtis I did

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.550 
for that kind of a rose Curtis I did
find<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.380> it's<00:06:12.380> this

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
find it it's this

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.510 
find it it's this
sizzix<00:06:14.340> die<00:06:14.580> right<00:06:15.030> here<00:06:15.060> this<00:06:15.540> one<00:06:15.780> and

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
sizzix die right here this one and

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.430 
sizzix die right here this one and
that's<00:06:17.520> what<00:06:17.730> I<00:06:17.850> use<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.090> make<00:06:18.510> this<00:06:18.780> size<00:06:19.080> rose

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
that's what I use to make this size rose

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.520 
that's what I use to make this size rose
and<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.610> smaller<00:06:21.030> roses<00:06:21.630> i<00:06:21.660> use<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.260> paper

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
and the smaller roses i use this paper

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.310 
and the smaller roses i use this paper

journaling and this is actually the
first<00:07:09.570> one<00:07:10.169> where<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:10.410> use<00:07:10.710> that<00:07:11.070> technique<00:07:11.610> and
