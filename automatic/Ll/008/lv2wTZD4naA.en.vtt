known<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.620> NASA<00:01:40.770> program<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> can

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
known as the NASA program so you can

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
known as the NASA program so you can
gauge<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.240> importance<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> mission<00:01:43.410> from

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
gauge the importance of the mission from

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
gauge the importance of the mission from
that<00:01:46.070> flak<00:01:47.070> tower<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.970> modeled<00:01:48.240> on

the real flight tower that was

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.290 
the real flight tower that was

no<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> local<00:01:52.650> was<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> zoo<00:01:52.980> bunker<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:54.360> set

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
no to the local was a zoo bunker we set

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
no to the local was a zoo bunker we set
off<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> researched<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.400> were<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.580> actual

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
off and researched what were the actual

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 
off and researched what were the actual
dimensions<00:01:57.390> what<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.020> construction<00:01:58.430> how

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
dimensions what was the construction how

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
dimensions what was the construction how
thick<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.760> walls<00:01:59.970> were<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.690> we<00:02:00.870> began

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
thick the walls were and we we began

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
thick the walls were and we we began
building<00:02:01.260> our<00:02:01.530> own<00:02:01.560> factor<00:02:02.340> model<00:02:02.760> so<00:02:03.390> we

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
building our own factor model so we

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
building our own factor model so we
start<00:02:03.900> off<00:02:03.990> building<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:04.470> level<00:02:04.740> by<00:02:04.950> just

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
start off building a level by just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580 
start off building a level by just
literally<00:02:06.300> drawing<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.690> top-down<00:02:07.050> map<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
literally drawing a top-down map and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.980 
literally drawing a top-down map and
figure<00:02:07.830> out<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.640> everything<00:02:08.760> is<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.600> what

the proportions are from there we build

everything's laid out then we hand it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
wherever we can so in this level there's

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.150 
wherever we can so in this level there's
a<00:02:41.880> lot<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.150> destruction<00:02:42.480> going<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.320> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
a lot of destruction going on and it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680 
a lot of destruction going on and it
actually<00:02:44.310> makes<00:02:44.610> our<00:02:44.790> life<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.209> artists<00:02:45.630> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
whole lot more difficult to do this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.949 
whole lot more difficult to do this

making damaged and destroyed buildings

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.449 
making damaged and destroyed buildings
takes<00:02:49.320> about<00:02:49.440> three<00:02:49.770> times<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.100> much<00:02:50.250> effort

takes about three times as much effort

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
making the level believable is that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.500 
making the level believable is that
we've<00:02:55.680> included<00:02:55.980> propaganda<00:02:56.820> posters<00:02:57.270> both
