00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.250
 Today is Susaki Animal Hospital where it is this time 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.260
 I would like to answer the questions given to the audience 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.580
 Mr. Hara who is a pseudonym here 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:30.550
 The disease is 4 because of the kind of cats 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.810
 Yes it is a guy say in cervical religion's neck Region 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 So 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.190
 When I lost a leaf 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:46.480
 It is said that it would be better to take tartar 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.480
 It is to say to say or is said that there will not be as much as take tartar 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.580
 Well there 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.050
 Well, it seems that general anesthesia is uneasy at first taking 4th century 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.320
 that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.980
 Well of course 100% safe insect 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.610
 There is no surgery 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:13.490
 Well then 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:15.350
 Or more and more pathogens was allowed to take the tartar that is good to Tteyuu will spread throughout the body 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.740
 Kana is not it better was Tsu Cho I say 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 First of all is one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.080
 That 's a child of Cree Chun 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:33.060
 I come to my house 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:39.840
 That 's a disease that leaves have to stay. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.670
 Since Hey it mechanism is that what happens can not you talk of another such a short period of time 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.500
 Well importantly 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.720
 There are cells that make and break 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 In something of a reason I'd have become to some extent looks practice of Tteyuu 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.400
 It is Chat suppression Bakaka' activity of the cells that make the tooth 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.909
 High pressure cells alone there 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.350
 It is not a minute to melt from the inside 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.090
 It is thing called 4th 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 Then when I said what the cause is that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.920
 very well 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.030
 That there is a pathogen 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 If you pull it out, there really is that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:22.310
 It transmitted came the progress of when I melted rapidly 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:29.420
 Of you I do not know whether it is a child who was cut into one the children of until now is Well of course other children 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:35.720
 It seems that you are at a standstill to talk only with the children coming to you, so with that mark trunk 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.110
 A cell that creates tension in the body and loses control of the autonomic nervous system 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.260
 And forus cells 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.080
 I wonder go melts tooth happening is an imbalance of activity 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.080
 That's why I think so 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.390
 Of course it is important to take tartar though 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.650
 Ask me to find out what's going to be like this and pull it out 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.980
 The person who got 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.069
 this 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.490
 I think that the neck region may be useful in the sense of preventing recurrence 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:10.460
 First of all 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.200
 Of course the tartar removal, but if the cause remains even if it takes six tartar , the same thing will be done again 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:21.340
 Because is why occur 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:23.860
 If you can think of eliminating the cause together, maybe this problem should be solved 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.190
 It will also live in the exquisite 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:34.670
 Representative like it says anyway stubborn disease 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:39.400
 It feels like one, but it usually says that it seems to settle down after the cause 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.760
 Please take a moment to know that some veterinarians are saying 10 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.640
 It means that you are the teacher of your own by all means 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.420
 We recommend that you find out the cause and get it out 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.420
 I will
