00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello people we make basil today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 So pesto in principle with classic 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 pesto genovese only differences you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.500
 do not have pine nuts we take 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 sunflower seeds 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.230
 Personally, I even prefer it and it 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.230
 also moves the purse 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.170
 First you save the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.270
 sunflower seeds or old pine nuts 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.920
 her the what you may I also 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.820
 I pointed out have now been there 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.560
 simply dry pan pile of money 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.320
 start up and let it rust slowly 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.390
 again and again the said there are 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.110
 yes many pesto videos hidden from me 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.480
 since even purely 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.270
 I say then again okay what 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.290
 Garlic comes naturally too 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 amount of basil 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.489
 this is now an Egyptian ostrich 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.470
 basil made the really quite yes 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:04.480
 superhero parmesan salt pepper and a 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.840
 sensible olive sooner rather 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.740
 contemplative from the leaves and give 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.510
 Just add them to the blender vita mix 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.730
 moerser it really just exists 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 Many devices can make out completely 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.850
 no matter 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 a little head I let that part 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.150
 okay to cut garlic there too 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 a little rough before that is easy 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.040
 On device like that works better 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.040
 is something is made small 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.150
 maybe a bit much garlic 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.370
 same applies to salt according to gusto and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.770
 Pepper always fresh 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 ground pepper on black is ob 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.830
 it's more colorful it just tastes better 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.460
 tune now comes first, the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.460
 olive oil in too 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 The exact recipe in the altar infobox 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:30.420
 a link to the homepage on it and once 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 attacks 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.909
 as super fast as you can see 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.720
 Now come the roasted pine nuts 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.720
 or sunflower seeds added 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.140
 strike again 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.069
 That's enough, I think they taste good 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.780
 Much better if not quite 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.189
 are beaten when they are very pale 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.760
 that is also true for 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.439
 pine nuts then do not taste sweetish 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.200
 my taste easy to say 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:35.510
 it stays that way only when we are parmesan 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.409
 I can also cut small pieces 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.950
 or just over the kitchen roll 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.950
 to hunt 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.450
 I already had a bit of something 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 shown us 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.069
 in principle, he binds the mass only vegan 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.489
 of course wants to do without parmesan 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:09.180
 the risk share or lausanne shared 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:13.190
 Two rides share a damage 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.190
 in the device a bit more difficult 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 move 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.630
 and finished is a super delicious pastor 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:47.250
 a little bit super delicious 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.230
 fujitsu potatoes added to over a 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.540
 every technical filter is pure and clean 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.280
 below is our festo playlist 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.170
 clicks you but by happy times times completely 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.710
 a lot of rucola pesto and tomato paste 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.800
 in it 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.200
 we have korean or pesto in it 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.890
 best is so diverse is worth it 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.890
 really look at it
