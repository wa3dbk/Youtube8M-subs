00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
sometimes can be genuinely truthful and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
sometimes can be genuinely truthful and
speak<00:02:10.799> about<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> situation<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.880> kind<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
speak about the situation and kind of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240 
speak about the situation and kind of
guide<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.569> conversation<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.890> something

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
guide that conversation and something

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.130 
guide that conversation and something
some<00:02:14.519> passes<00:02:14.879> we're<00:02:15.569> just<00:02:15.750> trying<00:02:16.049> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
some passes we're just trying to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.360 
some passes we're just trying to
disconnect<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.709> hopefully<00:02:17.069> hope<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
disconnect and hopefully hope the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.910 
disconnect and hopefully hope the
conversation<00:02:17.819> will<00:02:17.910> go<00:02:18.030> away<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.569> won't

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
conversation will go away but it won't

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
conversation will go away but it won't
so<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.190> better<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.670> they<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.239> help

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so it's better that they can help

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.089 
so it's better that they can help
address<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.260> give<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.530> truth<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
address that and give some truth to the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.069 
address that and give some truth to the
situation<00:02:23.700> otherwise<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.690> internet<00:02:24.989> will

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
situation otherwise the internet will

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.720 
situation otherwise the internet will
create<00:02:25.319> its<00:02:25.440> own<00:02:25.560> truth<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.400> don't<00:02:26.579> want

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
create its own truth and you don't want

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.790 
create its own truth and you don't want
that
