hi welcome to cats bit productions to
color<00:00:05.540> print<00:00:06.980> demonstration<00:00:08.719> today<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.960> will

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
color print demonstration today I will

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.839 
color print demonstration today I will
demonstrate<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.400> very<00:00:12.059> simple<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.929> color<00:00:13.200> print

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
demonstrate a very simple to color print

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.680 
demonstrate a very simple to color print
with<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> flash<00:00:15.240> gear<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.100> we'll<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.400> doing

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
with a flash gear so what we'll be doing

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.859 
with a flash gear so what we'll be doing
is<00:00:18.690> we'll<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.930> printing<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.949> first<00:00:20.189> color

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
is we'll be printing the first color

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
is we'll be printing the first color
then<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.170> flash<00:00:22.380> cure<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.060> we

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
then we will flash cure it and then we

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
then we will flash cure it and then we
will<00:00:24.420> print<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.019> second<00:00:25.410> color<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.269> we're

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
will print the second color and we're

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.490 
will print the second color and we're
gonna<00:00:27.359> show<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.990> done

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
gonna show you how that's done

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.970 
gonna show you how that's done
okay<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.300> thing<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.859> get

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
okay so the first thing to do is to get

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.150 
okay so the first thing to do is to get
your<00:00:32.130> shirt<00:00:32.660> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.230> palette<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.980> some

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
your shirt on the palette with some

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.270 
your shirt on the palette with some
adhesive<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> spray<00:00:38.040> adhesive<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.290> made<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
adhesive this spray adhesive is made to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
adhesive this spray adhesive is made to
hold<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> shirt<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> pallet<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> keep

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
hold the shirt to the pallet and keep

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.690 
hold the shirt to the pallet and keep
the<00:00:44.340> shirt<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:44.850> moving<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.539> between<00:00:46.700> prints

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the shirt from moving in between prints

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
the shirt from moving in between prints
so<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.930> means<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> adhesive

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so what that means is that the adhesive

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
so what that means is that the adhesive
will<00:00:53.370> keep<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> shirt<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.879> same

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
will keep the shirt in this same

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
will keep the shirt in this same
position<00:00:58.579> as<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> first<00:01:02.370> print

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
position as I go from the first print

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
position as I go from the first print
and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.300> pulled<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.930> screen<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> wants

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and I pulled the screen up and it wants

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.740 
and I pulled the screen up and it wants
to<00:01:05.189> pull<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.610> bit<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> shirt<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to pull a little bit of the shirt up the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
to pull a little bit of the shirt up the
adhesive<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.350> keep<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.740> tight<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
adhesive will keep it tight down to the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
adhesive will keep it tight down to the
pallet<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.110> prevent<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.409> registration

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
pallet and prevent any registration

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.450 
pallet and prevent any registration
problems<00:01:12.890> okay<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.689> our<00:01:15.720> shirt<00:01:16.020> down

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
problems okay so we have our shirt down

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:36.520 
problems okay so we have our shirt down
so<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.759> ahead<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.350> print<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.009> first<00:01:20.220> color

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.200 

there's<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.310> first<00:01:37.490> color<00:01:37.820> on<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.180> shirt

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
there's the first color on the shirt

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
there's the first color on the shirt
it's<00:01:41.210> wet<00:01:41.510> at<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.930> point<00:01:42.260> if<00:01:42.980> we<00:01:43.010> were<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.550> go

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's wet at this point if we were to go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.250 
it's wet at this point if we were to go
ahead<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.090> print<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.420> second<00:01:44.780> color<00:01:44.990> now

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
ahead and print the second color now

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.070 
ahead and print the second color now
what<00:01:46.010> would<00:01:46.160> happen<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.870> portion<00:01:47.870> of<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
what would happen is a portion of the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.510 
what would happen is a portion of the
ink<00:01:48.260> that's<00:01:48.440> already<00:01:48.650> laid<00:01:48.890> down<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.370> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
ink that's already laid down on the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.880 
ink that's already laid down on the
shirt<00:01:49.760> would<00:01:50.330> pick<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.410> back<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.620> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
shirt would pick up on the back of the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.000 
shirt would pick up on the back of the
next<00:01:52.190> color<00:01:52.430> screen<00:01:53.200> therefore<00:01:54.200> reducing<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
next color screen therefore reducing the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.380 
next color screen therefore reducing the
amount<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.370> ink<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.820> you've<00:01:55.970> already<00:01:56.210> put

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
amount of ink that you've already put

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.040 
amount of ink that you've already put
down<00:01:56.780> here<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.980> will<00:01:58.220> also<00:01:58.520> cause<00:01:59.270> your

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
down here it will also cause your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.010 
down here it will also cause your
resolution<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.890> become<00:02:01.400> more<00:02:01.730> blurry<00:02:02.090> now

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
resolution to become more blurry now

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.480 
resolution to become more blurry now
there<00:02:03.230> are<00:02:03.320> different<00:02:03.680> types<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.160> printing

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
there are different types of printing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.889 
there are different types of printing
methods<00:02:06.250> some<00:02:07.250> people<00:02:07.640> like<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.240> flash<00:02:08.570> all

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
methods some people like to flash all

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.230 
methods some people like to flash all
their<00:02:09.080> colors<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.619> between<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.180> said

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
their colors in between and like I said

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.780 
their colors in between and like I said
that<00:02:11.420> gives<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.930> increased<00:02:12.260> resolution<00:02:13.010> but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that gives you increased resolution but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.410 
that gives you increased resolution but
other<00:02:13.940> people<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.990> print<00:02:15.260> wet<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.420> what

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
other people like to print wet and what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.360 
other people like to print wet and what
that<00:02:17.600> does<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.200> speeds<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.010> printing

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that does is it speeds up the printing

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.120 
that does is it speeds up the printing
process<00:02:19.940> quite<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.600> bit<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.950> would

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
process quite a bit so that we would

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.740 
process quite a bit so that we would
print<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.550> color<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.090> then<00:02:23.450> all<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
print this color and then all the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.540 
print this color and then all the
subsequent<00:02:24.140> colors<00:02:24.650> down<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.070> top<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.459> this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
subsequent colors down on top of this

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.170 
subsequent colors down on top of this
would<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.820> printed<00:02:26.300> wet<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.790> we'll<00:02:28.790> get<00:02:28.970> more

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
would be printed wet and we'll get more

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.550 
would be printed wet and we'll get more
into<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.990> future

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
into that in the future

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.830 
into that in the future
okay<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.610> let's<00:02:31.820> go<00:02:31.970> ahead<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.270> flash<00:02:32.510> cure

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
okay but let's go ahead and flash cure

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.870 
okay but let's go ahead and flash cure
this<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.620> pull<00:02:33.830> our<00:02:33.950> flash<00:02:34.220> curing<00:02:34.700> unit

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
this so we pull our flash curing unit

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
this so we pull our flash curing unit
over<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:36.550> we're<00:02:37.550> gonna<00:02:37.670> flash<00:02:37.970> cure<00:02:38.300> this

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
over and we're gonna flash cure this

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.479 
over and we're gonna flash cure this
this<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.780> said<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.200> flash<00:02:42.680> curing<00:02:43.220> unit

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
this is like I said a flash curing unit

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.190 
this is like I said a flash curing unit
all<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.200> big<00:02:45.910> square<00:02:46.910> infrared<00:02:47.720> panel

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
all it is is a big square infrared panel

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.820 
all it is is a big square infrared panel
that<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.190> emitting<00:02:50.060> Heat<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:51.680> we're

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
that is emitting Heat and what we're

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.620 
that is emitting Heat and what we're
doing<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.850> same<00:02:53.060> thing<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.390> would

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
doing here is the same thing that would

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.530 
doing here is the same thing that would
be<00:02:53.780> done<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> curing<00:02:54.650> dryer<00:02:54.950> except<00:02:55.910> not

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
be done in the curing dryer except not

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.470 
be done in the curing dryer except not
all<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.260> way<00:02:57.410> we're<00:02:58.250> only<00:02:58.400> trying<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:59.030> get<00:02:59.300> it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
all the way we're only trying to get it

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.930 
all the way we're only trying to get it
to<00:02:59.630> cure<00:03:00.019> just<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.980> touch<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.790> when

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
to cure just to the touch so that when

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.570 
to cure just to the touch so that when
you<00:03:02.060> touch<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.360> there's<00:03:03.260> no<00:03:03.530> ink<00:03:03.830> coming<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.400> on

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
you touch it there's no ink coming up on

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.949 
you touch it there's no ink coming up on
your<00:03:05.330> finger<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.010> let<00:03:07.130> me<00:03:07.280> add<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.750> can

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
your finger and let me add that you can

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.800 
your finger and let me add that you can
do<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.320> kind<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.650> touching<00:03:10.070> test<00:03:10.400> as<00:03:10.700> long<00:03:11.570> as

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
do this kind of touching test as long as

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.440 
do this kind of touching test as long as
you<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.739> bring<00:03:12.950> your<00:03:13.130> finger<00:03:13.459> down<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.940> the

you you bring your finger down on the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.410 
you you bring your finger down on the
print<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:14.959> directly<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:16.090> directly<00:03:17.090> down

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
print and directly up directly down

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.199 
print and directly up directly down
directly<00:03:18.110> up<00:03:18.440> okay<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.430> then<00:03:19.610> even<00:03:19.940> if<00:03:20.060> it's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
directly up okay and then even if it's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.630 
directly up okay and then even if it's
wet<00:03:20.510> you're<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.440> gonna<00:03:21.590> ruin<00:03:21.830> your<00:03:22.100> print<00:03:22.400> if

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
wet you're not gonna ruin your print if

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.560 
wet you're not gonna ruin your print if
you<00:03:23.209> do<00:03:23.630> your<00:03:23.840> test<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> slide<00:03:26.420> it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
you do your test like this and slide it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.240 
you do your test like this and slide it
you're<00:03:26.660> gonna<00:03:26.780> smudge<00:03:27.110> your<00:03:27.260> print<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.769> what

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
you're gonna smudge your print so what

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.490 
you're gonna smudge your print so what
you<00:03:28.340> do<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.640> directly<00:03:29.060> down<00:03:29.360> directly<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:30.230> and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
you do is directly down directly up and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.289 
you do is directly down directly up and
you<00:03:30.860> look<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.100> see<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.489> there's<00:03:31.670> any<00:03:31.820> ink<00:03:32.120> on

your finger there's no ink on my finger
okay<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.120> basically<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.320> flash<00:03:36.530> caring

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
okay so basically the flash caring

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.000 
okay so basically the flash caring
portion<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.880> done<00:03:38.390> also<00:03:39.380> keep<00:03:39.860> in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
portion of this is done also keep in

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.580 
portion of this is done also keep in
mind<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:41.450> if<00:03:41.810> you're<00:03:42.049> working<00:03:42.290> with<00:03:42.560> a

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
mind that if you're working with a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.980 
mind that if you're working with a
hundred<00:03:42.980> percent<00:03:43.100> cotton<00:03:43.519> shirts<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.360> you

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
hundred percent cotton shirts and you

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.780 
hundred percent cotton shirts and you
flash<00:03:45.800> too<00:03:46.640> long

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
flash too long

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.259 
flash too long
100%<00:03:48.120> cotton<00:03:48.420> will<00:03:48.959> shrink<00:03:49.439> and<00:03:49.739> cause<00:03:50.610> your

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
100% cotton will shrink and cause your

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.140 
100% cotton will shrink and cause your
design<00:03:51.689> to<00:03:52.049> be<00:03:52.200> out<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.469> registration<00:03:53.430> so

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
design to be out of registration so

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.119 
design to be out of registration so
always<00:03:54.420> flash<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.439> to<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> point<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.010> which

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
always flash just to the point at which

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.039 
always flash just to the point at which
you<00:03:56.340> need<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.640> ink<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.450> that's<00:03:57.959> it

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
you need the ink to be and that's it

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.449 
you need the ink to be and that's it
okay<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.109> now<00:04:01.379> we're<00:04:01.560> coming<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.890> our<00:04:02.040> second

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
okay so now we're coming to our second

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.929 
okay so now we're coming to our second
color

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
color

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:15.059 
color
it's<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.989> white

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.090 

and<00:04:15.340> that's<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:16.289> there's<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.500> second<00:04:17.859> color

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and that's it there's the second color

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.520 
and that's it there's the second color
at<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.239> point<00:04:19.600> we<00:04:19.870> would<00:04:20.019> pull<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.320> shirt

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
at this point we would pull the shirt

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.400 
at this point we would pull the shirt
off<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.039> put<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:21.729> in<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.970> dryer<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.570> cure<00:04:23.259> the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
off and put it in the dryer and cure the

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.050 
off and put it in the dryer and cure the
ink<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:23.800> good<00:04:24.780> okay<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:26.560> that's<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.889> simple<00:04:27.400> two

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
ink for good okay so that's a simple two

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.230 
ink for good okay so that's a simple two
color<00:04:28.330> demonstration<00:04:29.400> okay<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:30.699> it's

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
color demonstration okay so it's

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.620 
color demonstration okay so it's
important<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.900> note<00:04:32.229> at<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.680> time<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.630> if

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630
