jerk dips dip squats in here too just to
pretty<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.850> constantly<00:00:36.420> reinforce<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
pretty much constantly reinforce that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
pretty much constantly reinforce that
balance<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:39.000> position<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.600> her

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

people have just do a single dip with
her<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.170> ahead<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> throwing<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
her we're going ahead and throwing in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.990 
her we're going ahead and throwing in
three<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.700> light<00:00:47.940> weight

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
three here it's a pretty light weight

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.080 
three here it's a pretty light weight
and<00:00:49.100> might<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.700> practice

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and might as well get some more practice

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.869 
and might as well get some more practice
in<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.870> gonna<00:00:52.020> be

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
in there that's really not gonna be

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
in there that's really not gonna be
excuse-me<00:00:53.879> taxing<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> throw

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
excuse-me taxing at all so we can throw

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
excuse-me taxing at all so we can throw
quite<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> few<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.370> few<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> those<00:00:56.940> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
quite a few that's a few of those in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.700 
quite a few that's a few of those in
there

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
there

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
there
Audra<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.890> thinks<00:00:59.489> she<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.760> doing<00:01:00.090> some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
Audra here thinks she was doing some

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.340 
Audra here thinks she was doing some
hang<00:01:00.949> snatches<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.370> mid<00:01:02.640> thigh<00:01:03.350> for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hang snatches from about mid thigh for

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.609 
hang snatches from about mid thigh for
her<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.479> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.780> way<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> keep

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
her this was kind of just a way to keep

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.670 
her this was kind of just a way to keep
the<00:01:07.830> weight<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.400> lighter<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> even

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the weight a little bit lighter so even

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
the weight a little bit lighter so even
though<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:10.950> working<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.760> essentially

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
though we were working up to essentially

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
though we were working up to essentially
what<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> maximum<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.409> day<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
what was a maximum for that day it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
what was a maximum for that day it's
naturally<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.420> bit<00:01:15.659> limited<00:01:16.020> from<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
naturally a little bit limited from that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.270 
naturally a little bit limited from that
a<00:01:17.490> fairly<00:01:17.970> high<00:01:18.270> hang<00:01:18.540> position<00:01:19.080> relative<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a fairly high hang position relative to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
a fairly high hang position relative to
what<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.640> been<00:01:20.729> from<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> floor

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
what it would have been from the floor

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.850 
what it would have been from the floor
so<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.520> also<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.060> her<00:01:24.240> working<00:01:24.659> on

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
so and it's also for her working on

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
so and it's also for her working on
bringing<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.100> bar<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bringing that bar all the way in to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
bringing that bar all the way in to
decrease<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> hips<00:01:28.110> rather<00:01:28.470> than<00:01:28.770> letting<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
decrease the hips rather than letting it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
decrease the hips rather than letting it
move<00:01:29.820> forward<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.390> off<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> upper<00:01:30.990> thighs

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
move forward right off the upper thighs

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.539 
move forward right off the upper thighs
she<00:01:31.530> sometimes<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.049> getting<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
she sometimes does and getting that

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.800 
she sometimes does and getting that
forcing<00:01:35.549> her<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.360> aggressive

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
forcing her to get that more aggressive

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
forcing her to get that more aggressive
finish<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> legs<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> top<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
finish with the legs at the top of the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
finish with the legs at the top of the
pole

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
pole

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
pole
so<00:01:39.810> she'll<00:01:40.079> sometimes<00:01:40.439> cut<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> extension<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so she'll sometimes cut that extension a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
so she'll sometimes cut that extension a
little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.820> shorter<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:43.170> she's<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
little bit shorter because she's so

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.280 
little bit shorter because she's so
focused<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.950> pulling<00:01:44.189> under<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> bar<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> when

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
focused on pulling under the bar so when

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
focused on pulling under the bar so when
you<00:01:46.350> saw<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> kicked<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.490> little

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you saw kind of kicked out just a little

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
you saw kind of kicked out just a little
bit<00:01:47.880> we'll<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.570> she<00:01:48.659> gets<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> one

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
bit we'll see if she gets this one

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
bit we'll see if she gets this one
closer<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> something<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.540> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
closer so something to think about with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.220 
closer so something to think about with
that

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.210 

something<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> think<00:01:56.830> about<00:01:57.040> what<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
something to think about what the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.990 
something to think about what the
extension<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.850> snatch<00:01:58.120> in<00:01:58.330> particular<00:01:58.840> is

connection there's less of a collision
the<00:02:29.110> bar<00:02:29.290> wants<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.650> go<00:02:29.740> forward<00:02:30.070> less<00:02:30.400> but

the bar wants to go forward less but

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.480 
the bar wants to go forward less but
then<00:02:31.360> also<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:32.050> your<00:02:32.800> upper<00:02:33.100> body<00:02:33.340> to

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
control the path of the bar so even if

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.620 
control the path of the bar so even if
you<00:02:36.340> slam<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:37.150> out<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.420> bar<00:02:37.600> with

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
you slam the out of the bar with

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
you slam the out of the bar with
your<00:02:37.930> hips<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:39.460> should<00:02:39.490> be<00:02:39.880> forcing<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.540> to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630

sides<00:02:51.430> rather<00:02:51.910> than<00:02:52.180> back<00:02:52.540> or<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:52.930> letting

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
sides rather than back or just letting

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.370

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.230 
that bar swing around your body so again
it's<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.160> still<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:57.880> as<00:02:57.970> aggressive

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
it's you still have to be as aggressive

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.820 
it's you still have to be as aggressive
as<00:02:58.480> possible<00:02:58.540> with<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.140> hips<00:02:59.350> but<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.620> have

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
as possible with the hips but you have

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.240 
as possible with the hips but you have
to<00:02:59.950> enter<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.630> final<00:03:01.630> action<00:03:02.140> properly<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
to enter that final action properly and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.710 
to enter that final action properly and
then<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.430> have<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.730> control<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> bar<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.690> your

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
then you have to control the bar in your

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.390 
then you have to control the bar in your
body<00:03:04.989> afterwards<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:05.950> well

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
body afterwards as well

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.150 
body afterwards as well
you<00:03:06.910> can't<00:03:07.150> just<00:03:07.500> spank<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.650> bar<00:03:08.860> with<00:03:09.040> your

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
you can't just spank the bar with your

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.220 
you can't just spank the bar with your
hips<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:09.730> cross<00:03:10.600> your<00:03:10.750> fingers<00:03:10.900> it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
hips and then cross your fingers it

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.840 
hips and then cross your fingers it
hopes<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> goes<00:03:11.739> or<00:03:12.070> hope<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.400> goes<00:03:12.550> into<00:03:12.730> that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
hopes it goes or hope it goes into that

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.170 
hopes it goes or hope it goes into that
overhead<00:03:13.209> position<00:03:14.220> Alyssa<00:03:15.220> here<00:03:15.610> clean

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
overhead position Alyssa here clean

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.479 
overhead position Alyssa here clean
poles<00:03:16.480> 90<00:03:17.080> kilos

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
poles 90 kilos

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.550 
poles 90 kilos
I<00:03:18.520> think<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> poles<00:03:19.780> during<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.260> period

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
I think the poles during this period

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.440 
I think the poles during this period
weren't<00:03:20.920> super<00:03:21.400> heavy<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.239> first

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
weren't super heavy for that first

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.690 
weren't super heavy for that first
couple<00:03:22.690> weeks<00:03:23.100> there's<00:03:24.100> more<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.489> kind<00:03:24.580> of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
couple weeks there's more just kind of

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.030 
couple weeks there's more just kind of
getting<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.030> volume<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.600> there<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.920> were

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
getting some volume in there we were

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.590 
getting some volume in there we were
doing<00:03:27.310> some<00:03:27.489> higher<00:03:27.700> reps<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.209> squad<00:03:28.570> I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
doing some higher reps in the squad I

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.090 
doing some higher reps in the squad I
think<00:03:28.840> they<00:03:28.959> were<00:03:29.050> doing<00:03:29.200> sixes<00:03:29.800> at<00:03:29.950> this

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
think they were doing sixes at this

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
think they were doing sixes at this
point<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.860> like<00:03:32.860> Alyssa<00:03:33.160> for<00:03:33.340> example<00:03:33.730> would

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
point so like Alyssa for example would

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.710 
point so like Alyssa for example would
work<00:03:34.269> up<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.600> 5<00:03:34.780> sets<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.230> 6<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.769> back<00:03:35.950> squad

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
work up to 5 sets of 6 in the back squad

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.310 
work up to 5 sets of 6 in the back squad
on<00:03:37.720> Monday<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.920> then<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.370> believe<00:03:39.790> she<00:03:40.000> had

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
on Monday and then I believe she had

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.500 
on Monday and then I believe she had
pause<00:03:41.320> front<00:03:41.980> squat<00:03:42.310> triples<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.000> Wednesday

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
pause front squat triples on Wednesday

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.199 
pause front squat triples on Wednesday
and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.530> back<00:03:44.800> squat<00:03:45.100> triples<00:03:45.489> on<00:03:45.640> Saturday

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and then back squat triples on Saturday

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.270 
and then back squat triples on Saturday
so<00:03:46.269> they<00:03:46.510> were<00:03:46.570> they<00:03:47.170> were<00:03:47.230> doing<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.590> pretty

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
so they were they were doing a pretty

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.570 
so they were they were doing a pretty

inches below the bar and then of course

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.280 
inches below the bar and then of course
you<00:04:31.060> have<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.270> bar<00:04:31.480> falling<00:04:31.840> on<00:04:32.140> them

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
you have the bar falling on them

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.900 
you have the bar falling on them
crashing<00:04:32.800> on<00:04:32.890> their<00:04:33.010> shoulders<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.400> crushing

them so you know if you're tough and
you're<00:04:37.060> fairly<00:04:37.270> strong<00:04:37.690> sometimes<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.260> can

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
you're fairly strong sometimes you can

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.710 
you're fairly strong sometimes you can

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
get away with that but it's a lot more

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.150 
get away with that but it's a lot more
work<00:04:40.780> than<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.200> needs<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.590> be<00:04:41.710> it's<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:41.950> lot

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
work than it needs to be it's a lot

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
you might as well just learn to turn the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.180 
you might as well just learn to turn the
bar<00:04:46.570> over<00:04:46.900> better<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:48.000> meet<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:50.290> power

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
cleans for audre are part of that - she

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.020 
cleans for audre are part of that - she
has<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.850> habit<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:56.770> her<00:04:56.980> heavier<00:04:57.340> cleans<00:04:57.670> she

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
has a habit of on her heavier cleans she

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.400 
has a habit of on her heavier cleans she
gets<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.270> little<00:04:58.450> freaked<00:04:58.720> out<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.080> she<00:04:59.200> takes

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
gets a little freaked out and she takes

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.920 
gets a little freaked out and she takes
too<00:04:59.620> long<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.950> turn<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.310> over<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.750> she's

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
too long to turn it over and so she's

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.180 
too long to turn it over and so she's
kind<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.170> hitting<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.500> bottom<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.920> the<00:05:02.980> squat

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.530 
kind of hitting the bottom of the squat
at<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.490> same<00:05:03.700> time<00:05:03.910> she's<00:05:04.180> trying<00:05:04.450> to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
at the same time she's trying to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.240 
at the same time she's trying to
finalize<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.230> turnover<00:05:05.680> which<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.950> way<00:05:06.190> too

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
finalize that turnover which is way too

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.060 
finalize that turnover which is way too
late<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:07.480> look<00:05:07.690> at<00:05:07.840> people<00:05:08.620> who<00:05:08.650> are<00:05:08.830> really

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
late you look at people who are really

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.740 
late you look at people who are really
good<00:05:09.190> at<00:05:09.250> cleans<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:09.910> even<00:05:10.210> their<00:05:10.360> heaviest

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
good at cleans and even their heaviest

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.540 
good at cleans and even their heaviest
lifts<00:05:11.320> if<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:12.400> kind<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.030> stop<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:13.600> or<00:05:13.840> you

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
lifts if you kind of stop that or you

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.220 
lifts if you kind of stop that or you
watch<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.790> video<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.210> very<00:05:16.390> slow<00:05:16.690> motion<00:05:17.110> you

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
watch the video and very slow motion you

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.020 
watch the video and very slow motion you
can<00:05:17.410> see<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.860> they've<00:05:18.040> essentially<00:05:18.460> secured

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
can see that they've essentially secured

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.180 
can see that they've essentially secured
the<00:05:19.180> bar<00:05:19.360> in<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.600> rack<00:05:19.780> position<00:05:20.190> while

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
the bar in the rack position while

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.020 
the bar in the rack position while
they're<00:05:21.400> at<00:05:21.610> or<00:05:21.910> above<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:23.370> parallel<00:05:24.370> squat<00:05:24.760> so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
they're at or above a parallel squat so

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.570 
they're at or above a parallel squat so
it'll<00:05:25.420> usually<00:05:25.600> be<00:05:25.810> pretty<00:05:26.320> high<00:05:26.620> there<00:05:27.520> are

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
it'll usually be pretty high there are

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.100 
it'll usually be pretty high there are
some<00:05:27.820> lifters<00:05:28.120> who<00:05:28.150> don't<00:05:28.450> do<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.840> there

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
some lifters who don't do that there

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.110 
some lifters who don't do that there
they're<00:05:29.740> really<00:05:30.040> good<00:05:30.220> at<00:05:30.310> not<00:05:30.550> pulling<00:05:30.970> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
they're really good at not pulling the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.570 
they're really good at not pulling the
bar<00:05:31.300> high<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.930> should<00:05:32.470> rephrase<00:05:32.740> that<00:05:33.040> they're

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
bar high I should rephrase that they're

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.460 
bar high I should rephrase that they're
really<00:05:33.790> good<00:05:34.060> at<00:05:34.090> getting<00:05:34.390> under<00:05:34.810> very<00:05:35.230> heavy

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
really good at getting under very heavy

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
really good at getting under very heavy
weights<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.130> they<00:05:36.250> can't<00:05:36.640> pull<00:05:36.970> high<00:05:37.210> so

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
weights that they can't pull high so

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.430 
weights that they can't pull high so
that's<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.820> good<00:05:40.240> trait<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.600> have<00:05:40.630> but<00:05:41.140> when

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
that's a good trait to have but when

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
that's a good trait to have but when
you're<00:05:41.620> doing<00:05:42.160> 70<00:05:42.880> 80<00:05:43.260> 85<00:05:44.260> percent<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:44.980> you're

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
you're doing 70 80 85 percent and you're

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.770 
you're doing 70 80 85 percent and you're
still<00:05:45.700> pulling<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.180> bar<00:05:46.360> as<00:05:46.480> hard<00:05:46.690> as

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
still pulling the bar as hard as

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.600 
still pulling the bar as hard as
possible<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.530> need<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:47.980> be<00:05:48.070> able<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.310> meet<00:05:48.460> it

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
possible you need to be able to meet it

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.360 
possible you need to be able to meet it
with<00:05:48.730> your<00:05:48.880> shoulders<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.100> essentially<00:05:51.100> stay

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
entire lift rather than throwing it up

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.620 
entire lift rather than throwing it up
in<00:05:54.790> the<00:05:54.940> air<00:05:55.090> and<00:05:55.270> then<00:05:55.360> trying<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.750> catch<00:05:55.960> it
