00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.060 

that<00:00:20.750> was<00:00:20.840> a<00:00:20.869> good<00:00:21.019> sort<00:00:21.320> of<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:21.650> know<00:00:21.679> team

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
that was a good sort of you know team

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.859 
that was a good sort of you know team
performance<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:22.789> that<00:00:23.029> was<00:00:23.210> important<00:00:23.689> I

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
performance and that was important I

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.269 
performance and that was important I
think<00:00:24.320> given<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:24.829> haven't<00:00:25.039> played<00:00:25.160> since

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
think given we haven't played since

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.740 
think given we haven't played since
November<00:00:25.910> we're<00:00:26.269> always<00:00:26.390> going<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.660> be<00:00:26.689> a

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
November we're always going to be a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.939 
November we're always going to be a
little<00:00:26.960> bit<00:00:27.079> rusty<00:00:27.410> but<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.619> think<00:00:27.890> we

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
little bit rusty but I think we

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.380 
little bit rusty but I think we
surprised<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.310> lot<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.520> people<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.939> sitting<00:00:29.329> in

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
surprised a lot of people and sitting in

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.840 
surprised a lot of people and sitting in
their<00:00:29.539> first<00:00:29.689> half

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
their first half

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.920 
their first half
I<00:00:31.940> think<00:00:32.840> Rory<00:00:33.080> and<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:34.450> Chris<00:00:35.450> Coleman<00:00:35.750> led

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
I think Rory and and Chris Coleman led

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.960 
I think Rory and and Chris Coleman led
the<00:00:36.050> line<00:00:36.230> extremely<00:00:36.770> well<00:00:36.920> at<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.130> top<00:00:37.340> what

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
the line extremely well at the top what

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.070 
the line extremely well at the top what
made<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.270> very<00:00:38.450> difficult<00:00:38.480> for<00:00:38.900> the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
made it very difficult for the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.190 
made it very difficult for the
Australians<00:00:40.420> but<00:00:41.420> we<00:00:41.540> worked<00:00:41.750> hard<00:00:42.020> in<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
Australians but we worked hard in the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.630 
Australians but we worked hard in the
middle<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.560> park<00:00:42.860> where<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.370> thought<00:00:43.580> we

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
middle of the park where we thought we

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.130 
middle of the park where we thought we
might<00:00:43.940> get<00:00:44.060> a<00:00:44.120> little<00:00:44.300> bit<00:00:44.510> outnumbered<00:00:44.660> but

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
might get a little bit outnumbered but

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.100 
might get a little bit outnumbered but
we<00:00:45.290> didn't<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.430> again<00:00:47.360> at<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.570> back<00:00:47.750> of<00:00:47.780> think

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
we didn't and again at the back of think

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.229 
we didn't and again at the back of think
you<00:00:48.230> know<00:00:48.350> Ryan's<00:00:48.710> influence<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.460> Ben

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
you know Ryan's influence and Ben

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.880 
you know Ryan's influence and Ben
Sigmund<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:50.900> open<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.350> solution<00:00:51.770> foot

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
Sigmund and open the solution foot

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.850 
Sigmund and open the solution foot
they're<00:00:52.040> very<00:00:52.220> accomplished

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.890 

really<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.670> mean<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.060> a<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
really good I mean that's a that's a

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.240 
really good I mean that's a that's a
great<00:00:58.080> thing<00:00:58.200> about<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.560> group<00:00:58.770> living<00:00:58.920> from

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
great thing about this group living from

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
great thing about this group living from
from<00:00:59.610> day<00:00:59.790> dot<00:01:00.000> they're<00:01:00.270> being<00:01:00.480> they're

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
from day dot they're being they're

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.100 
from day dot they're being they're
extremely<00:01:01.410> tight<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.820> ambitious<00:01:03.780> too

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
extremely tight and very ambitious too

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.520 
extremely tight and very ambitious too
but<00:01:04.410> no<00:01:04.920> there's<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> strong<00:01:05.460> unity<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.530> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but no there's a strong unity and you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.690 
but no there's a strong unity and you
know<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.620> think<00:01:07.710> we'll<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.370> right

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
know I think we'll see that right right

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.560 
know I think we'll see that right right
the<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.880> through<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.120> world<00:01:09.300> cup

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.540 

we'll<00:01:14.260> try<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.530> get<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:14.860> many<00:01:15.010> back-to-back

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
we'll try and get as many back-to-back

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.360 
we'll try and get as many back-to-back
sessions<00:01:15.760> as<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:16.300> can<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.710> know<00:01:17.830> altitudes

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
sessions as we can you know altitudes

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.520 
sessions as we can you know altitudes
the<00:01:18.580> obvious<00:01:19.120> reason<00:01:19.750> for<00:01:19.930> being<00:01:20.110> there<00:01:20.140> so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
the obvious reason for being there so

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.830 
the obvious reason for being there so
you<00:01:21.400> know<00:01:21.490> we'll<00:01:21.880> take<00:01:21.910> into<00:01:22.330> account<00:01:22.510> what<00:01:22.720> we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
you know we'll take into account what we

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.020 
you know we'll take into account what we
need<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.140> fulfill<00:01:23.560> with<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:23.830> one<00:01:23.979> but<00:01:24.160> yeah

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
need to fulfill with that one but yeah

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.580 
need to fulfill with that one but yeah
couple<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.390> sessions<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.840> day<00:01:25.870> probably<00:01:26.290> back

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
couple of sessions a day probably back

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.210 
couple of sessions a day probably back
off<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:27.040> little<00:01:27.610> bit<00:01:27.729> leading<00:01:28.150> into<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.479> match

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
off a little bit leading into the match

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.469 
off a little bit leading into the match
but<00:01:30.220> again<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.520> mean<00:01:30.729> some<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:30.970> these<00:01:31.060> base<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
but again I mean some of these base and

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.499 
but again I mean some of these base and
pay<00:01:31.690> for<00:01:31.720> three<00:01:32.229> or<00:01:32.320> four<00:01:32.470> months<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:34.300> time

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
pay for three or four months so the time

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.359 
pay for three or four months so the time
on<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> park<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.440> time<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.130> training

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
on the park and the time on the training

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.650 
on the park and the time on the training
pitch<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.759> really<00:01:37.000> important<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:37.390> them<00:01:37.570> at

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
pitch is really important for them at

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.190 
pitch is really important for them at
the<00:01:37.750> moment

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.020 

that's<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.860> thing<00:01:42.070> for<00:01:42.280> us<00:01:42.310> now<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:42.700> we've<00:01:42.880> got<00:01:42.909> a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
that's a thing for us now is we've got a

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.609 
that's a thing for us now is we've got a
program<00:01:43.479> we've<00:01:43.659> got<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.840> we've<00:01:44.079> got<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.350> kind

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
program we've got to we've got to kind

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.279 
program we've got to we've got to kind
of<00:01:44.710> stick<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.280> know<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.610> back<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:46.289> the

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
of stick to it you know the back is the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.279 
of stick to it you know the back is the
main<00:01:47.500> target<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.219> a<00:01:48.850> couple<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.750> niggles<00:01:50.079> and

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
main target so a couple of niggles and

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.749 
main target so a couple of niggles and
bumps<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:51.219> know<00:01:51.310> we're<00:01:51.460> kind<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.670> going

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
bumps and you know we're kind of going

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.149 
bumps and you know we're kind of going
to<00:01:51.909> get<00:01:52.000> those<00:01:52.179> along<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.539> way<00:01:52.689> but<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.979> won't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
to get those along the way but we won't

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.889 
to get those along the way but we won't
hold<00:01:54.340> back<00:01:54.429> it<00:01:55.240> means<00:01:55.450> we're<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> little<00:01:55.719> bit

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
hold back it means we're a little bit

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.600 
hold back it means we're a little bit
lethargic<00:01:56.049> going<00:01:56.590> into<00:01:56.860> Serbia<00:01:57.250> or<00:01:57.340> whatever

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
lethargic going into Serbia or whatever

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.419 
lethargic going into Serbia or whatever
then<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.659> know<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.319> so<00:01:59.350> it's<00:02:00.100> not<00:02:00.220> it's

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
then you know so be it so it's not it's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.399
