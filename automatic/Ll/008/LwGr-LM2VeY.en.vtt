now<00:05:00.290> saved<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.250> system<00:05:01.640> but<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:01.940> can't

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
now saved to the system but you can't

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.300 
now saved to the system but you can't
access<00:05:02.360> directly<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.890> have<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.130> download

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
access directly so you have to download

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.080 
access directly so you have to download
it<00:05:04.520> onto<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:05.720> USB<00:05:06.680> storage<00:05:07.010> device<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.640> then

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
it onto a USB storage device and then

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.210 
it onto a USB storage device and then
you<00:05:08.150> have<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.300> upload<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.750> back<00:05:09.050> on<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:10.010> that's

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
you have to upload it back on so that's

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.920 
you have to upload it back on so that's
kind<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.640> I<00:05:10.880> think<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.300> works<00:05:11.480> like<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.660> so

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
kind of I think it works like that so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.640 
kind of I think it works like that so
it's<00:05:12.050> kind<00:05:12.230> of<00:05:12.260> weird

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
it's kind of weird

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.370 
it's kind of weird
however<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.730> think<00:05:14.300> I'm<00:05:14.480> gonna<00:05:14.600> wrap<00:05:14.990> this<00:05:15.140> up

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
however I think I'm gonna wrap this up

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.380 
however I think I'm gonna wrap this up
