00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.160
 time are lost all 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.589
 hi to all those dead who today 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.239
 on skyrim 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.239
 finally I'm sure it's a gameplay of 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.500
 skyrim to talk to you soon 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.649
 a game that goes out in a few 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 years they want funny 6 so your 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.600
 os 6 the next opus skyrim what's 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.949
 Val-d'or crumbles so it's not of course 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.000
 not they want their light column which 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.710
 will go out in a few months ago there is a 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.140
 down payment of the habitat all that so that's 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 really a school gold val 6 1 so the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.600
 solo game et cetera as oblivion this 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.280
 terrible and all so that's actually I 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.649
 some information that I saw on 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.739
 internet so it was an American site 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.800
 which is translated so here you are 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.440
 talk about what will be in sedan itself 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.570
 want funny but it's really little 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.700
 it's not really a video 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.050
 you really are waiting for a game because seen 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.550
 that the game is coming out in two years and 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.840
 that they will be just some info and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.070
 not even officially because it's 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 possible otherwise I think you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.630
 know already so I will you I 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 Directly advise us jazzy frozen 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.950
 go out in 2016 so it's been two years and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 half unfortunately she has a lot who 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.250
 are going to be disappointed but hey it's for 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.259
 to have a good game must still know 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.659
 wait so that's it so will come out 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.369
 normally on a new generation 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.689
 maybe I do not know anything it's a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.270
 new generation any case I think 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.780
 not that it would be on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.869
 so here's after I'll talk to you the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.939
 region should be called aka turn so 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 it will be my career because I know 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.890
 not if you noticed but not 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.500
 together 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 Oblivion had a name in Herve 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.539
 so suddenly it's been four years on 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.860
 roman after skyrim come come skyrim 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.829
 there was 1.5 also in finally no I 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.360
 do not think I do not know anyway 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.530
 case in oblivion I find that I know 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.299
 not if it was done on purpose but in any case 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.399
 case in oblivion the letters comes there 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.320
 had all that was 4 then the ceac 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.530
 Avian as Paralympians lived and a 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.750
 reads so it's 6 end that you're his game c 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 is a personal thing we end up wanking 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 completely 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 so here is the region should 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.799
 to be called callière is perhaps the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.930
 same game but that's not safe at all 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.300
 in any case it is the region no there 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.250
 will have new breeds 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.960
 us that there will be for now 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.120
 that two new breeds that are been 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.280
 given it's a breed of saint jean done 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 a race or it looks a bit like 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.680
 monkeys is a race where would you 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.870
 demos in fact here are demons after he 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.850
 may be a mode in play 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.620
 cooperative with a partner or 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.350
 many friends i do not know i do not know 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 it will be 2 or chip is in 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.130
 split screen multiplayer 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.350
 I think rather that this rank in 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.290
 multiplayer there will also be mounts 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.770
 flying so that in the dlc of skyrim y 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 had already been cold I'm not sure 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.170
 a gunvor western wall one could 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 ride on dragon but that may be that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.820
 I say big bullshit anyway 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.100
 I believe 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.200
 and then yeah I think that's true 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.820
 anyway but I already had pictures 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.620
 in a brief women's magazine so there they 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.330
 will be able to have flying mounts 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.060
 so doubled of aragon it's not going to be 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.290
 something else it would be dragons 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.150
 we may be able to also have a new 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
 narrative style that is as 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.920
 I walk when you speak to NPC 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.110
 will not be a normal life we ​​see the pnj 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.730
 like that with the stuff to say and everything 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.270
 the str with cameras 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.040
 a bit like cinematics in fact 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.540
 here are some cinematics 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.390
 after there will be more interactions with 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.400
 important characters that's according to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.320
 more flexibility or that's where 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.200
 I do you could do the story 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.070
 to develop finally 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.270
 develop the world wholesale this the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.830
 hijack and finally that's like in a 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.630
 little fable where they not seek if you 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.140
 know or flock to the course 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.530
 Of the history 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.820
 facing him will have more than before 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.680
 so that's it so I 'll finish with a 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.720
 last point actually it will be that there will be 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.760
 more automatic backup especially 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.989
 have fun expectations like that so at 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.220
 less if you if you play and and that 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.500
 you get killed 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.090
 sorry I have to pronounce it if you 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 get killed while playing since 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.070
 two hours you do not have 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.300
 saved cart back 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.980
 automatic about every five 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.419
 minutes so that's just me in this 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.310
 frame I remember game in custody and at 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.989
 every time 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.040
 ajoie that came stuff had to go in like that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.740
 so would not want to do it anymore 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.580
 will often have backups 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.520
 automatic 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.500
 so here it is stuffed all the info 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.930
 holds for now so I hope that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.160
 it will have informed you that you are 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.440
 glad to hear that she will have 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.910
 minus one sixth is unfortunately m 6 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.410
 hours in not long that and 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.940
 some info that I could give if 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.030
 I have news news I will tell you 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.160
