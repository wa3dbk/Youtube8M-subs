00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.029
 on design revived by your word 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.350
 We are now beginning to read the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.019
 isaiah's book 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.960
 Isaiah was a prophet who prophesied for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.120
 more than 50 years but it's not about 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
 of which he is one of the greatest prophets 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.859
 in fact it is because there is a section in the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.550
 bible which is called the greatest prophets 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.720
 which are books with more amount of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.150
 prophecies or chapters 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.130
 therefore they are considered larger by 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 because the book is not by 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.100
 because its importance and these books are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 isaiah jeremiah lamentations ezequiel and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 daniel 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 16 were the greatest prophets and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 from isahias to malachias 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.520
 therefore they were and 400 years of ministry 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 between the years 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.149
 800 to 400 before Christ 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 the name isaiah means the lord is the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 salvation 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 He was married and fathered two children. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 with very different names to act up and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.189
 march there the radio buzz the book of isaiah 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.250
 has 66 chapters just as the Bible has 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.010
 66 books the first thirty-nine 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 chapters of the book are messages of 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.310
 and the other 27 chapters can be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 divided more or less so messages 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.070
 chapters 5666 are the messages of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.799
 hope 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 isaías was quoted a new testament more 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.009
 of 90 times as a book of isaiah is the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 most quoted from all of the Old Testament 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.930
 and also because it has many 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.140
 prophetic aspects of the birth of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.130
 of the sufferings and death of 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.079
 Jesus 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 he is known as the fifth gospel 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.299
 therefore they are mateus marcos lucas and joão 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.600
 reading the prophecies of isaiah 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.170
 especially those that have been fulfilled 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.920
 700 years later in the life of our 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920
