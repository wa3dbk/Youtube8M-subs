I<00:00:38.260> think<00:00:38.920> Vancouver<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:39.670> very<00:00:39.940> special

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
I think Vancouver is so very special

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.690 
I think Vancouver is so very special
because<00:00:40.810> I<00:00:41.260> have<00:00:41.500> never<00:00:41.770> seen<00:00:42.130> another<00:00:42.430> place

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
because I have never seen another place

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.900 
because I have never seen another place
where<00:00:43.120> city<00:00:43.930> life<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.559> nature<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:45.610> close

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
where city life and nature is so close
