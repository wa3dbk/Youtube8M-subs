being<00:01:48.600> who<00:01:48.780> could<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.140> feel<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
being who could actually feel that but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.060 
being who could actually feel that but
bandit<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.640> bandit<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:52.079> sensitive<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
bandit could bandit was sensitive to it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.290 
bandit could bandit was sensitive to it
it<00:01:53.220> worked<00:01:53.399> very<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.909> maintaining<00:01:54.570> his

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
it worked very well for maintaining his

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.600 
it worked very well for maintaining his
and<00:01:55.750> again<00:01:56.020> that's<00:01:56.710> really<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.130> goal<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
and again that's really the goal in the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.790 
and again that's really the goal in the
beginning<00:01:57.780> limited<00:01:58.780> distractions<00:01:59.560> very

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
beginning limited distractions very

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.740 
beginning limited distractions very
little<00:02:00.100> going<00:02:00.370> on<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.730> teaching<00:02:01.240> him<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.570> pay

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
little going on just teaching him to pay

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.530 
little going on just teaching him to pay
attention<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.380> he<00:02:02.590> felt<00:02:02.830> stim<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.820> stay<00:02:04.150> with

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
attention when he felt stim to stay with

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.810 
attention when he felt stim to stay with
me<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.140> then<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.070> progressed<00:02:06.490> we're<00:02:06.700> going

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
me and then as we progressed we're going

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.460 
me and then as we progressed we're going
to<00:02:06.880> start<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.020> more<00:02:08.200> trigger

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
to start to use that in the more trigger

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.090 
to start to use that in the more trigger
scenarios<00:02:09.510> again<00:02:10.510> this<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.410> also<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.920> first

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
scenarios again this is also the first

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.620 
scenarios again this is also the first
day<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.640> another<00:02:12.880> session<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.330> little<00:02:13.420> bit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
day this is another session a little bit

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.720 
day this is another session a little bit
later<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.990> went<00:02:14.200> back<00:02:14.290> into<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.920> hallway<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
later I went back into that hallway that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.330 
later I went back into that hallway that
entry<00:02:16.030> where<00:02:16.240> where<00:02:16.720> he<00:02:16.990> had<00:02:17.200> some<00:02:17.440> initial

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
entry where where he had some initial

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.850 
entry where where he had some initial
problems<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.870> wall<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.320> can't<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.830> very

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
problems the wall you can't see it very

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.530 
problems the wall you can't see it very
well<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> wall<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> left<00:02:22.390> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
well but the wall is just to the left of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.850 
well but the wall is just to the left of
me<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.690> course<00:02:23.080> there's<00:02:23.290> dogs<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.830> other

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.610 
me and course there's dogs on the other
side<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:25.270> I'm<00:02:25.450> doing<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.870> insisting<00:02:26.440> that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
side so all I'm doing is insisting that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.910 
side so all I'm doing is insisting that
he<00:02:26.890> walk<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:27.580> me<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.120> stop<00:02:28.600> with<00:02:28.960> me<00:02:29.230> and

he walk with me and stop with me and
again<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.610> about<00:02:30.820> leadership<00:02:31.060> it's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
again this is about leadership it's

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.240 
again this is about leadership it's
about<00:02:31.780> him<00:02:32.020> paying<00:02:32.260> attention<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:33.220> I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250

it's<00:03:06.000> back<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.420> forth<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.020> forth<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
it's back and forth back and forth a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
it's back and forth back and forth a
little<00:03:07.860> bit<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.340> notice<00:03:09.210> there<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> see

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
little bit of notice there you see

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.550 
little bit of notice there you see
together<00:03:09.960> if<00:03:10.350> there's<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.770> other<00:03:10.860> dogs<00:03:12.560> and

together if there's the other dogs and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.890 
together if there's the other dogs and
again<00:03:13.800> my<00:03:14.010> goal<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.520> not<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.270> react<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.570> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.270 
again my goal is not to react to that
I'm<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.230> teaching<00:03:16.560> him<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:16.920> doesn't

matter<00:03:17.460> really<00:03:17.760> what's<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.330> on<00:03:18.540> over<00:03:18.720> there

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
matter really what's going on over there

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.840 
matter really what's going on over there
he<00:03:19.230> needs<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.530> pay<00:03:19.770> attention<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.340> me<00:03:20.550> that's

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
he needs to pay attention to me that's

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.350 
he needs to pay attention to me that's
my<00:03:21.120> only<00:03:21.470> expectation<00:03:22.470> he<00:03:23.160> starts<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.670> react<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360

my only expectation he starts to react I
keep<00:03:25.080> moving<00:03:25.550> he<00:03:26.550> needs<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.060> follow<00:03:27.270> me<00:03:27.630> that's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
keep moving he needs to follow me that's

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.100

things I really like about it is how
non-confrontational<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:06.830> just

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
non-confrontational it is it's just

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.909 
non-confrontational it is it's just
using<00:05:07.400> sensation<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.900> communicate<00:05:09.500> with<00:05:09.680> him

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
using sensation to communicate with him

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.370 
using sensation to communicate with him
follow<00:05:10.729> me<00:05:11.000> when<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.389> sensation<00:05:11.870> goes<00:05:12.080> away

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
follow me when the sensation goes away

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.290 
follow me when the sensation goes away
that<00:05:13.040> means<00:05:13.100> he's<00:05:13.460> doing<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:13.820> right<00:05:14.000> thing

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
that means he's doing the right thing

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.000 
that means he's doing the right thing
when<00:05:14.479> he<00:05:14.600> feels<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.990> sensation<00:05:15.169> then<00:05:15.830> he's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
when he feels the sensation then he's

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.800 
when he feels the sensation then he's
distracted<00:05:16.669> I'm<00:05:16.790> using<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.300> get<00:05:17.630> his

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
distracted I'm using it to get his

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.390 
distracted I'm using it to get his
attention<00:05:18.290> back<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.680> think<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:19.010> it<00:05:19.130> kind<00:05:19.250> of

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
attention back I think of it kind of

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.330 
attention back I think of it kind of
like<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.580> GPS<00:05:20.060> unit<00:05:20.630> tap<00:05:21.199> tap<00:05:21.440> tap<00:05:21.500> means<00:05:22.010> you're

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
like a GPS unit tap tap tap means you're

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.540 
like a GPS unit tap tap tap means you're
off<00:05:23.060> route<00:05:23.479> no<00:05:24.229> taps<00:05:24.500> means<00:05:24.830> you're<00:05:25.040> on<00:05:25.220> route

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
off route no taps means you're on route

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.460 
off route no taps means you're on route
and<00:05:25.820> it's<00:05:25.970> very<00:05:26.300> easy<00:05:26.600> for<00:05:26.870> him<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.139> start<00:05:27.350> to

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
and it's very easy for him to start to

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.530 
and it's very easy for him to start to
figure<00:05:27.620> this<00:05:27.860> out<00:05:28.070> that<00:05:28.400> he<00:05:28.729> needs<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.240> follow

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
figure this out that he needs to follow
