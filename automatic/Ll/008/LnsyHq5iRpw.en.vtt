00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 I show you how to start practicing 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 fifths to play any song that 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.980
 you think if you're a beginner 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.910
 guitar I'm Martin and this is a video 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.910
 guitar from scratch 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 first you have to get the chords 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.939
 the song you want to play separate 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 the progression of chords that the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 song into smaller pieces like 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 can be a verse the chorus and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.570
 turn those pieces in part of the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.219
 small the song that I have chosen 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.989
 has four contributions from the minor 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.879
 and they are once you have the chords 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 you have to locate the base note of the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.440
 chord in the strings is and fifth 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.280
 in my case the chords will be 2 and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.280
 I have a 2 here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.600
 a the least I have the here 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.000
 a fa 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.000
 this is a fan 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.909
 and a sun that is this 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 then I have already located my four 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 notes that are what they are 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.590
 play those notes always treading on the 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.689
 finger one 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.689
 always with your finger 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:45.500
 and make it possible 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.210
 close to guerrilla from now on 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.420
 complicate a bit the thing you have to 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.960
 touch those notes but adding the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.880
 fifth then I would put the index 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.690
 in the dow 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 and the other two fingers 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.030
 I'm careful not to blow the sixth 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 rope 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.240
 in I put the index on the side and the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.930
 two other fingers 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.930
 and ring 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.540
 efe 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.160
 and the sun 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.690
 I have already separated the progression of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.000
 chords of my song in verse 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.040
 chorus and the stanza can play 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.370
 the first four only with the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.640
 index finger then in my case the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640
 stanza 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.430
 two 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.430
 Sun 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.430
 to 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.030
 I learn that aside 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:08.300
 I add the tapes in the 2nd 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.300
 they are the fifa 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.620
 the second part 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.280
 of my stanza starting 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 Sun 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.520
 and 2 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.520
 I learned that second part well 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.190
 and when I have learned I stick to 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.190
 the fifths 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.950
 ah 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.340
 once I have the whole chorus 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.110
 then to play whole first only 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.069
 the notes with the index finger in my case 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.280
 two 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:04.780
 Only faith 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.780
 and not only for not 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.890
 when I learn that progression 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.430
 element the fifths 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.430
 would be 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.960
 the same with the refrain in my case the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.580
 chorus also has eight measures 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.530
 of which I will take four and 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.530
 four the first four are the sun 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.790
 ah 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.440
 all with the index finger 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.490
 and later 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.490
 we put the 5th 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.630
 the second part of the chorus matches 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.330
 which is like the second part of the 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.310
 stanza then what is 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.310
 they are not 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.610
 I put the removes 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.240
 Now that I have the refrain I play the 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.480
 chorus followed only the notes 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.480
 first would be the sun 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.890
 and then with graffiti 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.620
 the next step is to add the rasgueos 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.529
 to each of those parts that you've 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.319
 learned 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.319
 in my case the first part was 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.740
 Sun 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.780
 and I add the traces that are in this 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.980
 case there are four strokes in each chord 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.980
 then it would be 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.690
 the second part of our fa that would be 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:48.680
 the first part of chorus and 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.680
 second part of the chorus 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.289
 once you have mastered the 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.869
 complete progression 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.389
 you start to hum through the pieces 

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:05.860
 little ones that you have learned before and in 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.270
 this case 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.270
 now if you recognize the song 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.490
 nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.539
 no longer 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.020
 no way 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.440
 for 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.559
 why 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:40.509
 ah 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:40.509
 nothing at all 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.720
 Ghana 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:53.460
 well you just have to put the letter 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.460
 and above 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.840
 Thank you 

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.890
