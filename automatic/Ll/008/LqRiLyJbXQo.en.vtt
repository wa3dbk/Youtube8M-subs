 volkswagen presents fox bluemotion 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.390
 2014 Brazil debut in the new engine 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 three-cylinder 1.0 liter family 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.650
 and to 211 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 it is the most modern engine manufactured 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.840
 by Volkswagen in the country as much as 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 respect to its production process 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 the resources available to it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.720
 with the new engine fox bluemotion is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.239
 makes the first Volkswagen for the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.339
 Brazilian market with a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:09.180
 three cylinders and one more model 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:11.670
 of the brand in Brazil produced 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 in são carlos in the interior of são paulo 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 211 was developed according to the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.200
 energy efficiency criteria 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 and lower fuel consumption 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 the new engine is capable of generating 75 horses 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.340
 power with gasoline and 82 horses 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.850
 with ethanol in relation to touch are 9.7 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.470
 kilometer force meter with gasoline and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.370
 10.4 kilograms-force meter with ethanol 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 but 85% of the force is now available 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.810
 from 2000 rpm, which improves the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.810
 low-response vehicle responses 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.830
 the engine and the 211 1.0 liter has a block and 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 the heads made of aluminum 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.790
 Three-cylinder construction means 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 not only fewer components 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.330
 piston and bearings as well as 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.399
 less heat loss, which increases its 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.940
 thermal efficiency when compared to a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.310
 four-cylinder engine with four 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.710
 valves per cylinder, the cylinder head has 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.440
 variable intake control 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.050
 exhaust manifold integrated by remote 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.450
 one piece with liquid cooling 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.670
 and this allows the engine to reach its 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.800
 ideal operating temperature plus 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.640
 quickly improving their efficiency 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.270
 other innovative solution adopted 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.730
 on the engine and the 211 1.0 liter is the double 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.830
 cooling circuit and allows 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.760
 different temperatures for the block and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.650
 for the head and the 211 1.0 liter is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
 also the country's first engine in this 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.390
 displacement range receiving system 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.459
 cold start and does not require 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.459
 of the auxiliary tank for gasoline 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.670
 fox 1.0 blue motion combines the 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.430
 characteristics of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.530
 fuel and energy efficiency. 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.480
 surprising performance for a model 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.750
 of this displacement range when 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.430
 fueled with 1.0 liter fox 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.060
 bruno china accelerates from 0 to 100 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.910
 kilometers per hour in 13.5 seconds and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.660
 reaches a maximum speed of 166 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.760
 kilometers per hour with ethanol are 13.2 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.000
 seconds for acceleration from 0 to 100 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 kilometers per hour and 167 kilometers 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 per hour of maximum speed 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.769
 bluemotion technology also applies 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.170
 the mechanics and aesthetics of fox always with 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.480
 focus on fuel economy 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.060
 the electro-hydraulic steering feature 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.850
 offered as standard on the model reduces 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 consumption by 3% when compared to the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 hydraulic steering 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.630
 the transmission had elongated relationships 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.760
 by up to 10% compared to that used in the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.950
 fox 1.0 liter 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.870
 the measure was made possible thanks to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.420
 higher torque arrangement at low 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.160
 rotation schemes and this makes the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.100
 drive at lower engine speeds 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.380
 the same speeds resulting in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.859
 lower fuel consumption and lower 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.859
 emissions 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.990
 aerodynamics of fox bluemotion was 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.110
 developed and certified in tunnel of 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.210
 wind every detail including the drawing 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.630
 was designed with the objective of 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.670
 to minimize aerodynamic drag to 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.490
 top grille are in the shape of a 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.440
 differentiated with exclusive design and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.810
 narrower apertures 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.030
 the lower grid had its profile in the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.890
 also altered allowing 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.230
 increased air flow 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.780
 this model uses low 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.390
 green called rolling resistance 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.060
 with the increase in the application of silica in 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.010
 its composition the new model also 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.200
 received improvements in acoustic comfort 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.750
 with the use of larger 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.420
 mufflers in the exhaust system and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.420
 insulation blanket on the body when the 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.210
 all fox bluemotion is 29 pounds over 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.340
 lightweight than the 1.0 liter version, which 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:31.640
 also contributes to lower consumption of 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:34.190
 fuel as a serial
