cloth only let the dough rise by half

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.330 
cloth only let the dough rise by half
shape<00:06:13.760> it<00:06:14.000> then<00:06:14.630> again<00:06:15.050> let<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.410> rise<00:06:15.710> by<00:06:15.980> half

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
shape it then again let it rise by half

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.450 
shape it then again let it rise by half
and<00:06:16.700> bake<00:06:17.120> it<00:06:17.360> do<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.350> every<00:06:18.860> recipe<00:06:19.220> you

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
and bake it do that and every recipe you

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.970 
and bake it do that and every recipe you
use<00:06:19.790> will<00:06:20.270> work<00:06:20.570> because<00:06:20.870> you're<00:06:21.530> keeping<00:06:21.860> the

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
use will work because you're keeping the

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.980 
use will work because you're keeping the
dough<00:06:22.130> young<00:06:22.430> then<00:06:22.820> from<00:06:23.090> this<00:06:23.360> point<00:06:23.690> all<00:06:23.930> we

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
dough young then from this point all we

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.960 
dough young then from this point all we
need<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.620> do<00:06:24.740> is<00:06:24.890> think<00:06:25.190> about<00:06:25.280> how<00:06:25.760> we're

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
need to do is think about how we're

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.670 
need to do is think about how we're
going<00:06:26.090> to<00:06:26.150> finish<00:06:26.330> it<00:06:26.450> we<00:06:26.870> could<00:06:27.110> press<00:06:27.500> the

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
going to finish it we could press the

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.620 
going to finish it we could press the
dough<00:06:27.830> out<00:06:28.010> into<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.340> focaccia<00:06:28.700> we<00:06:29.120> can<00:06:29.270> chop<00:06:29.480> it

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
dough out into a focaccia we can chop it

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.660 
dough out into a focaccia we can chop it
up<00:06:29.720> make<00:06:30.140> little<00:06:30.440> rolls<00:06:30.650> but<00:06:31.100> what<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.310> thought

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
up make little rolls but what I thought

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.670 
up make little rolls but what I thought
might<00:06:32.000> be<00:06:32.030> good<00:06:32.180> is<00:06:32.660> if<00:06:32.870> we<00:06:32.990> try<00:06:33.230> and<00:06:33.350> do<00:06:33.440> a<00:06:33.470> loaf

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
might be good is if we try and do a loaf

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.410 
might be good is if we try and do a loaf
just<00:06:33.710> like<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.280> one<00:06:34.490> we<00:06:34.760> saw<00:06:34.940> at<00:06:34.970> movida

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
just like the one we saw at movida

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.990 
just like the one we saw at movida
bakery<00:06:35.900> lemon<00:06:36.560> shaped<00:06:36.890> with<00:06:37.130> a<00:06:37.190> big<00:06:37.400> cut<00:06:37.760> down

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
bakery lemon shaped with a big cut down

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.060 
bakery lemon shaped with a big cut down
the<00:06:38.120> middle<00:06:38.210> that'll<00:06:38.960> look<00:06:39.080> great<00:06:39.290> this<00:06:39.770> dough

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
the middle that'll look great this dough

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.790 
the middle that'll look great this dough
will<00:06:40.250> be<00:06:40.370> perfect<00:06:40.970> for<00:06:41.060> this<00:06:41.330> so<00:06:42.200> the<00:06:42.560> dough

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
will be perfect for this so the dough

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.190 
will be perfect for this so the dough
has<00:06:43.070> risen<00:06:43.310> by<00:06:43.610> half<00:06:43.850> and<00:06:44.150> all<00:06:44.720> we<00:06:44.810> need<00:06:44.990> to<00:06:45.080> do

has risen by half and all we need to do

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.430 
has risen by half and all we need to do
is<00:06:45.470> shape<00:06:45.740> it<00:06:45.950> take<00:06:46.400> a<00:06:46.430> bit<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.640> flour<00:06:47.290> throw<00:06:48.290> it

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
is shape it take a bit of flour throw it
