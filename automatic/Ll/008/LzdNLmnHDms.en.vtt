diagram of the wrist bones so the rest
is<00:00:44.309> made<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> eight<00:00:45.690> bones<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.100> don't

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
is made up of eight bones now I don't

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.950 
is made up of eight bones now I don't
have<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> mains<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> bones<00:00:48.390> written<00:00:48.750> here

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
have the mains of the bones written here

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
have the mains of the bones written here
but<00:00:49.170> there's<00:00:50.160> four<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.750> three

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but there's four on top one two three

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.490 
but there's four on top one two three
four<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.399> there's<00:00:53.640> four<00:00:54.149> below<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:55.230> two

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
four and then there's four below one two

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
four and then there's four below one two
three<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.350> which<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
three and then this one here which I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.459 
three and then this one here which I
consider<00:00:58.829> below<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> depends<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.750> how<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
consider below so it depends on how you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
consider below so it depends on how you
look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.129> there's<00:01:02.309> eight<00:01:02.520> bones<00:01:02.850> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
look at it but there's eight bones in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.549 
look at it but there's eight bones in
there<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> looks<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.260> they're<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there now it looks like they're just

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
there now it looks like they're just
thrown<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.250> randomly<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.570> not

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
thrown in there randomly but that's not

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
thrown in there randomly but that's not
the<00:01:06.900> case<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:08.909> are

the case at all the way that they are
positioned<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.159> they

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.230 
communication going on here a
relationship<00:01:57.119> between<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.079> wrist<00:01:58.469> bones

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
relationship between the wrist bones

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.870 
relationship between the wrist bones
that<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.359> here<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.890> four<00:02:02.130> are<00:02:02.310> moments<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that are here the four are moments and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
that are here the four are moments and
also<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.689> thumb<00:02:03.959> and<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.319> finger<00:02:04.649> bones<00:02:04.890> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
also the thumb and the finger bones so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
also the thumb and the finger bones so
you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:05.959> or<00:02:06.959> if<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> look<00:02:07.319> at<00:02:07.409> any<00:02:07.590> other

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you can see or if you look at any other

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.580 
you can see or if you look at any other
diagrams<00:02:08.700> online<00:02:09.209> you'll<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
diagrams online you'll see that all of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.289 
diagrams online you'll see that all of
these<00:02:10.739> kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> fit<00:02:11.459> together<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.180> puzzle

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
these kind of fit together like a puzzle

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.990 
these kind of fit together like a puzzle
and<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.950> get<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.489> these<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.849> of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and if you get one of these out of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.589 
and if you get one of these out of
alignment

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
alignment

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.000 
alignment
then<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.989> can<00:02:16.140> cause<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> great<00:02:16.530> deal<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
then it can cause a great deal of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.520 
then it can cause a great deal of
pressure<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.489> discomfort<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.060> your<00:02:18.180> training

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
pressure and discomfort in your training

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.259 
pressure and discomfort in your training
so<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.190> talk<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> about<00:02:20.819> three

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
so I want to talk to you about three

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.819 
so I want to talk to you about three
ways<00:02:21.480> where<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> keep<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.380> alignment

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
ways where you can keep this alignment

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:23.839 
ways where you can keep this alignment
correct

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
correct

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.350 
correct
so<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> first<00:02:25.079> off<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.769> first<00:02:26.519> one<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.910> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
so the first off the first one is to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
so the first off the first one is to
warm<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.810> properly<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:29.040> got<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.370> go<00:02:29.489> through<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
warm up properly you got to go through a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.089 
warm up properly you got to go through a
nice<00:02:30.000> full-body<00:02:30.510> warmup<00:02:30.780> working<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.069> your

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
nice full-body warmup working up to your

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.160 
nice full-body warmup working up to your
hands<00:02:32.700> starting<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.629> legs<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.019> then

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
hands starting with the legs and then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.650 
hands starting with the legs and then
working<00:02:34.379> out<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.950> extremities<00:02:35.879> in<00:02:36.150> order

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
working out to the extremities in order

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.050 
working out to the extremities in order
to<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:36.870> some<00:02:37.019> blood<00:02:37.230> flow<00:02:37.500> going<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.819> get

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
to get some blood flow going and to get

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.900 
to get some blood flow going and to get
the<00:02:39.299> soft<00:02:39.569> tissues<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.739> pliable<00:02:41.310> they're

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the soft tissues more pliable they're

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.069 
the soft tissues more pliable they're
going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.390> flexible<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.930> way

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
going to be more flexible that way

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.199 
going to be more flexible that way
they're<00:02:43.709> gonna<00:02:43.829> respond<00:02:44.250> better<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.610> training

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
they're gonna respond better to training

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.720 
they're gonna respond better to training
an<00:02:46.019> example<00:02:46.590> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.829> just<00:02:46.980> jump<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.519> bench

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
an example if you just jump on the bench

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.000 
an example if you just jump on the bench
press<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.480> absolutely<00:02:49.049> no<00:02:49.230> warm-up<00:02:49.650> at<00:02:49.829> all

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
press with absolutely no warm-up at all

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.680 
press with absolutely no warm-up at all
your<00:02:50.370> hands<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.790> going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.090> cold<00:02:51.359> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
your hands are going to be cold and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.720 
your hands are going to be cold and
they're<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.799> stepped<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.609> they

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
they're going to be stepped because they

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.129 
they're going to be stepped because they
don't<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.299> blood<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.989> help

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
don't have the blood in there to help

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.559 
don't have the blood in there to help
them<00:02:55.380> stay<00:02:55.980> nice<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.250> flexible<00:02:56.790> apply<00:02:57.209> them

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
them stay nice and flexible apply them

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.590 
them stay nice and flexible apply them
so<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.829> go<00:02:59.040> through<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> warm-up<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.450> can

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so if you go through a warm-up you can

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.090 
so if you go through a warm-up you can
help<00:03:00.780> yourself<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.350> great

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
help yourself out great

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.539 
help yourself out great
the<00:03:02.790> next<00:03:03.180> thing<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.590> stretch

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
the next thing is you want to stretch

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.690 
the next thing is you want to stretch
between<00:03:05.819> sets<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:07.290> especially<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.579> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
between sets because especially with the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.370 
between sets because especially with the
bench<00:03:08.849> press<00:03:09.120> where<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.170> much

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
bench press where you have so much

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.520 
bench press where you have so much
pressure<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:11.280> your<00:03:11.609> hands<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.870> going<00:03:13.349> to

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
pressure on your hands this is going to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.180 
pressure on your hands this is going to
create<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.579> situation<00:03:14.819> where<00:03:15.950> where<00:03:16.950> things

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
create a situation where where things

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190 
create a situation where where things
can<00:03:17.370> get<00:03:17.549> out<00:03:17.609> of<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> line<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:19.169> that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
can get out of the line so because that

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.839 
can get out of the line so because that
pressure<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.430> want<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.669> be

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
pressure is there you don't want to be

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.640 
pressure is there you don't want to be
retaining<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.630> pressure<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.989> between<00:03:22.109> sets

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
retaining that pressure in between sets

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.449 
retaining that pressure in between sets
you<00:03:23.519> want<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.819> go<00:03:23.940> through<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.720> few<00:03:25.049> easy

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
you want to go through just a few easy

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.800 
you want to go through just a few easy
stretches<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.819> just<00:03:27.000> keep<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.359> blood<00:03:27.599> flowing

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
stretches to just keep the blood flowing

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.289 
stretches to just keep the blood flowing
through<00:03:28.319> there<00:03:28.560> get<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.980> waste<00:03:29.220> out<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.819> then

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
through there get the waste out and then

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.050 
through there get the waste out and then
to<00:03:30.510> promote<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:31.200> alignment<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.819> one

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to promote this alignment so the one

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.030 
to promote this alignment so the one
stretch<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.750> do<00:03:33.810> several<00:03:34.349> times<00:03:34.680> through

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
stretch that I do several times through

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.909 
stretch that I do several times through
each<00:03:35.220> workout<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:37.109> as<00:03:37.260> well<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
each workout that you can do as well and

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.830 
each workout that you can do as well and
I<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.250> hold<00:03:38.400> this

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
I just hold this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.360 
I just hold this
we<00:03:38.930> need<00:03:39.080> four<00:03:39.319> or<00:03:39.440> five<00:03:39.590> seconds<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.130> night

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
we need four or five seconds a night

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.080 
we need four or five seconds a night
switch<00:03:40.970> hands<00:03:41.239> go<00:03:41.630> back<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.050> next<00:03:42.230> set<00:03:42.500> is

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
switch hands go back to the next set is

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.089 
switch hands go back to the next set is
just<00:03:44.090> take<00:03:44.270> one<00:03:44.510> hand<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.650> take<00:03:45.830> your<00:03:46.010> other

just take one hand you take your other

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.670 
just take one hand you take your other
hand<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.700> put<00:03:47.450> your<00:03:47.569> hand<00:03:47.780> inside<00:03:48.170> their

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
hand you put your hand inside their

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.820 
hand you put your hand inside their
middle<00:03:48.980> finger<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.700> your<00:03:49.880> ring<00:03:49.910> finger<00:03:50.830> hook

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
middle finger and your ring finger hook

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.600 
middle finger and your ring finger hook
over<00:03:52.160> your<00:03:52.310> thumb<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.849> then<00:03:53.330> just<00:03:53.540> gradually

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
over your thumb and then just gradually

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.670 
over your thumb and then just gradually
strengthen<00:03:55.610> your<00:03:55.730> arm<00:03:55.940> out<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:57.260> what<00:03:57.500> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
strengthen your arm out and what this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.040 
strengthen your arm out and what this
does<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.700> see<00:03:58.970> this<00:03:59.150> this

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
does is you can see this this

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.509 
does is you can see this this
accomplishes<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.769> lot<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.069> things

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
accomplishes a lot of things

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.520 
accomplishes a lot of things
it<00:04:01.700> stretches<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.510> part<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.230> hand<00:04:03.380> very

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it stretches this part of the hand very

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.640 
it stretches this part of the hand very
well<00:04:03.950> out<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:05.060> opens<00:04:05.510> up<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.840> wrist<00:04:06.110> keeps

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
well out it opens up the wrist keeps

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.900 
well out it opens up the wrist keeps
everything<00:04:07.099> flowing<00:04:07.610> through<00:04:08.180> their<00:04:08.390> blood

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
everything flowing through their blood

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.020 
everything flowing through their blood
and<00:04:10.910> then<00:04:11.090> also<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.600> nerve<00:04:12.310> impulses<00:04:13.310> flow

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and then also your nerve impulses flow

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.789 
and then also your nerve impulses flow
into<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.540> hands<00:04:14.900> better<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.410> way

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
into the hands better that way

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.039 
into the hands better that way
plus<00:04:16.250> you're<00:04:16.940> stretching<00:04:17.359> out<00:04:17.600> your<00:04:17.810> whole

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
plus you're stretching out your whole

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.680 
plus you're stretching out your whole
entire<00:04:18.139> form<00:04:18.680> so<00:04:18.889> this<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.130> like<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> really

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
entire form so this is like a really

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.040 
entire form so this is like a really
high-impact<00:04:21.970> stretch<00:04:22.970> for<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.510> because<00:04:23.870> it's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
high-impact stretch for you because it's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.230 
high-impact stretch for you because it's
getting<00:04:24.229> so<00:04:24.620> much<00:04:24.889> stuff<00:04:25.220> done<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:26.060> really

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
getting so much stuff done and it really

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.909 
getting so much stuff done and it really
won't<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.540> takes<00:04:26.720> like<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:26.960> four<00:04:27.290> or<00:04:27.320> five<00:04:27.530> cycle

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
won't it takes like a four or five cycle

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.540 
won't it takes like a four or five cycle
hold<00:04:28.130> as<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:29.300> maintenance<00:04:30.050> stretch<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.070> between

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
hold as a maintenance stretch in between

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.590 
hold as a maintenance stretch in between
sets<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.010> next<00:04:34.430> thing<00:04:34.580> they<00:04:35.090> need<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.450> do

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
sets now the next thing they need to do

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.690 
sets now the next thing they need to do
and<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.380> probably<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.919> most<00:04:37.070> important

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
and this is probably the most important

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.000 
and this is probably the most important
of<00:04:37.729> all<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.350> be<00:04:39.470> aware<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.770> your

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
of all is you have to be aware of your

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.969 
of all is you have to be aware of your
technique<00:04:40.460> on<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.630> bench<00:04:41.870> press<00:04:42.229> you<00:04:42.620> must

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
technique on the bench press you must

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.969 
technique on the bench press you must
try<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.850> keep<00:04:44.360> your<00:04:44.720> wrist<00:04:45.080> as<00:04:45.380> straight<00:04:45.800> as

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
try to keep your wrist as straight as

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.250 
try to keep your wrist as straight as
possible<00:04:46.270> now<00:04:47.270> your<00:04:47.450> hand<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.810> going<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.050> bend

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
possible now your hand is going to bend

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.990 
possible now your hand is going to bend
back<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:49.039> slightly<00:04:49.160> just<00:04:49.490> because<00:04:49.880> that's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
back just slightly just because that's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.430 
back just slightly just because that's
the<00:04:50.150> way<00:04:50.240> your<00:04:50.390> hand<00:04:50.600> is<00:04:50.720> made<00:04:50.930> up<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.169> you're

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
the way your hand is made up and you're

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.080 
the way your hand is made up and you're
gonna<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.800> bar<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.370> there<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:52.760> it's<00:04:52.910> going

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
gonna have a bar in there so it's going

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.180 
gonna have a bar in there so it's going
to<00:04:53.150> look<00:04:53.210> like<00:04:53.419> this<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:54.500> what<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.830> want<00:04:55.070> to

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
to look like this but what you want to

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.400 
to look like this but what you want to
avoid<00:04:55.520> is<00:04:55.910> some<00:04:56.270> kind<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.570> risk<00:04:56.780> positioning

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
avoid is some kind of risk positioning

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.770 
avoid is some kind of risk positioning
where<00:04:57.950> your<00:04:58.190> hand<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.640> bent<00:04:58.910> way<00:04:59.300> back<00:04:59.600> like

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
where your hand is bent way back like

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.360 
where your hand is bent way back like
this<00:05:00.370> now<00:05:01.570> there<00:05:02.570> is<00:05:02.810> value<00:05:03.169> in<00:05:03.710> being<00:05:04.039> able<00:05:04.190> to

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
this now there is value in being able to

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.620 
this now there is value in being able to
grip<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.910> bar<00:05:05.060> tightly<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:07.360> because<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.510> will

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
grip the bar tightly and because it will

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.070 
grip the bar tightly and because it will
increase<00:05:09.020> your<00:05:09.080> your<00:05:09.710> weights<00:05:09.950> lifted

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
increase your your weights lifted

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.810 
increase your your weights lifted
sometimes<00:05:12.080> when<00:05:12.320> people<00:05:12.350> do<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.700> I'll

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
sometimes when people do that and I'll

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.000 
sometimes when people do that and I'll
take<00:05:14.030> my<00:05:14.180> marker<00:05:14.419> when<00:05:15.350> they<00:05:15.470> do<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.830> they

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
take my marker when they do that they

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.250 
take my marker when they do that they
place<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.430> part<00:05:16.669> bar<00:05:17.090> too<00:05:17.450> far<00:05:17.690> back<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.110> their

place the part bar too far back in their
hand<00:05:18.820> remember<00:05:19.820> you're<00:05:19.940> gonna<00:05:20.030> be<00:05:20.150> veteran
