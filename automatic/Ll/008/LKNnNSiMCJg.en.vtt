 once you sign up I'm going 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.420

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.370
 reservation in case some do not show up 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.379
 because then it happens that some do not 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.000
 present or could not because of the schedule 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.629

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.709
 that this is going to be randomly 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.850
 I'm going to choose anyone not 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.590
 it means that because you have 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.690
 subscribed just a minute ago I'm not going 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.300

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.420

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.320

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.840
