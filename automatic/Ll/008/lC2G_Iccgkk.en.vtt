00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.900
I was born into a great peasant family

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:23.901
Roberto - Artisanal Ice-cream maker
and there was a very and exceptionnal great food

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.802
I had four aunts who cooked from morning to evening.

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:28.503
So I knew the true real cooking,

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:30.204
the true pastries and cakes,

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.305
the homemade bread

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:36.806
and all this beautiful and natural products of the countryside.

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:41.207
Then I told myself, why not continue the tradition

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.108
and make very good things ?

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.509
They are very good and delicate

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
Hum, his ice-creams...

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.711
I really love all of his ice creams.

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:14.012
That's delicious

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.113
They are great

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:16.114
- Here it is better
- Yes

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:18.615
In other places i have taken the same flavors

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:21.116
and for example, we smelled less the taste of the chocolate

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:34.517
There has only natural and fresh products

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:39.618
The fruit sorbets are made with natural and true fruits

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.619
and ice creams are only made with fresh milk

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.820
and with the highest products

00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:39.821
Sure, it must love its work,

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:41.522
otherwise it's wasted time,

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:46.523
you have to put a lot of love in your ice cream,

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:50.524
in all the things you do,

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.625
and be especially attentive to the quality
