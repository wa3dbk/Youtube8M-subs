cars are going how far they get

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.710 
cars are going how far they get
car<00:01:05.979> gets<00:01:06.220> real<00:01:06.520> loose<00:01:06.790> right<00:01:07.119> there<00:01:07.390> he's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
car gets real loose right there he's

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.530 
car gets real loose right there he's
fighting<00:01:08.170> for<00:01:08.200> control<00:01:08.500> goes<00:01:09.460> up<00:01:09.759> smacks<00:01:10.330> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
fighting for control goes up smacks the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.660 
fighting for control goes up smacks the
wall<00:01:10.720> cuts<00:01:11.350> out<00:01:11.560> very<00:01:11.890> hard<00:01:12.220> on<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.610> left

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
wall cuts out very hard on that left

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.310 
wall cuts out very hard on that left
rear<00:01:13.030> corner<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:13.450> think<00:01:13.720> that's<00:01:13.990> where<00:01:14.200> it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
rear corner I think that's where it

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320 
rear corner I think that's where it
snaps<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> hub<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.280> think<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.940> snapped<00:01:16.210> it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
snaps the hub I think it snapped it

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.669 
snaps the hub I think it snapped it
there<00:01:16.479> too<00:01:16.720> but<00:01:16.869> I'd<00:01:16.990> say<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.170> think<00:01:17.350> something

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
there too but I'd say I think something

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.830 
there too but I'd say I think something
broke<00:01:17.860> too<00:01:18.700> cause<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:18.940> car<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.570> loose

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
broke too cause that car to get loose

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.779 
broke too cause that car to get loose
like<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.500> then<00:01:20.590> he<00:01:20.710> lost<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.190> that's

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
like that and then he lost it that's

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.150 
like that and then he lost it that's
that's<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.470> strange<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.649> see<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> car<00:01:24.130> like
