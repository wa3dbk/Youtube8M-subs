to go around and close and one of the
questions<00:00:39.370> I<00:00:39.670> was<00:00:39.790> asked<00:00:40.120> me<00:00:40.210> by<00:00:40.390> mr.<00:00:41.110> bill

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
questions I was asked me by mr. bill

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.210 
questions I was asked me by mr. bill
troop<00:00:41.970> 1973<00:00:42.970> was<00:00:43.150> if<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.600> could<00:00:43.660> mount<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.410> in

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
troop 1973 was if I could mount it in

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.010 
troop 1973 was if I could mount it in
the<00:00:45.880> slots<00:00:46.360> here<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.010> yes<00:00:48.280> it<00:00:48.430> can<00:00:48.610> be<00:00:48.760> done

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the slots here and yes it can be done

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.480 
the slots here and yes it can be done
but<00:00:50.020> one<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.260> my<00:00:50.410> concerns<00:00:50.830> was<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.190> it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
but one of my concerns was that it

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.970 
but one of my concerns was that it
doesn't<00:00:51.850> tighten<00:00:52.690> down<00:00:52.990> as<00:00:53.230> tight<00:00:53.470> as<00:00:53.650> I<00:00:53.770> liked

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
doesn't tighten down as tight as I liked

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.860 
doesn't tighten down as tight as I liked
it<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.460> can<00:00:54.700> ride<00:00:54.970> up<00:00:55.240> and<00:00:55.780> I'll

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
it and it can ride up and I'll

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.160 
it and it can ride up and I'll
demonstrate<00:00:56.110> that<00:00:56.620> my<00:00:57.460> concern<00:00:57.850> was<00:00:58.060> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
demonstrate that my concern was that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.020 
demonstrate that my concern was that
when<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.320> does<00:00:59.500> ride<00:00:59.740> up<00:00:59.980> if<00:01:00.490> you<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.880> it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
when it does ride up if you have it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.859 
when it does ride up if you have it
closed<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:05.920> does<00:01:06.100> ride<00:01:06.340> up<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.630> knife

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
closed when it does ride up the knife

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.340 
closed when it does ride up the knife
rides<00:01:08.200> up<00:01:08.439> with<00:01:08.649> it<00:01:08.859> and<00:01:09.899> exposes<00:01:10.899> part<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
rides up with it and exposes part of the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.950 
rides up with it and exposes part of the
blade<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.299> didn't<00:01:13.630> thoroughly

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
blade but I didn't thoroughly

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.200 
blade but I didn't thoroughly
investigate<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.979> what<00:01:15.429> happened<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.969> even

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
investigate and what happened is even

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.649 
investigate and what happened is even
though<00:01:16.929> part<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.859> the<00:01:17.920> blade<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.249> exposed<00:01:18.850> this

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
though part of the blade is exposed this

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.929 
though part of the blade is exposed this
knife<00:01:20.020> has<00:01:20.259> what<00:01:20.499> we<00:01:20.530> call<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:21.159> knife<00:01:21.549> trap

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
knife has what we call a knife trap

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.120 
knife has what we call a knife trap
which<00:01:22.719> means<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.200> not<00:01:23.289> sharp<00:01:23.649> right<00:01:23.859> here<00:01:24.039> on

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
which means it's not sharp right here on

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.489 
which means it's not sharp right here on
it's<00:01:24.340> part<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.819> blade<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.350> is

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
it's part of the blade so that it is

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.160 
it's part of the blade so that it is
safe<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.130> it's<00:01:27.280> really<00:01:27.460> not<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.700> concern<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.899> can

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
safe so it's really not a concern it can

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.620 
safe so it's really not a concern it can
be<00:01:29.319> mounted<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.829> this<00:01:30.009> position<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.759> even

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
be mounted in this position and even

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.749 
be mounted in this position and even
though<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.840> rides<00:01:32.049> up<00:01:32.289> is<00:01:33.130> still<00:01:33.490> going<00:01:33.639> to<00:01:33.700> be

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
though it rides up is still going to be

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.590 
though it rides up is still going to be
secure<00:01:35.429> and<00:01:36.429> it<00:01:36.579> will<00:01:36.729> be<00:01:36.880> safe<00:01:37.149> you're<00:01:37.479> not

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
secure and it will be safe you're not

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.669 
secure and it will be safe you're not
going<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.780> cut<00:01:37.929> your<00:01:38.020> finger<00:01:38.319> when<00:01:38.439> you<00:01:38.499> go<00:01:38.619> to

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
going to cut your finger when you go to

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.160 
going to cut your finger when you go to
grab<00:01:38.920> your<00:01:39.069> knife<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.420> here's<00:01:40.749> another<00:01:40.960> thing

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
grab your knife but here's another thing

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.429 
grab your knife but here's another thing
I<00:01:41.289> discovered<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:43.270> through<00:01:43.929> playing<00:01:44.319> with

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
I discovered that through playing with

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.059 
I discovered that through playing with
this<00:01:44.649> knife<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.100> working<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:47.439> sheath

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
this knife and working with this sheath

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.399 
this knife and working with this sheath
actually<00:01:48.549> stretched<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.359> lot<00:01:49.929> more<00:01:50.170> than<00:01:50.380> I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
actually stretched a lot more than I

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.919 
actually stretched a lot more than I
thought<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.770> would<00:01:50.889> and<00:01:51.359> what<00:01:52.359> I<00:01:52.420> found<00:01:52.719> that

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
thought it would and what I found that

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.260 
thought it would and what I found that
through<00:01:53.709> really<00:01:53.979> playing<00:01:54.399> with<00:01:54.579> this<00:01:54.759> thing<00:01:54.819> I

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
through really playing with this thing I

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.139 
through really playing with this thing I
don't<00:01:55.719> know<00:01:55.899> if<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.109> was<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:56.259> my<00:01:56.649> sheath<00:01:57.149> but

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
don't know if it was just my sheath but

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.999 
don't know if it was just my sheath but
it<00:01:58.299> seemed<00:01:58.509> like<00:01:58.539> I<00:01:58.929> mean<00:01:59.289> it<00:01:59.529> literally<00:01:59.859> was

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
it seemed like I mean it literally was

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.999 
it seemed like I mean it literally was
at<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.450> point<00:02:01.779> where<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:01.959> would<00:02:02.409> not<00:02:02.619> close

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
at this point where it would not close

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.969 
at this point where it would not close
it<00:02:03.279> was<00:02:03.369> over<00:02:03.609> this<00:02:03.759> plastic<00:02:04.270> piece<00:02:04.509> here<00:02:04.979> okay

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
it was over this plastic piece here okay

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.400 
it was over this plastic piece here okay
so<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:07.149> playing<00:02:07.509> with<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.020> playing<00:02:08.229> with

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
so by playing with this and playing with

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.350 
so by playing with this and playing with
this<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.979> actually<00:02:09.369> stretched<00:02:09.729> out<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.209> to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
this it actually stretched out and up to

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.860 
this it actually stretched out and up to
that<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.869> where<00:02:10.990> now<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.319> can<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.720> that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that to where now I can actually in that

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.649 
that to where now I can actually in that
position<00:02:14.110> close<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.280> catch<00:02:15.760> point<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
position close the catch point so it

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.559 
position close the catch point so it
does<00:02:16.870> work<00:02:18.060> another<00:02:19.060> thing<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.330> want<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
does work another thing I want to

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.179 
does work another thing I want to
mention<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:20.019> once<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.620> switch<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
mention that once you switch it to the

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.990 
mention that once you switch it to the
ambidextrous<00:02:22.000> position<00:02:22.629> for<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.379> left-hander

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
ambidextrous position for a left-hander

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.199 
ambidextrous position for a left-hander
it<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.180> does<00:02:25.540> become<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.019> thumb<00:02:27.010> release<00:02:27.340> which

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it now does become a thumb release which

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.520 
it now does become a thumb release which
is<00:02:28.390> how<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:28.659> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> use<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.230> knife

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
is how I'm going to use this knife

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.360 
is how I'm going to use this knife
sheath<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.659> left<00:02:31.870> hand<00:02:32.110> position<00:02:32.370> for

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
sheath in the left hand position for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.509 
sheath in the left hand position for
left-hander<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.620> release<00:02:36.250> this

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
left-hander and so I can release this

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.119 
left-hander and so I can release this
knife<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.269> thumb<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:39.040> is

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
knife with the thumb and there is

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.000 
knife with the thumb and there is
another<00:02:39.340> thing<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.730> was<00:02:39.970> mentioned<00:02:40.420> about

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
another thing that was mentioned about

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.039 
another thing that was mentioned about
just<00:02:42.010> cutting<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.549> piece<00:02:42.610> off<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.930> was

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
just cutting this piece off that was

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
just cutting this piece off that was
this<00:02:44.319> knife<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.890> do<00:02:44.950> not<00:02:45.280> recommend<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.879> at

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
this knife I do not recommend that at

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.770 
this knife I do not recommend that at
all<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:47.170> without<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.860> piece<00:02:48.780> this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
all because without that piece this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.100 
all because without that piece this
knife<00:02:50.049> just<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.680> does<00:02:50.950> fall<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:51.610> out<00:02:52.110> now

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
knife just it does fall right out now

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.550 
knife just it does fall right out now
there<00:02:53.319> are<00:02:53.439> other<00:02:53.650> knife<00:02:53.980> sheaths<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:55.560> will

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
there are other knife sheaths that will

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.679 
there are other knife sheaths that will
secure<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:58.090> example<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:59.709> knife<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.540> can

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
secure for example this knife you can

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.110 
secure for example this knife you can
get<00:03:01.870> rid<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.760> piece<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:05.489> there's<00:03:06.489> no<00:03:06.849> way

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
get rid of this piece and there's no way

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.839 
get rid of this piece and there's no way
I<00:03:07.620> mean<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.920> carry<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.670> around

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
I mean you can carry this around

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.640 
I mean you can carry this around
upside-down<00:03:10.329> all<00:03:10.719> day<00:03:10.870> long<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.349> not

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
upside-down all day long and it's not

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.440 
upside-down all day long and it's not
coming<00:03:11.950> out<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.610> because<00:03:12.939> it<00:03:13.060> has<00:03:13.180> such

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
coming out and it's because it has such

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.729 
coming out and it's because it has such
a<00:03:13.599> strong<00:03:13.930> thumb<00:03:14.290> release<00:03:14.620> right<00:03:14.860> here<00:03:16.739> it's

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
a strong thumb release right here it's

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.569 
a strong thumb release right here it's
very<00:03:17.799> very<00:03:18.280> tight<00:03:18.819> on<00:03:19.060> release<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.430> can

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
very very tight on release and you can

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.920 
very very tight on release and you can
see<00:03:21.760> how<00:03:21.879> much<00:03:22.090> pressure<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.409> there

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
see how much pressure is in there

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.970 
see how much pressure is in there
there's<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.019> lot<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.290> pressure<00:03:26.500> holding<00:03:26.890> this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
there's a lot of pressure holding this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.099 
there's a lot of pressure holding this
knife<00:03:27.189> in<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.269> with<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.569> knife<00:03:28.780> sheath

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109

knife in so with this knife sheath
that's<00:03:29.829> very<00:03:30.159> similar<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:31.299> can<00:03:31.450> do<00:03:31.599> it

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
that's very similar you can do it

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.130 
that's very similar you can do it
this<00:03:33.129> knife<00:03:33.430> sheath<00:03:33.760> absolutely<00:03:34.569> not<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.959> see

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
there's there's no pressure at all

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.679 
there's there's no pressure at all
holding<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:36.939> knife<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:39.359> would<00:03:40.359> not<00:03:40.540> walk

knowledge that I don't have to help me

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.479 
knowledge that I don't have to help me
out<00:04:04.540> also<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.590> thanks<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.920> lot<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.359> my<00:04:07.359> piece<00:04:08.489> so

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
out also so thanks a lot and my piece so

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.130 
out also so thanks a lot and my piece so
it<00:04:09.579> did<00:04:09.700> hold<00:04:09.849> my<00:04:10.030> finger<00:04:10.329> on<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.719> here

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
it did hold my finger on the back here

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.160 
it did hold my finger on the back here
and<00:04:11.349> I'm<00:04:11.439> tighten<00:04:11.829> them<00:04:11.920> as<00:04:12.609> well<00:04:12.909> as<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.599> can

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.779 

and<00:04:17.170> what<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.530> find<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.010> they<00:04:18.340> do<00:04:18.400> spin

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
and what I find is that they do spin

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.680 
and what I find is that they do spin
still<00:04:21.789> so<00:04:22.449> there<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.780> some

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
still so there is some
