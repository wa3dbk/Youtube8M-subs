00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.090
 speaks guys left on the scoreboard today are 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:21.830
 there to teach the flip cross is me and it 's from 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.830
 site lainey hai 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.710
 to learn the main crouch clip 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.230
 this maneuver you know the flip is a 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.540
 center quite below the flip 7 km 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.460
 enough at the time you throw it at 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.900
 fashion are you sure that he will 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.879
 upload right 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.730
 after that you learn the dealer 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.600
 you learning crush will make it easier 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 70% of the maneuver you know in those two that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.170
 Then you already start the flip attempts . 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:00.320
 crook without putting the front foot one 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.070
 little behind the screw and operate brings 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.170
 more full tail and there you will come a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.350
 little diagonal of the stage 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.490
 There you will make that same impact. 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.490
 Ugly but such a flip will try to do with 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.740
 that he sends that he leaves had and for him already 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.140
 it's diagonal that does not need the flip 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.940
 or crooked is to have the same grandson Felipe 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 that it will already fit the crux you already 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.310
 is jammed into the ball by placing the foot 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.700
 well even in the center of the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.020
 new to you to control the croup and 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.020
 slide it all the way 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.640
 He is from behind and it is good that he stays always. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.409
 in that measure screw eggs 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.149
 because if he stays a little longer 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.149
 up will make it harder for you to leave 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.600
 and then you will only get out of it that is successful 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.649
 The tip I'm going to tell you is that I 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.400
 also uses in the clip kruchin is that the hour 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.870
 that backflip here I well stretch it 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.569
 is shrinking the back leg and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 trying to put the whole weight on the foot in the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.970
 in front of him he'd even stuck to the edge 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.640
 because he's nailing you 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.970
 can get more control of it and there 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 it's just you slip and by the end and the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.900
 ripped out 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.450
 I hope you learn and stay 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.130
 Look at the channel, warm life you're going to see. 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.510
 several other maneuvers and also to 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.580
 you learn 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:05.650
 this is it there we milk light just a test 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:18.790
 just a flip group of skate life and there that 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:24.670
 more if the action will get left in 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:36.310
 or Miranga al damn 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:37.300
 the guy is tuning blind posture and last 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.960
 south time 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:49.590
 the word disappeared in the head but the foot in the 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.590
 general time Phlips then
