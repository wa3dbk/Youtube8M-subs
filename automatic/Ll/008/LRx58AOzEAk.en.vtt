00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
we are playing Super Mario Brothers 2

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.380 
we are playing Super Mario Brothers 2
for<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> NES<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.809> playing<00:00:37.170> level<00:00:38.100> 1<00:00:38.640> 3

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
for the NES and I'm playing level 1 3

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
for the NES and I'm playing level 1 3
which<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> third<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.610> final

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
which is actually the third and final

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
which is actually the third and final
final<00:00:42.600> level<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> world<00:00:43.379> 1<00:00:45.350> somehow<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.500> got

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
final level of world 1 somehow I got

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.420 
final level of world 1 somehow I got
stuck<00:00:46.980> fighting<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> boss<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.190> actually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
stuck fighting the boss but I actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
stuck fighting the boss but I actually
think<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> boss<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.180> level<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> kind<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
think the boss in this level is kind of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
think the boss in this level is kind of
fun<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.199> ok<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.420> what<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
fun so it's ok not like what is it the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
fun so it's ok not like what is it the
crab<00:00:54.930> monster<00:00:55.530> later<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> game<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.640> not

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
because I think he's the best used to be

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.130 
because I think he's the best used to be
a<00:02:09.790> big<00:02:09.940> fan<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.119> Luigi<00:02:10.600> because<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.840> his<00:02:10.960> crazy

to pick them up afterwards after they
land<00:03:51.739> that's<00:03:52.739> not<00:03:53.130> as<00:03:53.310> easy<00:03:53.430> though<00:03:53.730> because

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
land that's not as easy though because

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.030 
land that's not as easy though because
they're<00:03:54.870> about<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.200> explode<00:03:55.560> when<00:03:55.830> they're<00:03:55.950> on

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
they're about to explode when they're on

the ground

the ground
whereas<00:03:57.660> when<00:03:58.200> there<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:59.190> still<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.549> air

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
whereas when there is still in the air

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.789 
whereas when there is still in the air
you<00:03:59.790> had<00:03:59.879> a<00:03:59.910> lot<00:04:00.030> more<00:04:00.060> time<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.590> something

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you had a lot more time to do something

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.230 
you had a lot more time to do something
with<00:04:02.040> them

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.300 

you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.930> see<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.290> time<00:04:06.500> using<00:04:06.710> timing

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
you can see that the time using timing

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:25.680 
you can see that the time using timing
is<00:04:07.430> kind<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.640> tricky<00:04:07.910> here<00:04:08.090> he<00:04:08.690> keeps<00:04:09.140> moving

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.540 

it's<00:04:26.690> obviously<00:04:26.960> very<00:04:27.050> tricky<00:04:27.470> or<00:04:28.370> else<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
it's obviously very tricky or else I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's obviously very tricky or else I
would<00:04:28.669> have<00:04:28.759> done<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.000> my<00:04:29.090> new<00:04:29.380> still<00:04:30.380> nice

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
would have done it my new still nice

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.140 
would have done it my new still nice
tricky<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.069> friggin<00:04:31.400> crab<00:04:31.639> monster

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
tricky is that friggin crab monster

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.270 
tricky is that friggin crab monster
though<00:04:33.099> there<00:04:34.099> we<00:04:34.250> go<00:04:35.110> all<00:04:36.110> bombs<00:04:36.710> disappear

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
though there we go all bombs disappear

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.550 
though there we go all bombs disappear
and<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:38.000> mysterious<00:04:38.509> door<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.289> second

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
and a mysterious door to the second

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.490 
and a mysterious door to the second
