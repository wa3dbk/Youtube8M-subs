00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
space there they are competing for

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.730 
space there they are competing for
survival<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.540> whatever<00:02:55.140> they<00:02:55.350> need

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
survival of whatever they need

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.550 
survival of whatever they need
number<00:02:56.250> two<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.790> predation<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.200> happens

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
number two is predation and this happens

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.160 
number two is predation and this happens
when<00:02:59.160> one<00:02:59.460> organism<00:02:59.910> captures<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.750> feeds<00:03:00.990> on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
when one organism captures and feeds on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.080 
when one organism captures and feeds on
another<00:03:01.560> organism<00:03:02.090> predator-prey

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
another organism predator-prey

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.330 
another organism predator-prey
relationship<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.020> number<00:03:04.830> three<00:03:05.130> is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
relationship and number three is

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.120 
relationship and number three is
considered<00:03:05.580> symbiosis<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.100> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
considered symbiosis and this is a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.580 
considered symbiosis and this is a
relationship<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:09.060> which<00:03:09.090> two<00:03:09.600> organisms<00:03:10.170> live

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
relationship in which two organisms live

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.010 
relationship in which two organisms live
together<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.940> closed<00:03:12.210> nutritional

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
together in a closed nutritional

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.810 
together in a closed nutritional
relationship<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.310> they're<00:03:14.460> both<00:03:14.610> getting

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
relationship so they're both getting

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.760 
relationship so they're both getting
something<00:03:15.180> out<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.750> at<00:03:16.220> some<00:03:17.220> point<00:03:18.770> so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
something out of it at some point so

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.920 
something out of it at some point so
again<00:03:19.800> this<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.370> an<00:03:20.850> example<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.450> symbiotic

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
again this is an example of a symbiotic

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.160 
again this is an example of a symbiotic
relationship<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:24.030> will<00:03:24.150> notice<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.690> there

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
relationship you will notice that there

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.600 
relationship you will notice that there
is<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.320> bird<00:03:25.620> sitting<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.160> mouth<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.520> an

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
is a bird sitting in the mouth of an

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.900 
is a bird sitting in the mouth of an
alligator<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:28.500> reason<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.730> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
alligator the reason that this is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.120 
alligator the reason that this is
considered<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.540> symbiotic<00:03:30.990> relationship<00:03:31.290> is

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
considered a symbiotic relationship is

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.210 
considered a symbiotic relationship is
that<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.600> bird<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.080> getting<00:03:34.230> food<00:03:34.680> by

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
that that bird is getting food by

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.540 
that that bird is getting food by
picking<00:03:35.610> out<00:03:35.730> some<00:03:36.030> some<00:03:36.870> food<00:03:37.680> from<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
picking out some some food from the the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.640 
picking out some some food from the the
teeth<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.030> alligator<00:03:39.900> what<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
teeth of the alligator what the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.760 
teeth of the alligator what the
alligator<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.190> getting<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.030> getting

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
alligator is getting is it is getting

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.380 
alligator is getting is it is getting
free<00:03:43.770> dental<00:03:44.160> visit<00:03:44.490> it's<00:03:44.640> getting<00:03:45.030> its<00:03:45.180> teeth

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
free dental visit it's getting its teeth

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.600 
free dental visit it's getting its teeth
cleaned<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.950> going<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.340> allow<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
cleaned and that is going to allow that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.970 
cleaned and that is going to allow that
alligator<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.420> survive<00:03:48.810> longer<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
alligator to survive longer in the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
alligator to survive longer in the
future<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.460> well<00:03:53.390> there<00:03:54.390> are<00:03:54.420> three<00:03:55.170> different

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
future as well there are three different

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.620 
future as well there are three different
types<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.860> symbiosis<00:03:56.240> one<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.390> called

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
types of symbiosis one is called

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.220 
types of symbiosis one is called
commensalism<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.790> type<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.120> symbiosis<00:04:00.630> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
commensalism this type of symbiosis is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.920 
commensalism this type of symbiosis is
when<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:02.520> organism<00:04:02.880> benefits<00:04:03.540> from<00:04:03.780> this

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
when one organism benefits from this

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.810 
when one organism benefits from this
relationship<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:04.770> other<00:04:04.980> doesn't

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
relationship and the other doesn't

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.990 
relationship and the other doesn't
benefit<00:04:06.420> or<00:04:06.840> harmed<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.550> results

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
benefit or harmed and this is results

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.290 
benefit or harmed and this is results
represented<00:04:09.720> as<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> positive<00:04:10.290> or<00:04:10.860> zero<00:04:11.300> there

represented as a positive or zero there

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.730 
represented as a positive or zero there
are<00:04:12.420> some<00:04:12.570> various<00:04:12.900> examples<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.560> that

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
are some various examples of that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.970 
are some various examples of that

barnacles on a whale remoras on sharks
the<00:04:17.760> second<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.380> mutualism<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.500> this<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.190> when

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the second is mutualism and this is when

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.060 
the second is mutualism and this is when
both<00:04:20.549> organisms<00:04:20.940> benefit<00:04:21.660> as<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:22.140> said<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.950> the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
both organisms benefit as we said in the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.090 
both organisms benefit as we said in the
previous<00:04:23.220> picture<00:04:24.440> some<00:04:25.440> other<00:04:25.560> examples

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
in this instance the algae is providing

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.750 
in this instance the algae is providing
food<00:04:33.570> for<00:04:33.900> both<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.860> them<00:04:35.040> because<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.610> can

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
food for both of them because it can

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.210 
food for both of them because it can
carry<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:36.150> photosynthesis<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.770> fungus

humans this is a picture of athlete's
foot<00:05:05.039> in<00:05:05.189> humans<00:05:06.259> what<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:07.379> does<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.770> the

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
foot in humans what it does is the

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.070 
foot in humans what it does is the
fungus<00:05:08.279> gets<00:05:08.520> its<00:05:08.729> nutrition<00:05:09.360> from<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.719> skin

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
fungus gets its nutrition from the skin

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.129 
fungus gets its nutrition from the skin
but<00:05:10.770> in<00:05:10.979> response<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.939> it<00:05:12.180> causes<00:05:12.629> very

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
but in response that it causes very

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.869 
but in response that it causes very
itchy<00:05:13.909> skin<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.300> swelling<00:05:16.639> tapeworms<00:05:17.639> and

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
itchy skin and swelling tapeworms and

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.820 
itchy skin and swelling tapeworms and
animals<00:05:18.330> is<00:05:18.509> also<00:05:18.629> an<00:05:18.900> example<00:05:19.110> of<00:05:19.349> parasite

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
animals is also an example of parasite

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.260 
animals is also an example of parasite
ISM<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:20.599> this<00:05:21.599> happens<00:05:21.960> when<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.139> tapeworm

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
ISM and this happens when a tapeworm

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.330 
ISM and this happens when a tapeworm
inhabits<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.449> digestive<00:05:25.080> tract<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:25.710> it

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
inhabits the digestive tract and it

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.420 
inhabits the digestive tract and it
absorbs<00:05:26.879> the<00:05:27.000> nutrients<00:05:28.099> instead<00:05:29.099> of<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
absorbs the nutrients instead of the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.510 
absorbs the nutrients instead of the
host<00:05:29.699> so<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.240> host<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:31.009> really<00:05:32.009> not<00:05:32.159> getting

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
host so the host is really not getting

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.329 
host so the host is really not getting
any<00:05:32.669> of<00:05:32.969> the<00:05:33.389> needed<00:05:34.080> nourishment<00:05:34.500> it's<00:05:35.069> going

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
any of the needed nourishment it's going

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.700 
any of the needed nourishment it's going
to<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.580> tapeworm<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.779> again<00:05:37.319> we're<00:05:37.469> probably

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
to the tapeworm and again we're probably

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.950 
to the tapeworm and again we're probably
unfamiliar<00:05:38.310> with<00:05:38.400> mosquitoes<00:05:39.089> that<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.659> also

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
unfamiliar with mosquitoes that is also

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.909 
unfamiliar with mosquitoes that is also
an<00:05:40.050> example<00:05:40.259> of<00:05:40.650> parasite<00:05:41.550> ism
