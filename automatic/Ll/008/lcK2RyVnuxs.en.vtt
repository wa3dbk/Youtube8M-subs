00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.980
Hi everyone!

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.630
In this episode:

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.550
The main tournament of the season. First details.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.810
A-Gaming is searching for a new captain.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.550
National Cups. The prize pool got increased several times.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.450
The IS-3. A new master-class from Lebwa.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.740
The third Golden League season has finished recently, 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.080
but shortly we’ll see the Grand Finals of Wargaming League.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.510
The main tournament of the year will take place from April 4th to 6th in Warsaw.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.860
14 teams will come to the competition. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
Two of the best from each region plus two teams from the EU server 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.080
that got special invitations from the organizers.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.330
The preparations for the Grand Finals are proceeding at full steam.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.030
We did not stand aside:

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.590
We traveled around the globe, 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.370
met the players at their homes 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.480
and made lots of videos.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.530
Soon you’ll see a series of videos 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.320
that will introduce the tournament finalists to you.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.990
Stay posted!

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.700
While some teams are getting ready for Warsaw 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.510
the others are preparing for the next season.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.620
For example, the NOD are looking for two players.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.250
And the A-Gaming have worse troubles. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.120
The guys are left without a captain and are now looking for a substitute.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.770
See the details on the teams’ Vkontakte pages.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.580
Pleasant changes in the National Cups.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.790
First, the prize pool of the tournaments is now more than three times bigger.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.800
Second the number of participating teams is unlimited now.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.470
If you haven’t played yet now’s the time to try!

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.790
The details are on the website. The link’s in the description.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.190
On March 15th “OGIC” tournament finals will take place in St. Petersburg.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.110
The players from Synergy, Unity, Nod were noticed among the finalists 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.040
along with the infamous LOL team, 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.370
that are cleverly disguised with the name… “Easy Money”

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.560
The organizers promise to have a game zone and prizes for spectators.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.870
So come! It’ll be interesting.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.650
Another tournament of the “Tank Time” tournament will take place in Yaroslavl on March 23rd. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.130
The registration is open till the 13th.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.120
The tournament will also have the personal best nomination 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.720
that anyone can take part in.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.560
Come and win!

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.580
You will now see a master-class from Lebwa. 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.460
That’s all I have for today. Bye everybody!

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.960
Hi everyone, I am Lebwa!

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.120
In this episode I will tell you about the IS-3 heavy Soviet tank 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.480
that is so common for the 7x42 format.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.000
The IS-3 is one of the popular tournament tanks. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.080
It has 390 points of damage per shot and good armor penetration with APCR shells.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.220
By the way, the ordinary AP also has enough penetration to get through tier 8 tanks. 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.800
Because of the bad elevation angles, the gun can only be depressed for 5 degrees.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.470
This tank is mostly used for Himmelsdorf, Ensk, Ruinberg

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.110
where the terrain is pretty flat.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.230
No I will show you where to shoot the IS-3 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.450
to crit a module, or injure a crew member.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.940
If the IS-3 is facing you – shoot here, 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.900
this shot has a high chance to injure the driver.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.900
If you see the side of the tank 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.560
then shoot a little higher than the first roller from any side. 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.960
If you shoot the right side of the turret you can injure the loader,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.570
that’s the place he sits. 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.100
Just shoot a bit higher than the star, to be sure.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.100
The gunner and the commander are located in the left part of the turret.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.330
To injure the gunner shoot this railing,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.140
to get the commander shoot a bit higher than the star.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.780
Now let’s talk about the IS-3s most problematic thing – its ammunition rack.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.050
The ammo rack can be damaged with a hit to the hull and the turret.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.960
To get it when shooting at the hull – shoot between the third and forth rollers 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.400
from any side. 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.240
If the tank is facing you – shoot at the headlight

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.560
and the similar place from the other side, 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.390
this way you’ll surely damage the ammo rack. 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.940
You can also shoot the left part of the turret, preferable this place in particular. 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.440
Don’t forget to pick the “Safe Stowage” perk.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.910
It’ll keep your tank from blowing up when the ammo rack gets hit.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.440
If you can see the IS-3s side, shoot at the back part to get the fuel tanks. 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.730
Even one hit can cause the enemy tank to burn.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.360
Though don’t forget that usually 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.080
you crit the fuel tank with the first shot and only the second one causes fire.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.270
When in a firefight from portholes try to aim at the IS-3s turret roof, it’s pretty thin.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.160
Now I will make a couple of shots at the IS-3s side 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.190
and you’ll see the angles that are best for shooting this tank. 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.140
Thanks to the seams of the hull you can see the places where the spaced armor is.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.680
When you stand at a corner and want to have good aim at a line do the following. 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.150
First roll out at a small angle so that your armor doesn’t get penetrated. 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.480
Wait for a bit. If you see the sixth sense lamp – don’t go any further, 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.720
there is surely an enemy tank aiming at you.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.950
You will definitely get a shot 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.540
with no time to shoot in response.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.240
In case you are aiming at a corner of a building 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.580
and an enemy IS-3 tries to roll out this way –

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.590
shoot it at the turret roof and get back behind the corner.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.790
If you do this right then the enemy will have no time to damage you.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.970
If you are clenching don’t forget to block your opponent’s shot with your cannon. 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.370
This can be done in both sniper modes and arcade mode. 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.930
You can damage an opponent through the hatches on the turret, they can be easily penetrated.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.900
The IS-3s cannon gets damaged when the shell hits the half of the gun

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.290
that’s closer to the mantlet.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.700
Don’t forget to comment and say if you liked the master-class,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.270
