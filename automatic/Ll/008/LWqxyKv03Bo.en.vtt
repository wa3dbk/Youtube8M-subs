like magic and here we go it's gonna put

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.960 
like magic and here we go it's gonna put
the<00:01:33.570> phone<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:37.079> you'll<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the phone on there and you'll see that

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.539 
the phone on there and you'll see that
the<00:01:38.970> charger<00:01:39.270> itself<00:01:39.619> actually<00:01:40.619> glows<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the charger itself actually glows and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.960 
the charger itself actually glows and
it's<00:01:41.850> nice<00:01:41.970> blue<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.250> quite<00:01:44.399> nice<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's nice blue so that's quite nice and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
it's nice blue so that's quite nice and
it'll<00:01:45.210> oh<00:01:45.409> my<00:01:46.409> environment<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.130> see

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it'll oh my environment you can see

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
it'll oh my environment you can see
there<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> signs<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.659> looks<00:01:48.780> grand

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
there that signs up and it looks grand

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
there that signs up and it looks grand
my<00:01:49.079> desk<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> long<00:01:49.649> side<00:01:49.920> muscle

my desk with a long side muscle

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
my desk with a long side muscle
illuminated<00:01:50.790> keyboard<00:01:51.119> etcetera<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.140> bright

illuminated keyboard etcetera in bright

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
illuminated keyboard etcetera in bright
light<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.579> how

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
light you can see it you just make how

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.209 
light you can see it you just make how
the<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.509> halo<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> blue<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the the halo of the blue but this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.469 
the the halo of the blue but this is
really<00:01:56.520> bright<00:01:56.670> studio<00:01:57.030> light<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
really bright studio light and so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.719 
really bright studio light and so
usually<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.110> totally<00:01:58.500> visible<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.369> important

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
usually is totally visible and important

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.399 
usually is totally visible and important
things<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.450> our<00:02:00.630> Chi<00:02:00.810> charges<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
things know about our Chi charges is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670 
things know about our Chi charges is
placement<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> believe<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.600> s6<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
placement now I believe in s6 the the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.770 
placement now I believe in s6 the the
induction<00:02:05.549> pads<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> middle<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
induction pads right in the middle but

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.070 
induction pads right in the middle but
on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.710> g3<00:02:08.190> luckily<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.330> actually<00:02:09.599> find

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
on the g3 luckily I can actually find

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080 
on the g3 luckily I can actually find
out<00:02:10.259> there

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
out there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.660 
out there
magic<00:02:11.630> you'll<00:02:12.530> see<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.340> back<00:02:13.459> of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
magic you'll see that on the back of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.050 
magic you'll see that on the back of
this<00:02:13.819> g3<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:15.470> case<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.910> path

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
this g3 in case that there is the path

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.780 
this g3 in case that there is the path
because<00:02:17.750> almost<00:02:17.989> make<00:02:18.200> other<00:02:18.349> cools<00:02:18.650> there<00:02:18.920> so

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
because almost make other cools there so

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.010 
because almost make other cools there so
you<00:02:19.880> can<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.239> center<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.660> pad<00:02:20.840> is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
you can see the center of the pad is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.620 
you can see the center of the pad is
there<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.590> if<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.709> look<00:02:21.860> around<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.099> back

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
there and so if I look around the back

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.970 
there and so if I look around the back
it's<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.660> equivalent<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.170> there<00:02:24.410> which<00:02:24.620> isn't

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
it's the equivalent of there which isn't

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.589 
it's the equivalent of there which isn't
directly<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> middle<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.000> device<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
directly in the middle of the device so

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.570 
directly in the middle of the device so
usually<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.349> measure<00:02:27.620> power<00:02:27.890> consumption<00:02:28.489> I'd

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
usually to measure power consumption I'd

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.430 
usually to measure power consumption I'd
usually<00:02:28.760> use<00:02:29.000> one<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.180> these<00:02:29.300> meters<00:02:29.540> there

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
usually use one of these meters there

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.449 
usually use one of these meters there
was<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> fit<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.860> end<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.099> USB<00:02:31.310> cable

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
was a fit on the end of the USB cable

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.870 
was a fit on the end of the USB cable
and<00:02:31.940> give<00:02:32.120> me<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.269> really<00:02:32.510> good<00:02:32.660> idea<00:02:33.580> for<00:02:34.580> how

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
and give me a really good idea for how

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.750 
and give me a really good idea for how
many<00:02:35.030> amps<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.450> milliamps<00:02:36.340> again<00:02:37.340> provided<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
many amps or milliamps again provided to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.130 
many amps or milliamps again provided to
the<00:02:37.819> phone<00:02:38.000> however<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.720> instance<00:02:38.780> it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
the phone however in this instance it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.530 
the phone however in this instance it
doesn't<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:39.440> work<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
doesn't really work because of the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330 
doesn't really work because of the
induction<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:42.319> lost<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.130> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
induction and they lost there and so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.860 
induction and they lost there and so
using<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:43.790> app<00:02:43.940> called<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.299> pair<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
using a little app called a pair it's a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.390 
using a little app called a pair it's a
little<00:02:45.110> bit<00:02:45.200> flaky<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.739> what<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:45.980> showing<00:02:46.280> me

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
little bit flaky but what is showing me

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.289 
little bit flaky but what is showing me
it's<00:02:46.880> actually<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:48.410> performs<00:02:48.860> usually<00:02:49.340> based

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
it's actually it performs usually based

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.039 
it's actually it performs usually based
on<00:02:50.450> placement<00:02:50.690> around<00:02:51.530> half<00:02:52.510> half<00:02:53.510> an<00:02:53.630> amp<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
on placement around half half an amp and

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.380 
on placement around half half an amp and
so<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:55.250> pretty<00:02:55.580> average<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.209> Qi

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
so that's pretty average for a Qi

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.910 
so that's pretty average for a Qi
charger<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.349> honest<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.769> it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
charger and to be honest with you it's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.229 
charger and to be honest with you it's
absolutely<00:02:58.220> fine<00:02:58.370> when<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:58.849> your<00:02:59.030> desk

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
absolutely fine when it's on your desk

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.570 
absolutely fine when it's on your desk
because<00:02:59.590> you<00:03:00.590> usually<00:03:00.830> not<00:03:01.130> in<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> hurry<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
because you usually not in a hurry and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.770 
because you usually not in a hurry and
it's<00:03:01.940> one<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> those<00:03:02.209> things<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:02.540> better

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
it's one of those things that's better

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.809 
it's one of those things that's better
than<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.049> just<00:03:03.080> sitting<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:03.560> doing<00:03:03.650> nothing

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
than it just sitting there doing nothing

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.009 
than it just sitting there doing nothing
however<00:03:04.819> if<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.239> do<00:03:05.360> need<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> quick<00:03:05.750> charge

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
however if you do need a quick charge

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.020 
however if you do need a quick charge
and<00:03:06.620> you're<00:03:06.739> gonna<00:03:06.860> want<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.099> use<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.849> know

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
and you're gonna want to use it you know

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.610 
and you're gonna want to use it you know
a<00:03:08.299> really<00:03:08.750> good<00:03:08.930> quality<00:03:09.019> cable<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:09.560> I

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
a really good quality cable when I
