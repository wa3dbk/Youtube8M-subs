00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
recording this at the same time as I

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.150 
recording this at the same time as I
recorded<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.670> last<00:01:51.879> three<00:01:52.270> pose<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:53.160> really

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
recorded the last three pose I really

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.339 
recorded the last three pose I really
don't<00:01:54.369> know<00:01:54.550> yet<00:01:54.849> what<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> input<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:55.810> as<00:01:56.140> far

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
don't know yet what the input is as far

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.229 
don't know yet what the input is as far
as<00:01:57.420> making<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.509> second<00:01:58.840> cave<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.289> ordeals<00:01:59.440> run

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
as making a second cave of ordeals run

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.180 
as making a second cave of ordeals run
because<00:02:01.239> as<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.019> said<00:02:02.080> before<00:02:02.289> if<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.069> it<00:02:03.129> a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
because as I said before if you do it a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.249 
because as I said before if you do it a
second<00:02:03.489> time<00:02:03.519> the<00:02:03.910> monsters<00:02:04.330> are<00:02:04.450> harder<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
second time the monsters are harder and

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.910 
second time the monsters are harder and
so<00:02:06.160> because<00:02:06.399> of<00:02:06.429> that<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:08.530> considering

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
so because of that I was considering

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.220 
so because of that I was considering
doing<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.489> again<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.780> see<00:02:10.989> what<00:02:11.110> it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
doing it again just to see what it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.309 
doing it again just to see what it's
like<00:02:11.260> because<00:02:11.769> it's<00:02:12.069> supposedly<00:02:13.319> supposedly

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
like because it's supposedly supposedly

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.110 
like because it's supposedly supposedly
in<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> second<00:02:15.430> version<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.780> get<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:18.120> fight

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
in the second version you get to fight

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.960 
in the second version you get to fight
for<00:02:19.360> dark<00:02:19.629> nuts<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:19.989> once<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.440> final<00:02:20.709> floor

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
for dark nuts at once on the final floor

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.130 
for dark nuts at once on the final floor
so<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.209> thought<00:02:22.420> that'll<00:02:22.599> be<00:02:22.660> interesting<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
so I thought that'll be interesting to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.020 
so I thought that'll be interesting to
show<00:02:23.290> anyway<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.250> we're<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.730> tile
