00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.920
 where there are individuals and 6 music if I 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.410
 come this new video as we can 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.260
 see we are here again in the lemon 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.269
 master online and it's a video that many 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 have been asking for quite a while 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.550
 time and the truth is not like I did not play 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 the game I did not have anymore and mahinmi is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.420
 option also our I got to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 investigate until they helped me and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.210
 we found what we wanted to many is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.769
 a new bot that works for digimon 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 in 2014 and we are at the end of July 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.200
 it works completely and it does not detect it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.750
 for nothing the hack if the ok this I already have 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 understood that the other bowl that had 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 published what is detected is the hack if he already 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.730
 It gives as a world that is definitely 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.910
 so now what we have to do 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.410
 is we're going to go to the link they're going to be in 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.329
 the description are going to be two versions 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.940
 the 32-bit bot and the 64-bit bot 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.570
 putting and I use the 64 bit already 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 that my computer is 64 bits 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.590
 they are going to see two folders the two folders 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.610
 they will have the same file I think 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.010
 that are going to click right execute 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 as an administrator we give you that if 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 when the window appears, they are going to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 appear this little window that we 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.440
 says roberto puncernau said law and niche 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 acting the actions that we have here 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.240
 these fields and here tells us that a thousand thousand 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.910
 seconds is equal to one second and the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.790
 options that were recommended in was 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.990
 put five thousand 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.730
 In Myself 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.860
 0 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.700
 4000 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.700
 5000 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.819
 4 here are these options 5000 as 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.710
 it says there would be 5 seconds a 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.509
 second four seconds five seconds 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.270
 four seconds this is what is going to 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.380
 use the lakes and the times but in 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.049
 that in seeing the enemy in attacking in 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.630
 evolve is set to zero then in the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.940
 zero nothing else has evolved to the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.940
 first evolution that has or to the maximum 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 that you have available and this one stays 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.590
 obviously we will work depending 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.079
 of the peak size and I'm afraid that is what it is 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 ok saying grab the items that are going 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:26.769
 letting recover delay and activation 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 the truth is not that it was not coming 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.290
 specified how it works and in what 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.780
 recovery control slots but more or 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 except this booty was dedicated to farmar 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.430
 as right now the event of the boxes is 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.879
 lemon 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 This will kill you easy and pick up the boxes 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.750
 to see if items remain consoles 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.379
 that they give you that this is more than anything 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.969
 make it for pharma and not for relief 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.280
 then now we have active yes 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.909
 this the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.280
 leave the window open go to the meo 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:06.209
 assholes since we are here inside the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.639
 of meo right now to activate the board what 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.210
 only one that has to be done that frames 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.710
 witt 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.590
 the only thing that has to be done is 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.850
 press the f5 key let's get 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.780
 where there are several 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.780
 and several more 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.120
 here you are here we press the f5 key 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.610
 and let's see how to select solitos 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.910
 the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.650
 the tiny ones 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.010
 how can you see we 're not going to see the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.410
 mouse and start attacking evolution 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 to which he has we are not going to evolve the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.470
 first but start attacking several 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.020
 does not necessarily kill one attacks several 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.140
 we have that can go killing 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.620
 and luckily they have us a little box or 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.260
 something to pick up so they see if 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.150
 goes 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.150
 I'm going to pick up the camera 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.290
 I tell you that this hits several and already 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.420
 he is going to kill little by little but 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.319
 also that can be changed with the o2 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.319
 with the times that are in the program 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.100
 today we are going to see if they throw us a box 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.100
 I would not wait 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.280
 well we are turning 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.890
 continued 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.730
 so that it fits in a box so that 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.730
 see that it is collected 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.020
 the camera does not decide if these boxes 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.910
 if they are a bit difficult to get out 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.910
 so do not despair 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.940
 here 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.940
 pulls out 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.720
 as you can see this was alone 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.100
 pick up the box then and now what 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.169
 only one that has to be done to 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.020
 deactivate the vote already if from 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.569
 here is to press the special key well 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.830
 here is we are in the whole game 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.650
 tight before clares and see that 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.560
 disappearing in the program and no longer 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.750
 is running absolutely nothing that 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.780
 is in any way 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.270
 try it on your computers and 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.830
 You will see that if the 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.680
 program is this one that is finished 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.720
 show is for 64 bits is the 32 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.759
 but he reiterated that he has some 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.340
 problems that if you detect them or sometimes 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.130
 burn they detect it is worth nothing I do not know 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.560
 provide agreement subscribe comment 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.330

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.150
 also the link of the facebook page 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.909
 where you can also get this 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.370
 information of the new videos worth 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.520
 Well, we'll see you until next time
