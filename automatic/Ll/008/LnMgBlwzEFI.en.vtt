we're<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.599> gonna<00:02:58.690> move<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> up<00:02:59.260> just<00:03:00.150> enough

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
we're just gonna move it up just enough

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.400 
we're just gonna move it up just enough
to<00:03:01.450> cover<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.840> black

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.930 

yeah<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.630> keep<00:03:14.110> hitting<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.380> wrong<00:03:14.500> one<00:03:14.920> no<00:03:17.940> all

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
yeah I keep hitting the wrong one no all

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.850 
yeah I keep hitting the wrong one no all
right<00:03:19.030> get<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.390> off

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
right get it off

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.140 
right get it off
all<00:03:20.860> right<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.190> next<00:03:21.430> shape<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.730> use<00:03:21.910> now<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
all right the next shape I use now I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.060 
all right the next shape I use now I
toggled<00:03:22.600> with<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.870> eyes<00:03:23.170> quite<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> lot<00:03:23.890> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
toggled with the eyes quite a lot I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.440 
toggled with the eyes quite a lot I
didn't<00:03:24.310> really<00:03:24.490> know<00:03:24.580> what<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> use<00:03:25.090> for<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
didn't really know what to use for the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.480 
didn't really know what to use for the
eyes<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.960> tried<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> lot<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:26.860> different<00:03:26.980> shapes

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
eyes I tried a lot of different shapes

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.480 
eyes I tried a lot of different shapes
and<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.450> settled<00:03:29.080> with<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.350> one<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.740> don't<00:03:30.310> know

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
and I settled with this one I don't know

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.730 
and I settled with this one I don't know
why<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:31.300> just<00:03:31.360> struck<00:03:31.690> me<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:32.020> one<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
why it just struck me as one of the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.440 
why it just struck me as one of the
cooler<00:03:32.980> shapes<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.820> always<00:03:34.120> made<00:03:34.300> this

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
cooler shapes now I always made this

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.030 
cooler shapes now I always made this
right<00:03:34.750> eye<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.350> bigger<00:03:35.500> than<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.830> left

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
right eye a little bigger than the left

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
right eye a little bigger than the left
one<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.690> we're<00:03:37.810> gonna<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.230> like<00:03:38.350> right

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
one so we're gonna put it like right

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.620 
one so we're gonna put it like right
about<00:03:38.830> there

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
about there

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.880 
about there
all<00:03:40.630> right<00:03:40.810> we're<00:03:40.930> gonna<00:03:41.020> copy<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.560> I'm<00:03:41.800> gonna

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
all right we're gonna copy and I'm gonna

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.320 
all right we're gonna copy and I'm gonna
paste<00:03:42.420> click<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.660> we're<00:03:43.900> gonna<00:03:44.020> flip<00:03:44.260> it

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
paste click that we're gonna flip it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.240 
paste click that we're gonna flip it
turn<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.420> back<00:03:46.570> over<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.740> I'm<00:03:47.800> gonna<00:03:47.950> make<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
turn it back over so I'm gonna make it a

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.820 
turn it back over so I'm gonna make it a
little<00:03:48.340> smaller<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:49.260> actually<00:03:50.260> need<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.590> move

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
little smaller I actually need to move

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.680 
little smaller I actually need to move
his<00:03:51.010> face<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> little<00:03:51.610> over<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.180> left<00:03:52.420> too

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
his face a little over to the left too

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.100 
his face a little over to the left too
because<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.980> eyes<00:03:54.100> bigger<00:03:54.460> I<00:03:57.960> mean<00:03:58.960> that

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
because one eyes bigger I mean that

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.390 
because one eyes bigger I mean that
needs<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.350> be<00:03:59.410> tilts<00:03:59.740> a<00:03:59.770> little<00:03:59.980> more<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.220> match

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
needs to be tilts a little more to match

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.070 
needs to be tilts a little more to match
yeah<00:04:00.760> getting<00:04:01.060> this<00:04:01.150> leading<00:04:01.600> this<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.930> be<00:04:02.050> a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
yeah getting this leading this to be a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.660 
yeah getting this leading this to be a
somewhat<00:04:02.440> right<00:04:02.650> angle<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.220> hard<00:04:03.400> part

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
somewhat right angle it's the hard part

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.220 
somewhat right angle it's the hard part
so<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.360> don't<00:04:04.540> want<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.780> be<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> right<00:04:05.200> angle

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
so you don't want to be a right angle

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.500 
so you don't want to be a right angle
completely<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.790> want<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.270> little

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
completely but you want to be a little

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.780 
completely but you want to be a little
bit<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.780> right<00:04:07.960> angle<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:09.160> right<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.520> then

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
bit of a right angle all right and then

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.900 
bit of a right angle all right and then
we're<00:04:09.940> gonna<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.320> find<00:04:11.320> an<00:04:11.470> eye<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:12.130> forget<00:04:12.790> what

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
we're gonna go find an eye I forget what

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.330 
we're gonna go find an eye I forget what
I<00:04:12.940> used<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.270> read<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.920> wasn't<00:04:15.190> anything

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
I used to read I that wasn't anything

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.979 
I used to read I that wasn't anything
special<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:16.030> figure<00:04:16.359> which<00:04:16.480> one<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
special I figure which one of you is I

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.640 
special I figure which one of you is I
think<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.200> might<00:04:17.350> have<00:04:17.470> been<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:19.650> who

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
think it might have been this one who

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.860 
think it might have been this one who
knows<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.970> doesn't<00:04:22.210> really<00:04:22.300> matter<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.660> so

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
knows it doesn't really matter you so

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.120 
knows it doesn't really matter you so
the<00:04:23.140> only<00:04:23.200> thing<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.530> they<00:04:23.680> didn't<00:04:23.980> provide

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the only thing that they didn't provide

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.040 
the only thing that they didn't provide
which<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.760> thought<00:04:24.970> they<00:04:25.150> would<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.540> an<00:04:25.660> oval

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
which I thought they would is an oval

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.860 
which I thought they would is an oval
which<00:04:26.650> I'm<00:04:26.770> sure<00:04:26.920> you<00:04:27.040> can<00:04:27.220> make<00:04:27.520> an<00:04:27.730> oval<00:04:28.060> by

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
which I'm sure you can make an oval by

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.659 
which I'm sure you can make an oval by
using<00:04:29.200> some<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.560> these<00:04:29.740> shapes<00:04:29.980> I<00:04:30.310> think<00:04:30.580> it

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
using some of these shapes I think it

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.840 
using some of these shapes I think it
was<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:30.940> one<00:04:31.150> I'm<00:04:31.240> not<00:04:31.270> sure<00:04:32.580> might<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:33.669> well

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
was this one I'm not sure might as well

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.320 
was this one I'm not sure might as well
be

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.360 

yeah<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.360> think<00:04:41.509> it<00:04:41.629> was<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:41.870> one<00:04:42.909> no<00:04:43.909> I'm

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
yeah I think it was this one no I'm

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.080 
yeah I think it was this one no I'm
pretty<00:04:46.370> sure<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.639> was<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:46.879> one<00:04:48.940> all<00:04:49.940> right

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
pretty sure it was that one all right

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.390 
pretty sure it was that one all right
now<00:04:50.180> we're<00:04:50.300> gonna<00:04:50.389> hit<00:04:50.629> copy<00:04:50.930> paste<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.919> again

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
now we're gonna hit copy paste it again

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.350 
now we're gonna hit copy paste it again
flip<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:54.520> make<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:55.639> one<00:04:55.789> a<00:04:55.819> little<00:04:55.879> smaller

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
flip it make this one a little smaller

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.320 
flip it make this one a little smaller
to<00:04:56.509> match<00:04:56.659> the<00:04:56.870> eye<00:04:56.900> size<00:04:57.909> that's<00:04:58.909> just<00:04:59.150> where

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
to match the eye size that's just where

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.490 
to match the eye size that's just where
you<00:04:59.360> want<00:04:59.599> to<00:04:59.659> Center<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.110> where<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:00.319> trying

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
you want to Center and where you trying

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.930 
you want to Center and where you trying
it<00:05:00.620> what's<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.979> you<00:05:01.069> can<00:05:01.190> move<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.520> eyes<00:05:01.639> a<00:05:01.669> lot

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
it what's it you can move the eyes a lot

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.540 
it what's it you can move the eyes a lot
to<00:05:02.090> make<00:05:02.240> them<00:05:02.360> look<00:05:02.509> at<00:05:02.659> different<00:05:02.960> areas<00:05:03.550> but

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
to make them look at different areas but

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.420 
to make them look at different areas but
I<00:05:04.819> guess<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.449> kind<00:05:05.629> of<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.840> guess

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
I guess this is kind of a guess

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.559 
I guess this is kind of a guess
all<00:05:07.430> right<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.789> next<00:05:07.909> one<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.180> obvious<00:05:08.509> the

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
all right the next one is obvious the

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.890 
all right the next one is obvious the
obvious<00:05:08.599> brush<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.569> one's<00:05:11.720> gonna<00:05:11.810> be

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
obvious brush and that one's gonna be

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.550 
obvious brush and that one's gonna be
the<00:05:13.479> pretty<00:05:14.479> much<00:05:14.629> the<00:05:14.780> most<00:05:14.930> obvious<00:05:15.379> the

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
the pretty much the most obvious the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.540 
the pretty much the most obvious the
easy<00:05:15.680> part<00:05:16.069> to<00:05:16.159> make<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.460> this<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.690> brush

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
easy part to make it this it's the brush

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.249 
easy part to make it this it's the brush
as<00:05:19.550> soon<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.360> saw<00:05:20.539> they<00:05:20.690> had<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.080> was

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
as soon as I saw they had that I was

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.559 
as soon as I saw they had that I was
like<00:05:21.349> I've<00:05:21.500> gotta<00:05:21.770> make<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.039> Marvin<00:05:22.569> because

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
like I've gotta make the Marvin because

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.839 
like I've gotta make the Marvin because
the<00:05:23.690> brush<00:05:23.870> is<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.169> other<00:05:24.289> I<00:05:24.620> guess<00:05:25.580> one<00:05:25.819> of

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
the brush is the other I guess one of

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.499 
the brush is the other I guess one of
the<00:05:26.000> essential<00:05:26.479> pieces<00:05:26.629> to<00:05:26.990> make<00:05:27.110> this<00:05:27.319> guy

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
the essential pieces to make this guy

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:36.520 
the essential pieces to make this guy
I'm<00:05:29.509> gonna<00:05:29.659> kind<00:05:29.870> of<00:05:29.900> make<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.080> bright<00:05:35.530> gotta

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
I'm gonna kind of make it bright gotta

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:45.129 
I'm gonna kind of make it bright gotta
get<00:05:36.680> control<00:05:37.009> of<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.159> controls<00:05:42.909> there<00:05:44.139> all

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
get control of the controls there all

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.360 
get control of the controls there all
