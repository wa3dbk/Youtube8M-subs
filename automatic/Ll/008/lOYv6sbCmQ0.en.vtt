00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
that would be pretty cool I have to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.630

didn't<00:03:33.060> look<00:03:33.210> at<00:03:33.330> their<00:03:33.480> store<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.930> see<00:03:34.080> what

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
didn't look at their store to see what

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
didn't look at their store to see what
other<00:03:34.380> types<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.920> items<00:03:35.040> they<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.430> I'm<00:03:35.790> sure

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
other types of items they have I'm sure

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.240 
other types of items they have I'm sure
they<00:03:36.150> got<00:03:36.330> other<00:03:36.990> things<00:03:37.140> they<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:38.010> I

think<00:03:39.210> they've<00:03:39.330> been<00:03:39.360> cool<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:40.260> Spock<00:03:40.620> had<00:03:40.920> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
think they've been cool if Spock had a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.590 
think they've been cool if Spock had a
tricorder<00:03:42.560> spin<00:03:43.560> them<00:03:43.680> all<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.980> way<00:03:44.100> around

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
might be a better hairpiece for him than

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.530 
might be a better hairpiece for him than
that<00:03:50.700> but<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.420> slicked<00:03:51.720> back<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.540> pretty

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that but it is slicked back so pretty

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.070 
that but it is slicked back so pretty
good<00:03:55.250> like<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.520> torso<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.450> that's<00:04:00.690> some

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
good like the torso so that's some
