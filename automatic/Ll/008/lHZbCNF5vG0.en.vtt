00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello my name is vadim stanek from 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.069
 online store will today want 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.960
 show you more such a thing is 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.870
 detector and Tatar hidden wiring and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 other materials 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.630
 bosch gms 120 that this thing can 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 this thing is absolutely normal can 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 let's say here in such a wall or in that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 find hidden wall as open cable 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 find fittings find if we sheathe 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 drywall in the proton wall find 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 the profile that we beg let's 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.890
 Now a little more later we will go 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 let's take a look at the functional 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 what is the packaging itself 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.950
 we have instructions you can as usual 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 gives in all languages ​​Russian Ukrainian 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.420
 here to the fullest 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.550
 the box itself is a detector detector to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 we will return to him more usually in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.489
 this plan was the goal they immediately 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.309
 complete it with a crown battery, we have it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 already inserted here it is already so 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.770
 there is further and here inside we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 cord to this thing can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.900
 there was somewhere to keep a dressing and comfortable 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 case in which it can be stored 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.840
 everything seems to him nothing more 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.560
 need to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 Now we go over to a light crash 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 convenient in the center there is an opportunity 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 pencil of us can go on 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 pencil or pen insert make 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
 the hole that will show us in which 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.270
 the place we have is what it is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 dashes and here dash gives us 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.060
 opportunity 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.880
 Well, show me here in the center of this one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.329
 point he actually shows the direction 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.360
 here, too, by the way dash he works in 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.750
 live wire search mode 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.670
 metal search and search 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 drywall mode ie he is looking for a tree 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.430
 looking for metal reinforcement and so on 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.110
 turn on here he turned on all over again 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.540
 the sensors we passed we have here 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 there is also a backlight and mode 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.619
 turning on mute is silent 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 Now we will try and test in 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:19.379
 sound mode here let's start to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.349
 wiring mode example check look 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.120
 look began to swear 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.049
 Now go into it in this place, he 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.840
 swears around he just shows what 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.400
 put on theoretically there he is 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.879
 Straight swears so and clearly shows that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.849
 live wire coming down from above 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.489
 switch mode 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.359
 metal mode but now in theory 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:53.519
 will show a little more something here with us 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:56.790
 have here we have wiring anyway 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:10.310
 shows us flashing and lies 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:10.310
 drywall wall is not entirely monolithic 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:31.519
 we still have something in this place 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.319
 what a good thing it is one of the top well, 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.890
 let's say so in a simple ruler top 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.670
 divine development he punches on at 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.099
 searching 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.560
 metal it extends flashing the wall to 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.840
 120 millimeters that is it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.700
 approximately 12 12 centimeters there 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.950
 he is capable of such depth 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:56.780
 recognize metal under 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:01.190
 the theme of the concrete here as usual at bosh such 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.670
 dust spray pieces not protected 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.380
 prescribe here boils done in 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.790
 Malaysia more a lot 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.610
 measuring technique is done in 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.040
 Malaysia's a good one 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.440
 one of those good horses 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.519
 which are used a lot often 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.880
 often people sell such things to everyone 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.880
 thank 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.840
 important thing is the warranty on the blue technique 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.710
 more we have a default warranty of 12 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.310
 months +

 three year warranty 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.960
 We usually offer such things to the client. 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.880
 and do it yourself 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.700
 in order for you easier and more convenient as well
