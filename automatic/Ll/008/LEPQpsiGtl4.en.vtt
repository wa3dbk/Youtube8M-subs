one ear cup because it's really easy to
take<00:03:54.519> out<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.030> want<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.390> travel<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.900> can

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
take out if you want to travel you can

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.390 
take out if you want to travel you can
just<00:03:56.200> wrap<00:03:56.350> these<00:03:56.530> up<00:03:56.739> without<00:03:57.040> having<00:03:57.190> to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
just wrap these up without having to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.830 
just wrap these up without having to
worry<00:03:57.519> about<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.730> wire<00:03:57.850> being<00:03:58.359> attached<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
worry about a wire being attached to the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.599 
worry about a wire being attached to the
headset<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.350> also<00:03:59.620> since<00:03:59.829> it's<00:04:00.070> only<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.340> one

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
headset and also since it's only on one

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.610 
headset and also since it's only on one
it's<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.390> as<00:04:01.510> annoying<00:04:01.720> as<00:04:02.019> wires<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.500> have

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
it's not as annoying as wires that have

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.259 
it's not as annoying as wires that have
them<00:04:02.769> attached<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.040> both<00:04:03.459> now<00:04:03.850> since<00:04:04.120> these

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
them attached to both now since these

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.390 
them attached to both now since these
are<00:04:04.450> noise<00:04:04.870> cancelling<00:04:05.590> earphones<00:04:06.130> you're

cancellation<00:04:30.139> now<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.650> headset<00:04:30.979> does

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
cancellation now this headset does

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.920 
cancellation now this headset does
feature<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.699> noise<00:04:31.879> cancellation<00:04:32.240> like<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.659> said

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
feature a noise cancellation like I said

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.839 
feature a noise cancellation like I said
and<00:04:33.169> actually<00:04:33.979> able<00:04:34.159> planet<00:04:34.550> does<00:04:34.699> some<00:04:34.819> of

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
and actually able planet does some of

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.399 
and actually able planet does some of
the<00:04:34.940> best<00:04:35.150> noise<00:04:35.300> cancellation<00:04:36.080> I'd<00:04:36.259> be

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
the best noise cancellation I'd be

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.930 
the best noise cancellation I'd be
testing<00:04:36.710> these<00:04:36.800> headphones<00:04:37.009> for<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> while<00:04:37.699> now

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
testing these headphones for a while now

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.909 
testing these headphones for a while now
and<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.180> can<00:04:38.330> tell<00:04:38.509> you<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:39.349> when<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.530> do<00:04:39.740> have

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
and I can tell you that when you do have

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.740 
and I can tell you that when you do have
the<00:04:40.039> noise<00:04:40.190> cancellation<00:04:40.639> activated<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.539> will

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
the noise cancellation activated it will

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.749 
the noise cancellation activated it will
pretty<00:04:42.110> much<00:04:42.319> block<00:04:42.620> out<00:04:42.830> all<00:04:42.979> ambient<00:04:43.490> noise

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
pretty much block out all ambient noise

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.279 
pretty much block out all ambient noise
so<00:04:43.909> if<00:04:43.970> anyone's<00:04:44.389> like<00:04:44.509> whispering<00:04:44.960> around

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
it's like fans going on around you it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.969 
it's like fans going on around you it
actually<00:04:49.819> will<00:04:50.289> cancel<00:04:51.289> out<00:04:51.379> that<00:04:51.440> noise<00:04:51.740> and

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
actually will cancel out that noise and

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.140 
actually will cancel out that noise and
you'll<00:04:52.069> be<00:04:52.159> able<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.370> focus<00:04:52.550> more<00:04:52.729> on<00:04:52.940> your

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
you'll be able to focus more on your

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.760 
you'll be able to focus more on your
music<00:04:53.539> or<00:04:53.659> like<00:04:53.810> your<00:04:54.020> podcast<00:04:54.470> wherever

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770

music or like your podcast wherever
you're<00:04:54.949> listening<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.460> um<00:04:55.699> it<00:04:56.030> doesn't

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
you're listening to um it doesn't

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.700 
you're listening to um it doesn't
actually<00:04:56.659> you<00:04:56.780> know<00:04:56.870> like<00:04:57.020> block<00:04:57.259> out<00:04:57.470> like<00:04:57.590> if

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
actually you know like block out like if

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.770 
actually you know like block out like if
you<00:04:57.770> sitting<00:04:58.069> there<00:04:58.180> clapping<00:04:59.180> like<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.539> in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
you sitting there clapping like that in

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.689 
you sitting there clapping like that in
front<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.139> like<00:05:00.289> your<00:05:01.220> face<00:05:01.460> or<00:05:01.669> something

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
front of like your face or something

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.100 
front of like your face or something
like<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.300> not<00:05:02.330> gonna<00:05:02.569> block<00:05:02.870> out<00:05:03.080> that

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
like that it's not gonna block out that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.080 
like that it's not gonna block out that
obviously<00:05:04.099> just<00:05:04.280> because<00:05:04.370> that's<00:05:04.639> too<00:05:04.849> loud

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
obviously just because that's too loud

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.360 
obviously just because that's too loud
but<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.050> will<00:05:06.169> block<00:05:06.409> out<00:05:06.590> all<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.949> ambient

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
but it will block out all that ambient

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.589 
but it will block out all that ambient
noise<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.819> just<00:05:07.970> don't<00:05:08.150> want<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.479> have

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
noise that you just don't want to have

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.390 
noise that you just don't want to have
going<00:05:09.139> in<00:05:09.259> your<00:05:09.349> ears<00:05:09.560> or<00:05:09.770> distracting<00:05:10.340> you

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
supposed to do it actually is supposed

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.879 
supposed to do it actually is supposed

increase perceived loudness without
increasing<00:06:42.400> volume<00:06:42.790> so<00:06:43.240> I<00:06:43.270> can't<00:06:43.660> actually

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
ton so it's supposed to perceive that

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.990

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
loud and that is somewhat due to the

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.340 
loud and that is somewhat due to the
noise<00:07:09.970> cancellation<00:07:10.300> in<00:07:10.540> my<00:07:10.630> opinion<00:07:11.110> but<00:07:11.290> I

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
noise cancellation in my opinion but I

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.510 
noise cancellation in my opinion but I
