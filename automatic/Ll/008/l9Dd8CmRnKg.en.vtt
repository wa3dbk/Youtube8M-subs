00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.260
 options y leads to what result a 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.360
 It opens the window a new corner when 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 whose assistance we will not indicate 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.710
 parameters opened by us 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 porter 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.780
 and actually make trading

 studying the interface of this window 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.730
 the first thing to pay attention to is 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.140
 symbol character is that tool by 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.610

 and lists will be only those characters 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.710
 which dogs you have are not a market review 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.400
 after choosing a tool worth

 the volume in this case is indicated by rafts 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 for example for force tools each 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.360
 lot is 100 thousand units of base 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 currency 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 if after seeing the volume of the button 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.840
 Abaya from the villages rose inactive 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.019
