button to open the door and I realize
the<00:02:57.580> ha<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:58.150> where<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> linkage<00:02:58.720> wait<00:02:58.959> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the ha it's where the linkage wait and

carbon<00:03:08.110> fiber<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:09.580> clearly<00:03:09.880> went<00:03:10.120> over

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
carbon fiber they clearly went over

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.850

every<00:03:10.630> single<00:03:10.810> piece<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.350> says<00:03:11.470> house<00:03:11.680> when

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
every single piece and says house when

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
that drives the price to the roof so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.449 
that drives the price to the roof so
that's<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.450> good<00:03:17.110> point<00:03:17.350> there<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.830> good<00:03:18.070> time<00:03:18.250> to
