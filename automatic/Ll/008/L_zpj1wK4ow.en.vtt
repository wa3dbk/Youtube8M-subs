00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and we got some

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.950 
and we got some
down<00:01:33.250> there<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:37.119> would<00:01:37.329> be<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.479> pretty<00:01:37.689> good

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
down there this would be a pretty good

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.080 
down there this would be a pretty good
test<00:01:38.259> when<00:01:38.469> I<00:01:38.619> opened<00:01:38.979> up<00:01:39.100> how<00:01:39.310> good<00:01:39.579> that<00:01:39.759> tub

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
test when I opened up how good that tub

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.700 
test when I opened up how good that tub
did<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.430> see<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.670> had<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> ground<00:01:43.710> ground

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
did you can see I had the ground ground

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.520 
did you can see I had the ground ground
talked<00:01:45.070> there<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.500> pretty<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.990> much<00:01:50.229> set

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
talked there it's pretty pretty much set

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.090 
talked there it's pretty pretty much set
water<00:01:51.659> soaking<00:01:52.659> up<00:01:52.869> these<00:01:53.049> rain<00:01:53.350> flies<00:01:56.100> yes

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
water soaking up these rain flies yes

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.419 
water soaking up these rain flies yes
see<00:01:57.429> what<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.819> heck<00:01:58.030> happened<00:01:58.299> here

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.730 

so<00:02:03.429> I<00:02:03.460> guess<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.909> be<00:02:04.060> saving<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.659> tent<00:02:05.470> made

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so I guess to be saving this tent made

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:17.370 
so I guess to be saving this tent made
it<00:02:05.890> any<00:02:06.039> tech<00:02:06.369> could<00:02:06.549> make<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:17.019> looks

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
it any tech could make it and it looks

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:34.850 
it any tech could make it and it looks
to<00:02:17.680> me<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.840> made<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.230> oh<00:02:31.560> there's<00:02:32.560> some<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to me as it made it oh there's some that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.800 
to me as it made it oh there's some that
we<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:35.890> rained<00:02:37.200> within<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.319> tent<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:40.569> I'm

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
we have rained within the tent just I'm

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.610 
we have rained within the tent just I'm
gonna<00:02:41.049> see<00:02:41.290> about<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:49.290> there's<00:02:50.290> your<00:02:50.440> next

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
gonna see about this there's your next

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.650 
gonna see about this there's your next
problem<00:02:50.920> being<00:02:51.160> inside<00:02:51.489> tents<00:02:51.850> trying<00:02:52.600> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
problem being inside tents trying to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.009 
problem being inside tents trying to
climb<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.549> far<00:02:54.940> side<00:02:55.269> over<00:02:55.299> here

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.479 

you<00:02:59.019> can<00:02:59.170> see<00:02:59.379> if<00:02:59.470> there's<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.830> water

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
you can see if there's little water

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.899 
you can see if there's little water
inside<00:03:00.819> -<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.239> comes

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.289 

yeah<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:08.560> have<00:03:08.739> water<00:03:08.950> within<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.580> which<00:03:09.970> means

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
yeah we have water within it which means

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.729 
yeah we have water within it which means
I<00:03:10.690> didn't<00:03:11.260> seal<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.500> seam<00:03:11.830> very<00:03:12.159> well<00:03:13.739> and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
I didn't seal the seam very well and

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.300 
I didn't seal the seam very well and
I'll<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.280> figure<00:03:15.549> out<00:03:15.640> where<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:18.069> water

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I'll have to figure out where that water

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.400 
I'll have to figure out where that water
came<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.640> -<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.360> that's<00:03:22.810> what<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.079> get<00:03:23.260> with

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
came in - so that's what you get with

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:33.800 
came in - so that's what you get with
you<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.890> oh<00:03:28.110> well

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.170 

water<00:03:34.810> has<00:03:35.079> found<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.680> way<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:38.700> its<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:39.970> this

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
water has found this way in its in this

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.770 
water has found this way in its in this
area<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:43.150> I'm<00:03:43.390> assuming<00:03:45.329> it's<00:03:46.329> probably

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
area so I'm assuming it's probably

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.550 
area so I'm assuming it's probably
within<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.260> scene<00:03:49.349> put<00:03:50.349> some<00:03:50.530> ceiling<00:03:50.920> on<00:03:51.069> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
within this scene put some ceiling on it

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.450 
within this scene put some ceiling on it
maybe<00:03:53.560> not<00:03:53.799> enough

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.440 

yeah<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.490> guess<00:04:00.730> could<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.030> better<00:04:01.150> with<00:04:01.300> that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
yeah I guess could have better with that

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.380 
yeah I guess could have better with that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.280 

but<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:23.230> would<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.410> honest<00:04:23.710> about<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:25.290> we've

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
but that would be honest about it we've

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.680 
but that would be honest about it we've
definitely<00:04:26.530> got<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.040> seam<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.310> up<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.450> have<00:04:31.480> to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
definitely got to seam it up you have to

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.530 
definitely got to seam it up you have to
put<00:04:32.080> those<00:04:34.020> silicon<00:04:35.700> rub<00:04:36.700> ons<00:04:36.910> along<00:04:37.270> all

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
put those silicon rub ons along all

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.870 
put those silicon rub ons along all
these<00:04:37.810> things<00:04:41.010> obviously<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.280> wasn't<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:42.670> lot

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
these things obviously that wasn't a lot

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.090 
these things obviously that wasn't a lot
of<00:04:43.030> rain<00:04:43.530> for<00:04:44.530> two<00:04:45.220> or<00:04:45.340> three<00:04:45.550> days<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.880> rain

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
of rain for two or three days of rain

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.790 
of rain for two or three days of rain
but<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.670> still<00:04:49.230> messed<00:04:50.230> it<00:04:50.440> up

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
but it still messed it up

00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:03.159 
but it still messed it up
I<00:04:52.200> guess<00:04:53.340> Chocula

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.229
