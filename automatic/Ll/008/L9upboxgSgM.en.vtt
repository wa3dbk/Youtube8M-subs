another<00:01:49.490> hundred<00:01:49.640> at<00:01:49.940> least<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.270> bottom

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
another hundred at least the bottom

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.250 
another hundred at least the bottom
hands<00:01:50.660> on<00:01:50.810> these<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.950> pretty<00:01:52.220> tough<00:01:53.170> at<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
hands on these are pretty tough at the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.830 
hands on these are pretty tough at the
moment<00:01:54.560> doesn't<00:01:54.710> work<00:01:55.040> it's<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:56.390> latch<00:01:56.600> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
moment doesn't work it's the latch is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.820 
moment doesn't work it's the latch is
stuck<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:57.410> don't<00:01:57.530> know<00:01:57.620> how<00:01:57.680> you're<00:01:57.770> gonna

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
stuck so I don't know how you're gonna

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.890 
stuck so I don't know how you're gonna
get<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.160> hood<00:01:58.280> open<00:01:58.430> at<00:01:59.330> some<00:01:59.600> point<00:01:59.780> you'll

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
get the hood open at some point you'll

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.360 
get the hood open at some point you'll
want<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.110> do<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.710> probably<00:02:00.950> adjust

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
want to do that and you probably adjust

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.969 
want to do that and you probably adjust
the<00:02:01.460> tension<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.470> cord<00:02:03.710> under

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
the tension on the on the cord under

the tension on the on the cord under
here<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.360> mean<00:02:05.360> past<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.690> smog<00:02:05.900> test<00:02:06.170> about<00:02:06.380> a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
here I mean past the smog test about a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.830 
here I mean past the smog test about a
year<00:02:06.680> ago<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.490> you'll<00:02:07.760> need<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.030> smog<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.450> again

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
year ago so you'll need to smog it again

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.090 
year ago so you'll need to smog it again
one<00:02:09.080> thing<00:02:09.260> that's<00:02:09.380> strange<00:02:09.710> that<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.950> haven't

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
one thing that's strange that I haven't

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.290 
one thing that's strange that I haven't
been<00:02:10.250> able<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.429> figure<00:02:10.700> out<00:02:10.820> is<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
been able to figure out is that the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.330 
been able to figure out is that the
check<00:02:11.480> engine<00:02:11.510> light<00:02:11.959> comes<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.100> sit

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
check engine light comes on if you sit

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.680 
check engine light comes on if you sit
an<00:02:13.459> idle<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.970> while<00:02:14.120> when<00:02:14.360> you're<00:02:14.450> driving

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
an idle for a while when you're driving

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.300 
an idle for a while when you're driving
around<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.050> works<00:02:15.260> fine<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.160> if

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
around it works fine but it's just if

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.530 
around it works fine but it's just if
you<00:02:16.370> get<00:02:16.489> stuck<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.700> traffic<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.239> sit<00:02:17.420> for

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
you get stuck in traffic and you sit for

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you get stuck in traffic and you sit for
a<00:02:17.570> while<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> check<00:02:17.959> engine<00:02:18.110> light<00:02:18.350> will<00:02:18.470> come

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
a while the check engine light will come

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.990 
a while the check engine light will come
on<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.010> it'll<00:02:19.160> go<00:02:19.310> off<00:02:19.459> once<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> start

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
on and then it'll go off once you start

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.570 
on and then it'll go off once you start
driving<00:02:20.330> again<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.050> that's<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.040> challenge<00:02:22.220> for

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
driving again so that's a challenge for

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.860 
driving again so that's a challenge for
you<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.940> was<00:02:23.090> happening<00:02:23.480> when<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.720> passed

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you that was happening when it passed

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.840 
you that was happening when it passed
emissions<00:02:24.290> also<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:25.070> for<00:02:25.280> some<00:02:25.430> reason<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
emissions also but for some reason it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.360 
emissions also but for some reason it
still<00:02:26.030> passed<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.920> good<00:02:27.920> luck<00:02:28.040> with<00:02:28.100> that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
still passed so good luck with that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.310 
still passed so good luck with that
that's<00:02:28.610> your<00:02:28.850> problem<00:02:29.030> not<00:02:29.270> mine<00:02:29.510> that's<00:02:30.050> what

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
that's your problem not mine that's what

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.020 
that's your problem not mine that's what
you<00:02:30.380> get<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.160> thousand-dollar<00:02:31.489> car<00:02:31.850> but

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
you get in a thousand-dollar car but

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.160 
you get in a thousand-dollar car but
hopefully<00:02:32.300> if<00:02:32.360> you've<00:02:32.450> got<00:02:32.600> some<00:02:32.750> mechanical

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
hopefully if you've got some mechanical

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.380 
hopefully if you've got some mechanical
inclinations<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.890> can<00:02:34.070> probably<00:02:34.850> figure<00:02:35.269> out

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
inclinations you can probably figure out

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.900 
inclinations you can probably figure out
what<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:36.310> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.400> don't<00:02:37.550> have<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.700> place<00:02:37.880> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
what it is if you don't have a place to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.330 
what it is if you don't have a place to
live<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> could<00:02:38.450> be<00:02:38.540> your<00:02:38.690> home<00:02:39.160> take<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
live this could be your home take the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.560 
live this could be your home take the
seats<00:02:40.580> out<00:02:40.730> put<00:02:40.970> them<00:02:41.030> out<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.239> front<00:02:41.420> like

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
seats out put them out in front like

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.720 
seats out put them out in front like
couches<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.500> your<00:02:42.590> porch<00:02:42.830> put<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.160> putting<00:02:43.580> air

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730

there<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.830> something<00:02:55.130> weird<00:02:55.340> about<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.140> power

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
there is something weird about the power

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.470 
there is something weird about the power
lock<00:02:57.530> switch<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.700> use<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> power<00:02:59.239> lock

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
lock switch if you use the power lock

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.150 
lock switch if you use the power lock
switch<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.019> then<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.260> let<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> car<00:03:00.890> sit

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.500 
starter I never bothered to diagnose it
I<00:03:07.370> would<00:03:07.489> think<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.820> smart<00:03:08.120> guy<00:03:08.300> would

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
I would think the smart guy would

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.880 
I would think the smart guy would
probably<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:08.959> unhook<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.380> power<00:03:09.650> lock

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
probably just unhook the power lock

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.699 
probably just unhook the power lock
switch<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:11.320> then<00:03:12.320> it<00:03:12.440> wouldn't<00:03:12.650> have

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
switch and then then it wouldn't have

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.240 
switch and then then it wouldn't have
the<00:03:12.950> ability<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.780> run<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.900> battery<00:03:15.080> down<00:03:15.290> so

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
the ability to run the battery down so

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.620 
the ability to run the battery down so
you'll<00:03:16.490> want<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.730> deal<00:03:16.880> with<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.060> right<00:03:17.450> away

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
you'll want to deal with that right away

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.330 
you'll want to deal with that right away
or<00:03:17.960> just<00:03:18.260> don't<00:03:18.470> use<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.680> if<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.190> use

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
or just don't use it if you don't use

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.809 
or just don't use it if you don't use
the<00:03:19.490> power

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
the power

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.899 
the power
which<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.420> gone<00:03:20.629> for<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.560> know<00:03:21.590> years<00:03:22.249> it's

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
which it's gone for you know years it's

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:23.800 
which it's gone for you know years it's
just<00:03:23.090> when<00:03:23.209> somebody<00:03:23.450> touches<00:03:23.569> the

power/lock switch and uses it then the

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.239 
power/lock switch and uses it then the
battery<00:03:25.819> will<00:03:25.939> run<00:03:26.090> down<00:03:26.269> after<00:03:26.629> a<00:03:26.659> few<00:03:26.719> days
