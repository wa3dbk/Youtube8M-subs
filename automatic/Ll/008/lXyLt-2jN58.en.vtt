00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
code which is for 1 1 2 from here you're

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
code which is for 1 1 2 from here you're
gonna<00:00:46.500> program<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.360> zones<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:50.390> now

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
gonna program all right zones and now

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
gonna program all right zones and now
from<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.050> gonna<00:00:52.110> pick<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> first<00:00:52.770> own

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
from here we're gonna pick the first own

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.590 
from here we're gonna pick the first own
available<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> zone<00:00:53.910> 2<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.420> these

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
available which is zone 2 on all these
panels<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.590> we're<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.800> highlight<00:00:56.070> zone<00:00:56.430> 2

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
panels so we're gonna highlight zone 2

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
panels so we're gonna highlight zone 2
and<00:00:56.730> edit<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.010> serial<00:00:59.430> number

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and edit from here the serial number

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.510 
and edit from here the serial number
gets<00:01:00.180> entered<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> top<00:01:00.930> left<00:01:07.400> once<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
gets entered on the top left once you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
gets entered on the top left once you
have<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.760> serial<00:01:09.180> number<00:01:09.210> put<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.780> dunk<00:01:10.619> now

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
have your serial number put in dunk now

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
have your serial number put in dunk now
you<00:01:11.580> need<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> set<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> loop<00:01:12.720> number<00:01:12.900> two<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you need to set the loop number two the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
you need to set the loop number two the
correct<00:01:13.500> loop<00:01:13.740> number<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.460> 5816<00:01:15.390> when

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
correct loop number on these 5816 when

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929 
correct loop number on these 5816 when
they're<00:01:15.810> being<00:01:16.200> used<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.740> themselves<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
they're being used by themselves it's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
they're being used by themselves it's
gonna<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> loop<00:01:18.479> 2<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
gonna be a loop 2 so once you have that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
gonna be a loop 2 so once you have that
done<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.689> change<00:01:21.960> whether<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.380> going

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
done you can change whether it's going

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
done you can change whether it's going
to<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> door<00:01:23.009> window<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.850> change<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to be a door window you can change the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
to be a door window you can change the
description<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.470> forth<00:01:25.770> we'll

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
description so on and so forth we'll

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
description so on and so forth we'll
leave<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> front<00:01:27.360> door<00:01:27.509> contact<00:01:28.020> from

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
leave it as a front door contact from

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.170 
leave it as a front door contact from
here<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.460> finished<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:30.060> gonna

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
here when you're finished you're gonna

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
save if you have more sensors to program

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
save if you have more sensors to program
in<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.720> click<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> next<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.500> so
