00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.819
 so welcome to a little tutorial 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.710
 namely to show a little bit 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.030
 how i record like i watch my videos 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 edited like everything here at all 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.870
 The first thing that comes about is the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.850
 necessary programs 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.650
 no, first of all, hardware needed 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.500
 I use your live gamer board 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 becomes a very nice and small one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 Video Grabber you everywhere 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.519
 can take you because you want the thing 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 is not in your pants pocket 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 and anyway I can with it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.829
 You can generally use up to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 1080p record but I do not do it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.910
 420 we are fully satisfied 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 Software apps you have to have, of course 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.700
 also shown here you can see that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 you can set it all off as well 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.820
 always 121 alternatively one can also over 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 these are used the number 23 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 I like it better 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.600
 then even the game 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 Of course you also need to record 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 in the program to display that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 that is with me ari central that was with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.479
 the live gamer portable included 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.460
 been 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.790
 Accordingly , that's for 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 usually on my second monitor in 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 full screen so that almost directly in synonymous 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.060
 the size is recorded that is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.229
 I think 1920 x 1080 recorded 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.049
 and I'll edit that later 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 720p down so if I am here now 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.229
 Just a little bit 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.970
 by the playstation i am ruling it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.250
 this window is not for play because 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 that has a slight delay if I 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.430
 now i push to the side and that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.400
 is very beautiful, it may be 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.500
 a second delay about behind it 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.680
 I'm already looking directly from the console 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.380
 or transition over the graves to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 console to the tv and that works 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.310
 simply in the background that is the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.299
 recorded the sound here too take 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 I agree I take that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.270
 both separately on the better 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 to be able to coordinate with each other 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.850
 after this is recorded here goes 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.049
 it then also at the processing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.490
 but I will now first again 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.890
 in short, just a little bit 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.340
 record of this and we'll see you then 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.270
 right back in the editing so the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 recording are there 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.770
 that's just the recording of the same 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.220
 here is the sound recording to the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.620
 we will now process in sony vegas 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 so here we have sony vegas nice 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.080
 Editing program a bit expensive but it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.900
 it's worth it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 i have it sony vegas pro 9 though it is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.739
 a bit old I think there are already 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.120
 ivegas 11 but I'm coming with that very much 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.280
 well, that's why it uses that too 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.269
 continue to do so and then we take ourselves 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.319
 but just now at the moment 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.420
 First of all, I have different ones 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.370
 templates lifted the volume 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.019
 to adapt to, for example, a 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.920
 attitude when I pokémon black 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.510
 make 1 fit everything possible and such and 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.860
 david peace we open 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.330
 but just the wallabies template 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.519
 Matinees in it is just us 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.910
 mainly for the volume 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.209
 so take and the tutorial recording yes 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.620
 sometimes I give the funny name 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.720
 why not here yet to the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.130
 Sound recording to make this a little shorter 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.530
 because I started a little later but 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.959
 to record sound but it is likely 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.840
 about as fold my settings 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.370
 First and foremost, the picture was one 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530
 a bit wider medium already filled 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.280
 is what I do with it 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.320
 looks more beautiful 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
 I can make the picture a little 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.989
 every little bit she stops too 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.280
 Accordingly beautiful and for the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.739
 Completed a little everything so far 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.890
 hides so much anyway 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.299
 important is what i always do 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 separate audio and video track and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.329
 it shifts everything so my little one 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.530
 Pie because otherwise it would be 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.510
 pretty much so in chronicle just can 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.470
 pay attention to how it looks like when 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.470
 it would be unedited now 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.859
 you notice or I definitely notice 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.140
 the first sound comes and then comes 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.000
 more or less the shift from 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.200
 That's why I usually just try it that way 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.780
 a little bit out by now 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.409
 times that's almost what I usually 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.450
 like here to six and a half strokes 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:15.439
 the almost straight quite well 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.850
 I would say that fits very well now 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.799
 Let's go where I start too 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.329
 speak 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.039
 blah blah blah blah blah we click the 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.500
 just go through the menu completely wild and 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.280
 Let's just look at the characters 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.919
 have always been uncomfortable on the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.810
 friend's gallery watching us but 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.300
 a little bit of rock will watch when we 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.610
 because everything in his circle is just for him 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.160
 doctor yes I think that fits very well 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.720
 Everything has been adjusted here 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.970
 that it is also synchronous that it is from the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.410
 volume fits me all this here 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.620
 right here is still a bit 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.699
 that too the sound at the end 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.949
 schönaus is talking and not just that 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.680
 image represents such a that at the end of also 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:59.090
 not too much was almost over shows 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.960
 I do not think of anything like that and then we want 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.789
 Let's have a look stronger and see 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.460
 A man by the rye is watching 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.900
 When is everything in circles for only 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.159
 that sometimes I have to 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.169
 a few fine adjustments 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:16.010
 but otherwise do we have then 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.530
 So you see now has in conclusion 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.659
 seen that picture and sound are at least 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.020
 at the same time something so endangered so 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.039
 Now we have our 24 second file 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.270
 I would save help first 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.560
 everything so I first edit everything 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.220
 save and then I just run 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.039
 successively 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.039
 I could just change that now 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:38.110
 is mostly about a template here with 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:44.180
 1280 x 720 with let me have a look 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:47.030
 4 mbit / s contents the setting audio 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.320
 here in the settings has the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.000
 Most of my projects then rendered 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.370
 I give the stop accordingly 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.810
 names rennende everything going on drill 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.930
 finished is the result yes that was so 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.020
 pretty much everything to mine about mine 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.449
 recording tutorial if you have questions 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.969
 my comments with it 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.289
 but first of all, actually 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.150
 what questions are where will you have 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.779
 do you write did you want that heer 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.180
 it costs that 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.770
 there is google that goes a lot 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.930
 faster than that I just fine it 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.889
 does not go much faster but you can 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.960
 yes, a little self-reliance 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.159
 expect them if you like them 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.159
 small questions always has fast 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.569
 could then look for the ask 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.219
 why does not me work for me 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.409
 I do not know, but I use it 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.389
 I can not do that, I can not 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.889
 just do not answer because I do not 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.809
 your pc scanner and you have to 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.129
 probably not synonymous bc data 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.509
 because I do not care 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.919
 because i can not really think of pcs 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.330
 unknowing I know exactly how many 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.789
 others what you just yourself 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.139
 with a little google 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.029
 I google the world at all 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.479
 if anything needs looking for 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:50.650
 google searches for it properly because if 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.150
 If you are looking for the right one then you will find it too 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.529
 What you need google has almost always 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.479
 the solution unless you are looking for 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:57.159
 any exotic things as well 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.629
 always otherwise if you still ask 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:01.060
 forgot something but to 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:03.460
 Write write me write me 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.599
 we found the video that I sometimes too 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.629
 have explained a bit like me like that 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.949
 record that is all on the 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.439
 recordings with the grammer with the live 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.089
 gamer portable stop shots per 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.629
 Emulators are not really big 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:15.639
 different 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.110
 we say that the video file is wrong 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.749
 came from ebola tor 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.949
 which is recorded directly and also 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.779
 that's just right here 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.219
 soundfile is kept separate as always 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.999
 added just right in the morning 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:27.520
 adjust 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:29.620
 because I think you should at one 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.089
 let's play primarily the let's play 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.370
 years and not the game the game 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:36.669
 should be good to hear in the background 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.879
 but you should be the person before that much 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:42.729
 can hear better understandable 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:45.310
 because if you have the game too loud and 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.529
 the typical hears then I can not do it 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.060
 Do not know exactly what did 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.529
 I do not see it from there I play or 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.839
 I play because I types of me because what 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.550
 want to tell to the other way when the 

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:59.139
 player is too loud and the game too 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.270
 quietly yes I would like to hear something from both 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.990
 from therefore 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.360
 that's why it's always here 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.129
 Separate adaptation is a bit 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.860
 more work but I think it's worth it 

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:13.379
 well what about my page 

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.379
 thanks for watching and then
