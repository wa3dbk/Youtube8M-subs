00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.500
 the real had to win to be a champion but he started losing to the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.120
 38 minutes 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.600
 of the second half a goal by a dagger through the penalty line by the scoreboard 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.410
 osasuna 1-real Madrid 0 and then the panorama was complicated training 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.250
 Real Madrid press / m 1 in his visit to Pamplona 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.859
 great definition of dagger to put the ball in the bottom of the bow 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.819
 and then the osasuna could be 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.929
 to win 1 for 0 to the Pamplona team wanted to give an obstacle on the way 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:37.250
 for the victory of the Real Madrid definitive victory in the league 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.640
 in the Spanish league iker Casillas could not 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.520
 stop the dagger shot and then the osasuna seemed headed for 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.190
 get an important victory almost makes regret like this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.580
 because it was day they were all sure to celebrate the title 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.790
 but dagger was with this goal to put the complicated things for the formation 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.540
 Real Madrid when there were only six minutes left until the end 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.670
 I was winning the osasuna formation 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.940
 kilos 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.100
 However, when he was in Real Madrid at the most difficult moment 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.219
 arjen roben 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.219
 the head and the goal of Real Madrid 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010
 it was time 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.520
 so in the minute 42 of the game the Real Madrid formation was already putting 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.810
 in parity one by one I was at the score and I thought 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.190
 to compose things after the villarreal and had won his match in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.270
 the morning 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.870
 in real madrid the score was one by one things were 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.620
 in the visit to pamplona 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.610
 and it was missing more because Real Madrid wanted to celebrate this Sunday in one 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.720
 one 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.320
 and so you got to the minute 43 that reacts Real Madrid 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.850
 see in this play in the midfield of the white set won the movement of 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.940
 the formation of Real Madrid that arrived with desire grants the title 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.010
 due to the high action that comes open for pugita higuaín gonzalo that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.889
 hits and towards the goal 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.889
 of Real Madrid to the goal of the title 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.120
 despite the goal of higuaín and pipita that put the ball at the bottom of the goal 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.450
 I cheered them if they squared because in this way with the victory to Real Madrid 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
