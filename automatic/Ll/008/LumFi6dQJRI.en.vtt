his<00:02:30.860> writing<00:02:31.860> practice<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.730> started

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
his writing practice there and started

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.500 
his writing practice there and started
writing<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.080> side<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:35.299> Rick<00:02:36.299> Lewis

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
writing on the side of it Rick Lewis

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
writing on the side of it Rick Lewis
yeah<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.070> lever<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.549> just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
yeah it is it's got this lever is just

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.229 
yeah it is it's got this lever is just
loud<00:02:39.120> soft<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:43.200> don't<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.970> being

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
loud soft I really don't see that being

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.620 
loud soft I really don't see that being
a<00:02:45.739> write<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:47.010> feature<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.030> instrument<00:02:48.450> but

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
a write up feature on the instrument but

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.770 
a write up feature on the instrument but
put<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.079> wall<00:02:49.410> wise<00:02:49.620> very<00:02:49.980> cool<00:02:50.220> that's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
put that wall wise very cool that's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
put that wall wise very cool that's
certainly<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.380> wawas<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
certainly one of the first wawas that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.259 
certainly one of the first wawas that
I've<00:02:53.549> seen<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.420> an<00:02:55.170> instrument<00:02:55.859> this<00:02:55.950> whole

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
I've seen in an instrument this whole

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.310 
I've seen in an instrument this whole
how<00:02:57.269> old<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.540> think<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.260> don't

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
how old do you think this is I don't

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.930 
how old do you think this is I don't
know<00:02:58.910> 60s<00:02:59.910> 50s<00:03:00.720> or<00:03:01.109> 60s<00:03:01.230> yeah<00:03:01.680> probably<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.790> may

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
know 60s 50s or 60s yeah probably it may

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.449 
know 60s 50s or 60s yeah probably it may
be<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.090> 50s<00:03:03.510> instrument<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:05.040> could<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.400> should

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
be a 50s instrument it could we should

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.250 
be a 50s instrument it could we should
actually<00:03:05.820> research<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.540> should<00:03:06.720> research<00:03:07.079> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
actually research it should research it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
actually research it should research it
buy<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:07.980> two<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.280> these<00:03:08.370> actually

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
buy it we have two of these actually

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.520 
buy it we have two of these actually
this<00:03:09.180> one's<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.810> fellow<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.200> New<00:03:10.320> York

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
this one's going to a fellow in New York

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
this one's going to a fellow in New York
who<00:03:10.739> about<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.319> last

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
who about it and so this is the last

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
who about it and so this is the last
we'll<00:03:13.799> see<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.220> around<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.670> but<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:14.940> have

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
we'll see of it around here but we have

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.750 
we'll see of it around here but we have
another<00:03:15.299> one<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.769> need<00:03:16.769> another<00:03:17.190> how's<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
another one that need another how's the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.819 
another one that need another how's the
cord<00:03:18.000> cut<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.750> probably<00:03:18.989> bad<00:03:19.260> lower<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
cord cut so it's probably bad lower and

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.069 
cord cut so it's probably bad lower and
you<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.280> need<00:03:20.970> some<00:03:21.239> cleaning<00:03:21.600> out<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.959> the

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
you know need some cleaning out of the

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.660 
you know need some cleaning out of the
reeds<00:03:22.290> typically<00:03:22.680> stuff<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.100> gets<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
reeds typically stuff that gets in the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.039 
reeds typically stuff that gets in the
reeds<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.600> clean<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.840> out

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
reeds and you just have to clean it out

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.319 
reeds and you just have to clean it out
underneath<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.579> get<00:03:27.120> all<00:03:27.239> this

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
underneath and back you get all this

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.030 
underneath and back you get all this
stuff<00:03:27.450> off<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.019> down<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.590> there<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:28.889> can

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
stuff off and down in there you can

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.400 
stuff off and down in there you can
underneath<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.180> board<00:03:30.389> you'll<00:03:30.930> find<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
underneath the board you'll find that

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.590
