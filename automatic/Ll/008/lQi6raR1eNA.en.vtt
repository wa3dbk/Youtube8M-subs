being<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.500> N<00:02:14.100> key<00:02:14.670> roller<00:02:15.209> function<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.959> some

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
being a N key roller function and some

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.710 
being a N key roller function and some
of<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> might<00:02:17.250> know<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.730> anti-ghosting

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
of you might know it as anti-ghosting

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.560 
of you might know it as anti-ghosting
and<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:20.489> basically<00:02:20.669> means<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.419> can

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and it basically means that you can

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.810 
and it basically means that you can
press<00:02:21.810> as<00:02:22.019> many<00:02:22.440> buttons<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.639> and

press as many buttons as you want and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.550 
press as many buttons as you want and
all<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.269> keystrokes<00:02:24.690> will<00:02:24.870> still<00:02:25.079> register

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
all the keystrokes will still register

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.979 
all the keystrokes will still register
and<00:02:26.459> another<00:02:26.970> thing<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.329> we're<00:02:27.419> proud<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> is

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
and another thing that we're proud of is

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.539

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
that this thing has got a polling rate

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.030 
that this thing has got a polling rate
of<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.090> thousand<00:02:30.780> Hertz<00:02:30.989> which<00:02:31.320> makes<00:02:31.889> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
of one thousand Hertz which makes this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800 
of one thousand Hertz which makes this
key<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.459> eight<00:02:32.820> times<00:02:33.090> faster<00:02:33.389> than
