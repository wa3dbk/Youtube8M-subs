00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
in this video I like to explain how to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.440 
in this video I like to explain how to
make<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.720> quality<00:00:04.260> crimp<00:00:04.560> with<00:00:04.649> a<00:00:04.710> hand<00:00:05.010> tool

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
make a quality crimp with a hand tool

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.299 
make a quality crimp with a hand tool
you've<00:00:06.450> obviously<00:00:06.810> chosen<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.379> terminal<00:00:07.919> that

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
you've obviously chosen a terminal that

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.959 
you've obviously chosen a terminal that
you<00:00:08.370> want<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> crimp<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.629> each<00:00:09.780> terminal<00:00:10.969> we

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
you want to crimp and each terminal we

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.760 
you want to crimp and each terminal we
have<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.180> specific<00:00:12.570> hand<00:00:13.110> tool<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.650> will

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
have a specific hand tool that will

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.859 
have a specific hand tool that will
crimp<00:00:14.039> that<00:00:14.100> terminal<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.150> each<00:00:15.299> hand<00:00:15.660> tool

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
crimp that terminal and each hand tool

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.650 
crimp that terminal and each hand tool
has<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> specification<00:00:17.100> sheet<00:00:17.400> shown<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:18.030> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
has a specification sheet shown here and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.170 
has a specification sheet shown here and
that<00:00:19.050> specification<00:00:19.470> sheet<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.850> should<00:00:21.030> be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that specification sheet you should be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.610 
that specification sheet you should be
able<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> find<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> terminal<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.440> want

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
able to find the terminal that you want

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.940 
able to find the terminal that you want
to<00:00:22.680> crimp<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:24.180> lists<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> wire<00:00:24.870> gauge<00:00:25.530> range

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
to crimp it lists the wire gauge range

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.310 
to crimp it lists the wire gauge range
in<00:00:26.310> which<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.789> terminal<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.360> accept<00:00:27.780> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in which that terminal will accept and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.100 
in which that terminal will accept and
it'll<00:00:28.740> also<00:00:29.039> list<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.000> insulation<00:00:30.539> diameter

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
it'll also list the insulation diameter

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.920 
it'll also list the insulation diameter
that<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.830> terminal<00:00:32.250> will<00:00:32.399> accept<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.910> well<00:00:33.120> an

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that the terminal will accept as well an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530 
that the terminal will accept as well an
important<00:00:34.320> factor<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.680> remember<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
important factor to remember is that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.770 
important factor to remember is that
each<00:00:36.690> terminal<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:38.210> specific<00:00:39.210> wire<00:00:39.420> gauge

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
each terminal has specific wire gauge

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.040 
each terminal has specific wire gauge
range<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.670> crimp<00:00:41.970> in<00:00:42.810> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
range here that it can crimp in this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.100 
range here that it can crimp in this
particular<00:00:43.350> example<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.130> have<00:00:44.280> three<00:00:45.110> crimp

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
particular example we have three crimp

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.610 
particular example we have three crimp
profiles<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.460> hand<00:00:47.790> tool<00:00:48.590> make<00:00:49.590> sure

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
profiles in our hand tool make sure

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.520 
profiles in our hand tool make sure
you're<00:00:50.190> using<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.820> proper<00:00:51.059> crimp<00:00:51.809> profile

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you're using the proper crimp profile

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
you're using the proper crimp profile
with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.010> wire<00:00:53.280> gauge<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.880> you've<00:00:54.030> selected

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
with the wire gauge that you've selected

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
with the wire gauge that you've selected
the<00:00:57.260> hand<00:00:58.260> tool<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.950> here<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.280> three

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the hand tool as you see here has three

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180 
the hand tool as you see here has three
crimp<00:00:59.879> profiles<00:01:00.450> again<00:01:01.079> matching<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
crimp profiles again matching the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
crimp profiles again matching the
profile<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.910> wire<00:01:03.180> gauge<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
profile to the wire gauge that you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.609 
profile to the wire gauge that you
selected<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.829> critical<00:01:05.990> another<00:01:06.990> area<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
selected is critical another area to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.160 
selected is critical another area to
look<00:01:07.859> at<00:01:08.069> is<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.670> strip<00:01:08.939> length<00:01:09.179> making<00:01:09.869> sure

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
look at is the strip length making sure

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.649 
look at is the strip length making sure
that<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.369> proper<00:01:11.850> size<00:01:12.149> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that that is the proper size is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.230 
that that is the proper size is
important<00:01:13.259> again<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.829> crimp<00:01:14.159> quality<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
important again to crimp quality but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.699 
important again to crimp quality but
make<00:01:15.359> sure<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.689> you're<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.229> nicking

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:16.709 
make sure that you're not nicking

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.800 
make sure that you're not nicking
strands<00:01:17.249> make<00:01:17.729> sure<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.329> insulation

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
strands make sure that the insulation

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
strands make sure that the insulation
shoulder<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.649> nice<00:01:19.889> and<00:01:20.100> square<00:01:20.249> and<00:01:20.999> you're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
shoulder is nice and square and you're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
shoulder is nice and square and you're
not<00:01:21.299> getting<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> stringers<00:01:22.439> when<00:01:23.039> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
not getting a lot of stringers when you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.199 
not getting a lot of stringers when you
strip<00:01:23.399> that<00:01:23.779> insulation<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> another<00:01:26.789> area<00:01:27.149> to

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
strip that insulation so another area to
