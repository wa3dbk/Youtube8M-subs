00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.860

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.300

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.189

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.919

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.470

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.250
 from my point of view then that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 wants to look for a palette that was good 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 that has enough shadows and now 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.390

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.410
 totally framing my idea for 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 sigh a little and the price does not 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.370

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.769
 because if they are going to take the colors 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.950
 simple that the colors are new 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.799
 with the most earth the simplest 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.239
 then with this palette the colors that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.239
 there's now I'm going to teach 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:07.800

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.270
 plastics of colors and where you can 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.270
 see in the name 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.480
 then you open it and has within it 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 like a plastic that bank if I go to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.770
 then goes this plastic that puts you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.390
 the ones that obviously the names that I read 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.550
 but now I have left it does not bother me 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.450
 and well you will see that some are a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.620
 a little more 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.080

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.130
 here you have the colors as you see 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.100
 the colors are very 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.080
 good very basic very wearable 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.240
 then because I used this palette 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.840
 because they go earth colors go colors 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.230
 very claritos to illuminate go colors 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.640
 green many green that I what more 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.040

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.010
 I have eyes like that, little nerds, ah, well, no, 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.690
 I have honey color pulling green pardos 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:44.020
 own and then good I fall in love that 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.030
 outside earth colors with the warm ones 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 and blue and green tones and then the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.400
 typical gray and black 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.000
 then I'm going to teach him again 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.630
 that you can see the full range of colors 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.300
 as here you see this clash is from the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.580
 brush 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.380
 and well, take your brush to apply 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.020
 but this is the truth 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.870
 do not use it 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.379
 Take this and what is used in the eyes 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.110
 that I wear today wears colors very 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:18.230

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.120

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.490
 that they will serve me and that I believed that 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.280
 money will not invest me well I say 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.080

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.889
