00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:04.504
 (knocking) 

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.643
 Oh, hi buddy, come in 

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:06.826
 Welcome to my apartment 

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.227
 I just had my apartment completely remodeled 

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:11.682
 by my girls Mary and Leah from A Fab life. 

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.656
 They got so many things 

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:15.860
 from my favorite stores and flea markets 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.579
 and AP2B.com, and I was like "Oh my God", 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.981
 "I love it here" 

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.433
 I was doing an apartment tour in San Francisco 

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.758
 you all loved it, so I thought 

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:24.381
 "You know what I need to do a new apartment tour 

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:27.212
 "Now that I live in LA in such a wonderful apartment". 

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.394
 So let's do it. 

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:31.345
 Oh, hey, welcome to my room. 

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:36.024
 Here, where all the magic takes place (laughs) 

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:37.668
 I have no excuse for this. 

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:39.470
 As you can see, I'm a little obsessed 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.954
 British boys, I just love a nice accent, 

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:44.790
 and attractive men. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.853
 But, there's one exception, 

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.795
 and this is the man who made it to the wall 

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.373
 among all British boys, 

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.522
 my only one (mumbles). 

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:55.054
 Okay, so this shelf is a pile 

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.434
 the decorations and things I have accumulated over the years 

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.140
 fortune cookies I have accumulated 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.823
 the look sent to me by The Trevor Project 

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:02.356
 when i made my first video about him 

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.292
 so they sent it to me. 

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.185
 Every time I go to Disneyland, 

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.170
 I have to have a cap and these are mine. 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.328
 Okay, now, let's check my closet. 

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:10.067
 My sweatshirts and sweaters, 

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:12.367
 and my vision board, and my jeans 

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.257
 and all my short-sleeved shirts, 

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:17.497
 a pile of shirts and everything. 

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:20.045
 Everything you saw me wear 

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.545
 he's from this room. 

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:25.167
 Now let's go to my office. 

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.942
 Here's a video shoot, and maybe you know this, 

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.509
 it was the background of my old videos. 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.402
 Sometimes I shoot, sometimes not. 

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:32.968
 But here's all shearing. 

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.324
 Here's my living room, as I said, 

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:40.248
 all made by Mary and Leah of A Fab Life 

00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.488
 they knew exactly what I wanted. 

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:44.880
 I told them I wanted it to be "Grandma's chic" 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.857
 and a bunch of decorations and things 

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.243
 and scattered and fluted, 

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:51.727
 and something my grandmother and my grandpa could have 

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:54.770
 in their apartment, if they were cool, 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.372
 so that was the goal, I think they really did, 

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:59.971
 so let's go a little deeper. 

00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:01.626
 At first I was really nervous 

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.345
 buy a couch because i thought "i don't know 

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:04.564
 how to set that room. " 

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:06.805
 But we bought this couch at AptB.com, 

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.139
 and I absolutely adore him. 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.490
 I want something that people can just lose 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.739
 and lie down, and have the comfort to be entertained, 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.375
 I want to have an apartment that is just 

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.907
 fun and casual. 

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.462
 So we bought this, I love it, 

00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:21.937
 we bought these different pillows, 

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:23.331
 each from a different place. 

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.204
 When we thought about it, 

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:26.318
 how to decorate this couch 

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:27.331
 we bought all these pillows, 

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.435
 and I said, "We have to give something here." 

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.851
 and the girls at A Fab Life were like, 

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.350
 "This will be amazing." 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.335
 I didn't know what their plan was like 

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:35.843
 but now that it's on my couch 

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.532
 I don't know how I could live without it. 

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.378
 I'm impressed by it, I think it's from Ikea. 

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:43.772
 And as I said, I really like the flock pattern. 

00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:47.945
 But it's not just a flowered pattern that I'm obsessed with. 

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.084
 I'm also obsessed with antlers. 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.953
 Finally, I'm also obsessed with globes. 

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:58.510
 I bought this turntable on Fab.com, 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.508
 and I fell in love with him 

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:01.204
 and I never had any boards, 

00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:02.422
 but when I bought my turntable, 

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:04.467
 I said to myself, "Okay, I have to start looking for more records." 

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.446
 So, every time I go to a flea market, 

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:09.366
 I'm going to buy some records, and I have a mini collection here 

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:12.110
 just a few albums 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.719
 which I love now, the albums I loved before, 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.900
 and I just let it go. I love my environment. 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.072
 And finally, I have a small reading corner here, 

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:21.453
 to fill the room. 

00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:22.591
 Okay, when you saw the rest of the apartment, 

00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:25.273
 come check out the kitchen. 

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:26.876
 We have a classic kitchen 

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.872
 you might know when I did 

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:30.672
 My Drunk Kitchen with Hannah Hart. 

00:03:30.672 --> 00:03:33.016
 It has cookbooks, my radio, 

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:35.258
 my coffee machine and a lot of photos 

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:37.115
 I've collected over the years 

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:40.471
 from Youtube events, my best friend from San Francisco, 

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.490
 and a pile of Darren Criss magnets, 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.085
 you can change outfit, it's pretty dense. 

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.302
 And my mom, as you can see, 

00:03:47.302 --> 00:03:49.508
 is the best, i love her 

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:51.424
 and the magnet my mom gave me is there: 

00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:52.469
 "Waiting for the right guy, 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.208
 meanwhile, fun with the bad ones. " 

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:59.191
 And then, I'm on the fridge 

00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:01.489
 a pile of photos I have accumulated 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.034
 during those years on Instagram. 

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.345
 I found a page where you can make magnets 

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.830
 of all your Instagram photos 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.767
 so here are some of my favorite people 

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.546
 favorite memories, and lots 

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:12.692
 people you might know. 

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:14.469
 I don't know, a lot of youtubers are there. 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.465
 And then, every time I drank 

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:21.027
 a bottle of wine, I left my cork. 

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.930
 So here they are. 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.553
 I drink a lot, and I won't apologize for it. 

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:27.912
 Okay, this is my new apartment tour, 

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:30.129

 while they put him together. 

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:43.998

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:06.076
 Thank you, people, much for engagement, 

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:07.759
 and see you next week. 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.482
 Okay, hi!
