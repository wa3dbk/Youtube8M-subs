00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the field you know the only thing that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
the field you know the only thing that
we<00:02:18.000> could<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.390> refill<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> river<00:02:19.080> stream

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
we could do is refill a river stream

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.510 
we could do is refill a river stream
lake<00:02:19.530> or<00:02:19.680> pond<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> only<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.430> we

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
lake or pond and the only way that we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.370 
lake or pond and the only way that we
could<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.210> if<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.450> were<00:02:21.570> using<00:02:21.810> iodine

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
could do that is if we were using iodine

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.840 
could do that is if we were using iodine
tablets<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.920> iodine<00:02:23.220> tablets<00:02:23.340> we're<00:02:23.700> one

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.390 
really a functional thing in that way
but<00:04:23.200> now<00:04:23.350> I'm<00:04:23.470> going<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.680> change<00:04:23.950> this<00:04:24.160> system

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
but now I'm going to change this system

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.060 
but now I'm going to change this system
I'm<00:04:24.880> gonna<00:04:25.060> supercharge<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.990> by<00:04:26.560> connecting

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'm gonna supercharge this by connecting

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.710 
I'm gonna supercharge this by connecting
it<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.310> geigerrig<00:04:27.670> pressurized<00:04:28.270> hydration

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
it to a geigerrig pressurized hydration

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.450 
it to a geigerrig pressurized hydration
system<00:04:29.050> now<00:04:29.260> as<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.470> pressurize<00:04:29.890> this<00:04:30.250> you'll

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
system now as I pressurize this you'll

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.980 
system now as I pressurize this you'll
see<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.730> there's<00:04:30.940> no<00:04:31.090> air<00:04:31.240> again<00:04:31.540> going<00:04:31.840> into

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
see that there's no air again going into

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.260 
see that there's no air again going into
that<00:04:32.170> chamber<00:04:32.440> you'll<00:04:32.830> recall<00:04:33.100> there's<00:04:34.000> going

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
that chamber you'll recall there's going

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
that chamber you'll recall there's going
into<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> separate<00:04:34.900> chamber<00:04:35.050> which

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
into a separate chamber which

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.030 
into a separate chamber which
pressurizes<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.040> geigerrig<00:04:36.460> system<00:04:36.910> now

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
pressurizes the geigerrig system now

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.110 
pressurizes the geigerrig system now
imagine<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:39.640> pack<00:04:39.850> you've

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
imagine that this is in your pack you've

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.350 
imagine that this is in your pack you've
got<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> nice<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.750> pressurized<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:42.360> whoops

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
got a nice and pressurized and whoops

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.690 
got a nice and pressurized and whoops
turn<00:04:44.140> this<00:04:44.260> thing<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.710> off<00:04:44.860> position<00:04:45.040> it's

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
turn this thing in the off position it's

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.570 
turn this thing in the off position it's
got<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.850> flush<00:04:46.150> system<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.600> back<00:04:46.780> flush<00:04:46.990> system

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
got a flush system a back flush system

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.430 
got a flush system a back flush system
and<00:04:48.580> now<00:04:48.730> I<00:04:48.760> pressurize<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.750> system<00:04:50.260> now

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and now I pressurize that system now

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.350 
and now I pressurize that system now
instead<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.890> having<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.220> suck<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.910> water<00:04:52.030> so

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
instead of having to suck the water so

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.050 
instead of having to suck the water so
hard<00:04:52.570> like<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.870> were<00:04:53.020> before<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:54.250> water<00:04:54.520> is

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
hard like we were before that water is

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.610 
hard like we were before that water is
pushed<00:04:55.450> right<00:04:55.660> through<00:04:55.900> that<00:04:55.990> filter<00:04:56.410> that

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
pushed right through that filter that

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.590 
pushed right through that filter that
individual<00:04:57.520> operator<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.030> now<00:04:58.150> able<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.480> get

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
individual operator is now able to get

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.390 
individual operator is now able to get
water<00:04:58.810> plug<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.650> play<00:04:59.830> on<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.160> gun<00:05:00.280> you're

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
water plug and play on the gun you're

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.470 
water plug and play on the gun you're
gonna<00:05:00.490> see<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.850> just<00:05:01.060> filling<00:05:01.300> up<00:05:01.360> the

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
gonna see that just filling up the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.300 
gonna see that just filling up the
filter<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.020> then<00:05:02.590> now<00:05:02.740> we're<00:05:02.890> getting<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.190> nice

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
filter and then now we're getting a nice

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.790 
filter and then now we're getting a nice
steady<00:05:03.670> flow<00:05:03.940> out<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.600> reservoir<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.590> now

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
steady flow out of the reservoir and now

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.080 
steady flow out of the reservoir and now
all<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.160> water<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.580> find<00:05:06.820> along<00:05:07.030> the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
all the water that I find along the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.970 
all the water that I find along the
trail<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.630> now<00:05:07.840> readily<00:05:08.140> available<00:05:08.290> for<00:05:08.860> my

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
use through that p2 48 builder and I'm

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.710 
use through that p2 48 builder and I'm
getting<00:05:13.660> plenty<00:05:13.780> of<00:05:13.990> water<00:05:15.390> plenty<00:05:16.390> of<00:05:16.570> water

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
getting plenty of water plenty of water

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.420 
getting plenty of water plenty of water
to<00:05:16.810> drink<00:05:17.050> through<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.740> system<00:05:18.040> you<00:05:18.070> can<00:05:18.280> see

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
to drink through that system you can see

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.610 
to drink through that system you can see
a<00:05:18.460> nice<00:05:18.640> steady<00:05:18.910> flow<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.110> changes<00:05:20.560> the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
a nice steady flow so that changes the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.980 
a nice steady flow so that changes the
dynamic<00:05:21.420> substantially<00:05:22.420> when<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.660> take<00:05:22.840> this
