spinal cord will not function well if
you<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.680> eat<00:00:35.010> carbohydrates<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:36.480> exactly

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you do not eat carbohydrates now exactly

you do not eat carbohydrates now exactly
what<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> car<00:00:38.450> carbs<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.750> things<00:00:40.020> like

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
what is a car carbs can be things like

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
bread and pasta and potatoes but they're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
bread and pasta and potatoes but they're

also fruits and vegetables and some
beans<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:47.850> think

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
beans and a lot of people just think

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
beans and a lot of people just think
bread<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> pasta<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.010> carbs

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
bread and pasta when they think carbs

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
bread and pasta when they think carbs
when<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.180> fruits<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> vegetables<00:00:52.350> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
when really fruits and vegetables can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
when really fruits and vegetables can
give<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> carbohydrates<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> need

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
give you the carbohydrates that you need

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.260 
give you the carbohydrates that you need
as<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> eat<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> carbohydrate

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
as well so when you eat a carbohydrate

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
as well so when you eat a carbohydrate
your<00:00:57.750> body<00:00:58.020> takes<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> breaks<00:00:59.399> them

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
your body takes them and breaks them

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.569 
your body takes them and breaks them
down<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.210> create<00:01:00.719> glucose<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.340> need

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
down and create glucose and you need

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
down and create glucose and you need
that<00:01:02.760> glucose<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.780> blood<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.500> order<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that glucose in your blood in order to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
that glucose in your blood in order to
function<00:01:05.430> well<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.600> also<00:01:06.840> takes<00:01:07.290> these

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
function well it also takes these

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.160 
function well it also takes these
carbohydrates<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.520> stores<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.450> energy

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
carbohydrates and stores in it as energy

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.710 
carbohydrates and stores in it as energy
in<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.710> liver<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.670> muscles<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.600> if

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
in your liver and in your muscles so if

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
in your liver and in your muscles so if
you<00:01:12.840> exercise<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.460> need<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> eat

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you exercise you really do need to eat

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
you exercise you really do need to eat
carbs<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.229> problem<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
carbs the problem is is that a lot of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.260 
carbs the problem is is that a lot of
people<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.420> eating<00:01:18.630> an<00:01:18.960> overabundance<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
people are eating an overabundance of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
people are eating an overabundance of
carbohydrates<00:01:21.270> especially<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> form<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
carbohydrates especially in the form of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
carbohydrates especially in the form of
processed<00:01:23.400> foods<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.030> baked<00:01:24.420> goods<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
processed foods and baked goods and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
processed foods and baked goods and
different<00:01:25.860> breads<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.670> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> pasta<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
different breads and a lot of pasta and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
different breads and a lot of pasta and
that's<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.470> we're<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.920> wrong<00:01:29.240> another

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that's where we're going wrong another

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
that's where we're going wrong another
thing<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> happens<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.439> carbohydrates<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.969 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is
they<00:01:32.939> turn<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.420> glucose<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.770> body

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they turn into glucose and if your body

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
they turn into glucose and if your body
doesn't<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> turns<00:01:36.720> them<00:01:36.960> into

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
doesn't use them then it turns them into

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
doesn't use them then it turns them into
fat<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.729> stores<00:01:39.000> them<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.689> body<00:01:39.960> as

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
fat and it stores them in your body as

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.090 
fat and it stores them in your body as
fat<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.820> okay<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
fat so okay what are you going to do you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
fat so okay what are you going to do you
need<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> eat<00:01:44.579> carbs<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.090> energy<00:01:45.149> into

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
need to eat carbs for energy into

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
need to eat carbs for energy into
function<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.430> don't<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> eat<00:01:48.060> too

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
function but you don't want to eat too

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
function but you don't want to eat too
many<00:01:48.390> carbs<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> gain<00:01:49.560> weight<00:01:49.759> well

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
many carbs so that you gain weight well

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.270 
many carbs so that you gain weight well
follow<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.390> rules<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.159> have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
follow these rules and you will have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
follow these rules and you will have
enough<00:01:53.610> energy<00:01:53.790> from<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.299> carbohydrates

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
enough energy from your carbohydrates

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.760 
enough energy from your carbohydrates
without<00:01:55.530> gaining<00:01:55.799> weight<00:01:56.180> only<00:01:57.180> eat<00:01:57.780> starchy

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
without gaining weight only eat starchy

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.850 
without gaining weight only eat starchy
carbohydrates<00:01:59.729> after<00:02:00.390> activity<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> after

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
carbohydrates after activity and after

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.999 
carbohydrates after activity and after
work<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.409> suggest<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
work out so I don't like to suggest that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
work out so I don't like to suggest that
people<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.640> bread<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> pasta<00:02:06.479> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
people have bread and pasta because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900
