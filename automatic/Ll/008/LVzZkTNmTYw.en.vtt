 that here you have it 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.990
 The first thing we will do is process 260 grams of flour together with 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.329
 two teaspoons 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329

 reservations 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.850
 Let's reiterate the skin of a lemon and let's also hope that the consumption of that 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.560
 same year 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.730
 in a bowl we are going to beat 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.020
 two sets together with 100 grams of butter at room temperature 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.370
 Let's beat until we see what the butter come off 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.509

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.230
 50 grams of milk 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.950
 a spoonful or spoonful of vanilla essence and lemon juice and this 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.920
 we will remove it until we see forest of a pasture consistency that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 the butter has been undone a little 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.830
 now it's time to catch the navy we had drawn we make a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.570
 small volcano from the center and there from Moscow the sample that we had 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.790
 made by cheek fires and so on 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.990
 we are going to stir it until a paste remains without lumps 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.600
 pretty thin 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.030
 We prepare the molds for the muffins that are sold previously married 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.170
 mounts a silicone 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.729
 if we win the little rooms a lot until the final 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.169
 to top it off fine in that 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.689
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees after preheating 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.589
 panetta 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:27.209
 we close the doors and set the temperature to 190 180 for about 20 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.159
 minutes 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
