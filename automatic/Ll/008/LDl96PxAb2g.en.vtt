00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
going back into that same pool of poor
friends<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.310> let's<00:01:08.490> assume<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.090> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
friends so let's assume they're in that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
friends so let's assume they're in that
situation<00:01:09.600> where<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.560> believe<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
situation where they believe that a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.800 
situation where they believe that a
short-term<00:01:11.729> placement<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
short-term placement can make a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.210 
short-term placement can make a
difference<00:01:13.260> where<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:13.920> turn<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
difference where do they then turn to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.670 
difference where do they then turn to
get<00:01:14.549> help<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.270> figure<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.960> program<00:01:16.470> what
