00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.459
 okay and on we go 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.960
 there laughs 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.169
 this could be both technically and the victim no longer off 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.439
 come to the criticism 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.099
 Often we finally have managed to make it new 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.130
 but of course one more please 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 the SC finally managed my goodness 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.599
 which and wild 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
 world 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 and people this is the final blow 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
 important he finds his goal 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 much better 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 that depends 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.130
 angry 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 there 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 Decker actually 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.549
 he belongs to an organization 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.840
 First of all, they would have heartless different worlds together 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 here defeat these heartless and they get the guests with the heart 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 so the vicious circle never ends 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 Minute then a few 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.530
 we must turn the base and defeat it once and for all 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.780
 not much to get in these waters so it was not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 Finally help 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.600
 somehow 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 clear 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.800
 Trichet sends 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.750
 4 but as a lesson maybe I want to read this summer 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.469
 Troublemakers wreck meadows and the French can only 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.510
 to attempt 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.679
 they break the business for us pirates 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.900
 he was able to travel to Portugal 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.809
 In the future, the officials should have 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.809
 8 benefited others last was last 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.440
 what a pity 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 I actually thought that maybe I changed 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 by Manuel Brandenstein 21 into nothing 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.079
 the reward 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.799
 it's never about it 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.799
 for 1 beautiful beats 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.799
 So pointless so simple and came across certain h 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.659
 the happiness of the beautiful promise 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.149
 Rostock ddp Red 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.109
 yes it is true but one day I ask myself the question where its crew 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.639
 together and got Schwerdt until then, I also know and 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.989
 In this time comes her two kick-a buddy to forge Bonn 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.329
 Maybe it was the return of someday really nobody exclude 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.829
 Sword uses no 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.400
 have the right and so are just as common as you are not 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.009
 as you sure 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.620
 RTL 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.620
 the 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.069
 Some say Jack Sparrow is the worst pirate on the Caribbean coast 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.789
 but kicking 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:01.869
 because off 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.669
 we know that he is the best one sees soon Wiesbaden 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.429
 on 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:13.109
 Bern 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.560
 the war then too 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.560
 with Porto this year 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.120
 collects 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.999
 September 2011 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.999
 St 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.969
 St 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.939
 space 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.379
 Yes 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.999
 it is 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.999
 SID 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
 DAPD 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.409
 it was going to reduce a new episode 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.409
 the 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.789
 On paper, though, with having chosen to offer a home 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.159
 yes, I can not see that right now 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.569
 Seoul I'll check it again and I hope I can not 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.839
 but is so Rieger 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.259
 I would say 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.669
 to complete it 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.259
 Let's go there 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.400
 after agricultural construction 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.029
 and fulfill another task there 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.620
 but this 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.820
 but it does have a bit weird but I wanted the world of Jack 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.529
 Sparrow still finish in peace 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.270
 That's the end of this chapter 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.349
 and next time 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.090
 We promised to bid or as I said Ankara was when I got it 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.749
 being disempowered at that time will be nice says
