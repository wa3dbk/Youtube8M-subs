00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
better product from D&amp;D the thing I did

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.930

bicycle trying to keep that same vintage

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.620 
bicycle trying to keep that same vintage
feel<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.920> there<00:03:19.190> ace<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.520> spades<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:20.180> fact<00:03:20.540> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
feel in there ace of spades in fact a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.480 
feel in there ace of spades in fact a
lot<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.200> Heritage<00:03:21.560> decks<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:22.160> the

lot of the Heritage decks have the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.550 
lot of the Heritage decks have the
vegetation<00:03:23.120> space<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:23.600> Dan<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.200> Dave<00:03:24.350> did

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
vegetation space and Dan and Dave did

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.440 
vegetation space and Dan and Dave did
not<00:03:24.770> other<00:03:25.280> than<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.730> though<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.210> would

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
not other than that though I would

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.680 
not other than that though I would
probably<00:03:26.780> give<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.350> DND<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.420> case

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
probably give it to the DND in this case

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.470 
probably give it to the DND in this case
and<00:03:30.020> I<00:03:30.260> think<00:03:30.500> if<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.740> get<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> chance<00:03:31.480> these

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and I think if you get the chance these

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.210 
and I think if you get the chance these
