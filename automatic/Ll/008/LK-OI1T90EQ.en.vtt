00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.600 

I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.870> Israeli<00:00:56.380> students<00:00:56.860> are<00:00:57.190> very

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
I think Israeli students are very

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.020 
I think Israeli students are very
targeted<00:00:58.540> on<00:00:59.080> what<00:00:59.350> they<00:00:59.500> do<00:00:59.560> and<00:01:00.070> that's<00:01:00.730> also

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
targeted on what they do and that's also

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.610 
targeted on what they do and that's also
the<00:01:01.150> way<00:01:01.270> they<00:01:01.510> work<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:02.110> thinking<00:01:02.620> is<00:01:02.800> very

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
the way they work that thinking is very

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.800 
the way they work that thinking is very
the<00:01:05.620> pushing<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.280> edges<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.970> was<00:01:07.210> pushing

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
the pushing the edges that was pushing

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.140 
the pushing the edges that was pushing
the<00:01:07.960> boundaries<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.500> that<00:01:09.220> they<00:01:09.820> don't

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
the boundaries of that they don't

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.900 
the boundaries of that they don't
accept<00:01:10.540> every<00:01:10.930> answer<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:12.280> there's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
accept every answer as it is and there's

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.320 
accept every answer as it is and there's
a<00:01:13.000> lot<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.240> creativity<00:01:13.979> within<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.330> breaking

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
a lot of creativity within that breaking

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.700 
a lot of creativity within that breaking
the<00:01:16.479> boundaries<00:01:16.900> kind<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.650> approach<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the boundaries kind of approach the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.070 
the boundaries kind of approach the
thing<00:01:20.950> here<00:01:21.250> in<00:01:21.400> Israel<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.420> everybody

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
thing here in Israel is that everybody

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200 
thing here in Israel is that everybody
has<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.440> space<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.550> know<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.060> can
