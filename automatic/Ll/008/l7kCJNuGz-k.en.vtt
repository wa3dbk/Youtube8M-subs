00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
through through the cylinder and then

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.740 
through through the cylinder and then
you<00:01:21.700> use<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:22.930> skewers<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:25.180> gripe<00:01:25.600> I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
you use it as a skewers but one gripe I

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.380 
you use it as a skewers but one gripe I
have<00:01:25.780> about<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:27.039> if<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.700> your<00:01:27.729> it's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
have about this is if you have your it's

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.649 
have about this is if you have your it's
too<00:01:28.720> closely<00:01:29.050> spaced<00:01:29.679> see<00:01:30.640> how<00:01:30.789> I'm<00:01:30.970> skipping

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
too closely spaced see how I'm skipping

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.370 
too closely spaced see how I'm skipping
each<00:01:31.899> other<00:01:32.170> one<00:01:32.470> if<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.490> was<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.880> put<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
each other one if I was to put the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.830 
each other one if I was to put the
remaining<00:01:35.890> two<00:01:36.009> skewers<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:36.789> wouldn't<00:01:37.539> take

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
remaining two skewers you wouldn't take

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.139 
remaining two skewers you wouldn't take
it<00:01:37.869> all<00:01:38.050> it<00:01:38.259> just<00:01:38.710> wouldn't<00:01:38.950> fit<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.000> they

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
it all it just wouldn't fit so they

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.609 
it all it just wouldn't fit so they
space<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:40.780> out<00:01:41.340> too<00:01:42.340> close

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.099 

so<00:01:46.280> I'm<00:01:46.609> imagine<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:47.570> will<00:01:47.750> probably<00:01:47.899> take

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
so I'm imagine this will probably take

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.499 
so I'm imagine this will probably take
45<00:01:48.679> minutes<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.429> an<00:01:49.460> hour<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.000> be

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
45 minutes to an hour and this be

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.649 
45 minutes to an hour and this be
probably<00:01:51.219> 30<00:01:52.219> to<00:01:53.090> 40<00:01:53.509> minutes<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:56.390> will<00:01:56.509> see

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
probably 30 to 40 minutes so we will see

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.469 
probably 30 to 40 minutes so we will see
how<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.810> turns<00:01:56.929> out<00:01:57.380> once<00:01:57.859> it's<00:01:58.039> ready

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.950 

if<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.350> been<00:02:04.590> cooking<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
if this has been cooking you know it's a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.630 
if this has been cooking you know it's a
sound<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.149> why<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.450> making<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
sound so I don't know why is making that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.290 
sound so I don't know why is making that
it's<00:02:11.640> how<00:02:11.880> that's<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.270> turning<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:14.300> it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's how that's like turning and it it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's how that's like turning and it it
was<00:02:15.450> turning<00:02:15.720> clockwise<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
was turning clockwise and then it just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
was turning clockwise and then it just
pops<00:02:17.310> back<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.959> counterclockwise<00:02:19.550> see<00:02:20.550> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
pops back to counterclockwise see that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.460 
pops back to counterclockwise see that
so<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> don't<00:02:21.720> know<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:22.050> something<00:02:22.319> wrong

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so I don't know there's something wrong

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.240 
so I don't know there's something wrong
with<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.920> design<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
with the design of that one or just the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.920 
with the design of that one or just the
way<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.420> meat<00:02:27.660> anyway<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
way the meat anyway you can see that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.870 
way the meat anyway you can see that
it's<00:02:30.930> cooking<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.890> mean<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.250> been<00:02:32.430> cooking

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it's cooking I mean it's been cooking

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.449 
it's cooking I mean it's been cooking
for<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:34.580> 25<00:02:35.580> minutes<00:02:36.709> let<00:02:37.709> me<00:02:37.799> pop<00:02:38.010> open<00:02:38.190> this

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
for like 25 minutes let me pop open this

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
for like 25 minutes let me pop open this
so<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> believe<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.790> keep<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.510> top<00:02:42.780> on

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so I believe if you keep the top on

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
so I believe if you keep the top on
because<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.860> made<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> steel<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.610> right

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
because it's made of a steel all right

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.320 
because it's made of a steel all right
yeah<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.510> kind<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.080> selects<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> heat<00:02:47.330> so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
yeah it kind of in selects the heat so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210 
yeah it kind of in selects the heat so
carefully<00:02:48.780> remove<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.130> gonna

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
carefully remove this I know it's gonna

using<00:03:24.260> accusin<00:03:24.710> art<00:03:25.540> skewer<00:03:27.640> option

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
using accusin art skewer option

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.289 
using accusin art skewer option
see<00:03:30.510> how<00:03:30.570> nice<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.260> shish<00:03:31.620> kebobs<00:03:31.980> turnout

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.660 

here's<00:03:38.299> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
here's the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.920 
here's the
guinness<00:03:40.650> bratwurst

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.050 

so<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> basically<00:03:48.140> cooked<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.769> for<00:03:49.099> about<00:03:49.250> 55

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
so I basically cooked this for about 55

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.899 
so I basically cooked this for about 55
minutes<00:03:50.860> started<00:03:51.860> high<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.430> then<00:03:52.579> changes

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
minutes started high and then changes

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.569 
minutes started high and then changes
her<00:03:53.030> low<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.420> option<00:03:56.870> oh<00:03:56.989> by<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.590> way<00:03:57.739> the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
her low so the option oh by the way the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.520 
her low so the option oh by the way the
reason<00:03:58.730> why<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.000> was<00:03:59.209> making<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.900> noise<00:04:00.049> it's

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
reason why I was making that noise it's

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.250 
reason why I was making that noise it's
partly<00:04:00.860> because<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.760> low<00:04:02.079> distribution<00:04:03.079> of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
partly because the low distribution of

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.309 
partly because the low distribution of
the<00:04:03.409> weight<00:04:04.299> because<00:04:05.299> they<00:04:05.420> kept<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.870> turning

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
the weight because they kept on turning

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.880 
the weight because they kept on turning
back<00:04:06.680> because<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:10.269> lopsided<00:04:11.269> weight

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
back because of the lopsided weight

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.610 
back because of the lopsided weight
distributed<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.099> a<00:04:13.129> skewer<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.769> yeah<00:04:15.980> so

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
distributed on a skewer so yeah so

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.670 
distributed on a skewer so yeah so
that's<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:19.519> Q<00:04:19.699> is<00:04:19.789> an<00:04:19.880> art

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
that's the Q is an art

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.360 
that's the Q is an art
