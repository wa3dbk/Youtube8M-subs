00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.159
 for me it is a primordial thing to find impeccable compartment 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.140
 a carpet that craves appearance nov 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.680
 and the woodwork that shone that breathed that emanate me 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.210
 a smell of cleanliness was also antiques because let's not forget 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.780
 that we are in a museum that is to regroup especially in this 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 wagon there 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.630
 taped in front of them pretty much yes because the panels you see 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.840
 on this vote were made danic 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.660
 but it's still the originals who feel for this earth 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.880
 among the passengers 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.750
 an American 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.410

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.810
 appeared more than ever needed 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.219
 but it's better than nothing 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.009
 the same hope so far beyond that's all I can do is the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.020

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.469

 it has always been a beautiful city and I have a beautiful life today 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.579
 and at the end of the 19th century 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 there were a lot of constructions and league 2 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.169

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.269
 and it's almost forgotten to tell you that it's at the end of the 19th century 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.969
 there was already a metro line 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.209

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.080
 this train is a bit of an old lady 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.970
 sometimes a little 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.800
 capricious 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.590
 bad surprise 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.879

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 so that she always stays for a very nice young lady 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.059

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.979
 perfect way 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.340

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.809
 some cars were heated with charcoal 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.809
