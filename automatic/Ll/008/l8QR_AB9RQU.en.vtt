00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
not even sure if that's exactly how you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.219 
not even sure if that's exactly how you
say<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.060> works<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> being<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.870> card

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
say it but it works up to being one card

say it but it works up to being one card
per<00:01:22.520> tablespoon<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> need<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> really

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
per tablespoon so you need to really

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
per tablespoon so you need to really
double<00:01:25.290> check<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.579> soya<00:01:26.850> sauce<00:01:27.149> is<00:01:27.420> that

cooking<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.700> crock-pot<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.930> decided

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
cooking in the crock-pot so I decided

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.960 
cooking in the crock-pot so I decided
normally<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.579> use<00:03:47.640> rice<00:03:48.450> as<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.810> base<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.790> I've

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
normally you use rice as a base but I've

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.900 
normally you use rice as a base but I've
decided<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.630> rice<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.620> too<00:03:53.130> high<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.519> carbs

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
decided that rice is too high in carbs

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.910 
decided that rice is too high in carbs
so<00:03:54.120> let's<00:03:54.329> use<00:03:54.570> something<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.380> I'm<00:03:55.680> gonna

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
so let's use something out so I'm gonna

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.900 
so let's use something out so I'm gonna
use<00:03:56.660> cauliflower<00:03:57.660> as<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:58.440> rice<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:59.130> this

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.999 
them all up so I've graded my
cauliflower<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.780> this<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.169> basically<00:05:03.440> what

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
cauliflower and this is basically what

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.950 
cauliflower and this is basically what
I've<00:05:04.160> got<00:05:04.370> it's<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.729> little<00:05:05.000> finer<00:05:05.330> than<00:05:05.630> rice

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
I've got it's a little finer than rice

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.249 
I've got it's a little finer than rice
but<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.039> gonna<00:05:07.250> do<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.550> trick<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.840> I'm<00:05:09.080> just

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
but it's gonna do the trick so I'm just

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.800 
but it's gonna do the trick so I'm just
gonna<00:05:09.380> put<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.370> cover<00:05:10.669> on<00:05:10.789> it<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.240> just<00:05:11.449> put<00:05:11.690> him

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
gonna put a cover on it and just put him

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.260 
gonna put a cover on it and just put him
in<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:11.990> fridge<00:05:12.259> for<00:05:12.289> now<00:05:12.680> until<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.639> am<00:05:13.940> ready

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
in the fridge for now until I am ready

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.140 
in the fridge for now until I am ready
for<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.949> pork<00:05:16.250> itself<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.490> here<00:05:19.789> is<00:05:19.970> my

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
for the the pork itself so here is my

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.760 
for the the pork itself so here is my
low<00:05:20.419> carb<00:05:20.750> Korean<00:05:21.289> barbecue<00:05:21.889> pork<00:05:23.199> what<00:05:24.199> I<00:05:24.229> did

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
low carb Korean barbecue pork what I did

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.760 
low carb Korean barbecue pork what I did
was<00:05:25.039> when<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.550> shredded<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:27.229> cauliflower

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
was when I shredded the the cauliflower

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.589 
was when I shredded the the cauliflower
I<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.430> put<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.669> in<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.820> microwave<00:05:29.120> just<00:05:29.389> to

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
I just put it in the microwave just to

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.330 
I just put it in the microwave just to
warm<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.080> up<00:05:30.139> a<00:05:30.320> bit<00:05:30.349> I<00:05:30.500> didn't<00:05:30.860> really<00:05:31.070> want<00:05:31.280> to

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
warm it up a bit I didn't really want to

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.149 
warm it up a bit I didn't really want to
cook<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.760> because<00:05:32.510> it's<00:05:32.690> finely<00:05:33.139> shredded<00:05:33.530> it

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
cook it because it's finely shredded it

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.990 
cook it because it's finely shredded it
it's<00:05:34.849> not<00:05:35.169> really<00:05:36.169> crunchy<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.490> cooked<00:05:37.760> it<00:05:37.880> I

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
it's not really crunchy if I cooked it I

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.230 
it's not really crunchy if I cooked it I
felt<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.510> would<00:05:38.599> have<00:05:38.720> been<00:05:38.840> too<00:05:39.050> soggy<00:05:39.349> so

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
felt it would have been too soggy so

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.180 
felt it would have been too soggy so
here's<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.479> combination<00:05:41.800> might<00:05:42.800> pretend

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
here's the combination might pretend

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.040 
here's the combination might pretend
rice<00:05:43.520> which<00:05:43.760> is<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:44.030> cauliflower<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:44.900> then

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
rice which is the cauliflower and then

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.149 
rice which is the cauliflower and then
my<00:05:45.349> my<00:05:45.860> pork<00:05:46.250> Korean<00:05:46.760> pork<00:05:47.060> now<00:05:47.690> you<00:05:48.409> I<00:05:48.740> found

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
my my pork Korean pork now you I found

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.920 
my my pork Korean pork now you I found
when<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.610> made<00:05:49.909> it<00:05:50.060> I<00:05:50.150> think<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.509> cooked<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:50.870> a

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
when I made it I think I cooked it a

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.779 
when I made it I think I cooked it a
little<00:05:50.960> too<00:05:51.320> long<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:52.039> got<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.220> little<00:05:52.370> dry

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
little too long so it got a little dry

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.810 
little too long so it got a little dry
you<00:05:53.300> could<00:05:53.509> double<00:05:53.900> up<00:05:53.990> on<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.820> liquid

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
you could double up on the liquid

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.969 
you could double up on the liquid
ingredients<00:05:56.690> if<00:05:56.840> you<00:05:57.409> would<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:57.889> you

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
ingredients if you would like so you

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.890 
ingredients if you would like so you
have<00:05:58.009> some<00:05:58.340> more<00:05:58.490> sauce<00:05:58.759> that<00:05:59.000> can<00:05:59.150> pour<00:05:59.570> over

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
have some more sauce that can pour over

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.930 
have some more sauce that can pour over
top<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.320> cauliflower<00:06:00.680> but<00:06:01.610> it<00:06:01.699> still

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
top of the cauliflower but it still

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.840 
top of the cauliflower but it still
tastes<00:06:02.389> really<00:06:02.539> good
