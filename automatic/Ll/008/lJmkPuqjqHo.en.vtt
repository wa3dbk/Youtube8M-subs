00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.170
 she has friends it's poppy I hope 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.880
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.440
 going great Thursday we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 new video a little bit informative 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.170
 compared to holidays so I hope 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.279
 first of all that you go from very 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 good holiday anyway it's not 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.720
 finished and still happy so suddenly 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 that's it for those who follow me on 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 twitter already know what I'm going 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 speak but there are inevitably 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.810
 people who do not follow me on 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 twitter because not everyone has 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.990
 tweeted hours this sentence did not want 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.520
 to say nothing finally good it's okay 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 so I just wanted 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.079
 you talk about video rhythm videos 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 who will change 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.590
 not already as you saw there was 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 four videos a week with respect 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.620
 those late dragan a week it lasted 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.480
 a week and a few days but good 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 it does not matter there were four videos 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.300
 in the week and actually if you 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.219
 want the 19th on the 19th of July we had to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.280
 turn another series but she was 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.989
 postponed so the blow bah actually if 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.180
 you want I had planned to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 clauds him of the block of video a week 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.080
 during the month of August but as she has 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.220
 been postponed we do not have the series and ben 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 I did not foresee the cost of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.530
 return videos so that's okay 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.240
 did I make that a video by 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 week so for three weeks because 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 I speak three weeks on vacation 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.939
 and yes I need it so here it is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 it's going to be just one video per 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.820
 week I 'm not going to much choice 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 it's the base it was planned that is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 three videos a week but being 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.850
 given that there is more to get 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.000
 all the time to get back from you 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 return if these videos what of the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 in addition I do not really want you 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.579
 to do so video a week simply 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 because often it's gay games and 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.570
 game do not know I need to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 very often start again so wise by 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.759
 a little patient I often 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.009
 repeat if level words I'm sorry 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.049
 finally good here and so low shot 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.070
 since I need to 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.869
 take a vacation and it's not in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 making six videos all at once 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.890
 the programs and that it goes even more 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.299
 gets drunk and I want to say because 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.159
 that at this moment the pc it drunk me a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.960
 little bit do not you make these seven 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.750
 passages after I will resume from the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.509
 seed and just like I'm going to do three 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 weeks without pc finally good here and so 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.379
 So I thought, I'm going to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.730
 do only one video a week and then 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.020
 it's not worse because anyway 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.560
 there are already half of the people who 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.940
 are already 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.230
 vacation so that's it and then I think that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.150
 that's about all I wanted 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.410
 just tell you that so what you 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.849
 have to remember it's simply that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 you sneak a video a week of the coup 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.700
 but as there was respect to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.920
 other organs I think it makes a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.750
 good average so that's it's not it's 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.860
 not important 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.880
 I hope you will understand but 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.560
 normally there is not too much 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.220
 difficulty understanding that because 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.989
 I need to take a vacation 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.980
 as well 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.420
 end of the holidays it's not even my 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.620
 job but finally you understand what 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.019
 I mean I did two to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.370
 three videos a week you even beat 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.170
 when I was in class and where at 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.430
 after a while you still need to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.730
 even though I take a small 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 So break here bah suddenly I hope 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.840
 that this video will have brought you 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.670
 answer titles is yes all not without 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.799
 laugh now bah of the blow if you 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.790
 see in the coming months that there is 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.590
 far fewer videos is 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.209
 totally normal I had you when 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.680
 even follow on twitter like that you 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.610
 will have more information to impose 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.620
 questions etc 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.650
 and then not on that I think we'll get 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.390
 leave it there I finished my 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 explanation must I stop moving 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.630
 on my chair there like that because of 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.750
 I blow away the microphone you 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.280
 hear me well and where are you? 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 if not just for the gameplay I was on 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.930
 the kit kit p.com and then that's it for 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.380
 have a small ppp background to be able to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.910
 down you talk to you at the same time 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.380
 that you have a good gameplay tool to 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.930
 look good it's not very good gameplay 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.540
 but here you have something under the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470
 eyes we go suddenly I finished so I 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.910
 wish you all very good 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.049
 vacation and video that will follow will be 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.700
 all program videos and so 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.109
 it's normal if the gameplay dates a 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.940
 little bit of a few weeks but 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.829
 it's not very important so I think 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.299
 so I make you kisses and 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.970
 I wish you a very good holiday 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.069
 enjoy well and then liban I tell you 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.639
 in the fall then go hi friends 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.639
 it was complicated 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.940
 bahia 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.440
 no
