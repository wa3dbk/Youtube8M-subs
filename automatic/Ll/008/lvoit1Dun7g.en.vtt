00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.720 

now<00:01:30.440> let's<00:01:30.650> talk<00:01:30.800> about<00:01:30.860> some<00:01:31.280> things<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
now let's talk about some things that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.700 
now let's talk about some things that
could<00:01:31.940> go<00:01:32.120> wrong<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.230> fix<00:01:33.500> them

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
could go wrong and how you can fix them

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.530 
could go wrong and how you can fix them
so<00:01:34.370> if<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.580> find<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.120> ball<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.330> going

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
so if you find that the ball is going

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.170 
so if you find that the ball is going
behind<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.440> or<00:01:37.040> going<00:01:37.220> away<00:01:37.430> from<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.970> that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
behind you or going away from you that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.120 
behind you or going away from you that
means<00:01:38.570> your<00:01:38.690> thigh<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:38.990> not<00:01:39.410> even<00:01:39.860> with<00:01:40.010> your

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
means your thigh is not even with your

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.430 
means your thigh is not even with your
waist<00:01:40.340> if<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:40.850> angled<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:41.660> this<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
waist if it's angled down like this the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.470 
waist if it's angled down like this the
ball<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.800> going<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.160> way<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.760> was<00:01:43.940> angled<00:01:44.330> to

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
ball is going that way it was angled to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.570 
ball is going that way it was angled to
up<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:44.840> it's<00:01:45.440> going<00:01:45.740> behind<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
up on it's going behind you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.630 
up on it's going behind you
so<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.300> even<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.230> weights<00:01:48.440> now<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:49.520> if

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
so I even with the weights now what if

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120 
so I even with the weights now what if
you<00:01:49.760> can<00:01:49.880> only<00:01:49.970> get<00:01:50.180> one<00:01:50.390> or<00:01:50.540> two<00:01:50.570> thoughts

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
you can only get one or two thoughts

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.980 
you can only get one or two thoughts
let's<00:01:52.130> make<00:01:52.370> sure<00:01:52.400> if<00:01:53.030> that's<00:01:53.240> happening<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
let's make sure if that's happening that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.870 
let's make sure if that's happening that
you're<00:01:54.170> your<00:01:54.500> touch<00:01:54.770> off<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.130> thigh<00:01:55.340> is

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
you're your touch off the thigh is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.700 
you're your touch off the thigh is
getting<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.390> ball<00:01:56.600> up<00:01:56.630> high<00:01:57.020> enough<00:01:57.230> if<00:01:57.470> it's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
getting the ball up high enough if it's

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.350 
getting the ball up high enough if it's
only<00:01:57.980> getting<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.400> a<00:01:58.520> little<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.910> it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
only getting it up a little bit it's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360 
only getting it up a little bit it's
hard<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.660> get<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.900> next<00:02:00.110> tie<00:02:00.290> up<00:02:00.470> in<00:02:00.620> time<00:02:00.830> so

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
hard to get the next tie up in time so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.830 
hard to get the next tie up in time so
get<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> good<00:02:01.760> tux<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.300> gives<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:02.600> enough

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
get a good tux that gives you enough
