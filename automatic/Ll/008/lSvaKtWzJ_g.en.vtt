00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.449 
on the other hand it might be kind of
cool<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:32.750> there<00:03:32.990> was<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.350> bribery<00:03:33.800> aspect

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
cool if there was like a bribery aspect

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.040 
cool if there was like a bribery aspect
to<00:03:34.580> Age<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.820> Empires<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.570> they<00:03:35.690> work<00:03:35.870> that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
to Age of Empires and if they work that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.900 
to Age of Empires and if they work that
into<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> game<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:36.950> anyway<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.730> right

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
into the game but anyway as it is right

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.040 
into the game but anyway as it is right
now<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.630> annoying

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
now it's just annoying

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.680 
now it's just annoying
now<00:03:39.860> number<00:03:40.100> eight<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.610> can<00:03:40.790> argue<00:03:41.000> it's<00:03:41.480> just

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
now number eight you can argue it's just

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.750 
now number eight you can argue it's just
part<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.989> being<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.350> good<00:03:42.500> player<00:03:42.800> but<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.400> find

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
part of being a good player but I find

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.130 
part of being a good player but I find
it<00:03:43.850> super<00:03:44.030> annoying<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:44.840> when<00:03:45.019> your

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
it super annoying and that's when your

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.840 
it super annoying and that's when your
infantry<00:03:45.560> gets<00:03:45.800> killed<00:03:46.070> by<00:03:46.310> hit-and-run

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850

of<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.269> tough<00:04:05.480> spot<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.780> don't<00:04:06.200> like<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> looks

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
of a tough spot I don't like the looks

of a tough spot I don't like the looks
of<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.519> number<00:04:07.760> six<00:04:08.000> feels<00:04:08.239> like<00:04:08.420> one<00:04:08.570> of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
of the number six feels like one of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.870 
of the number six feels like one of
those<00:04:08.780> cosmic<00:04:09.220> paradoxes<00:04:10.220> where<00:04:10.580> you<00:04:10.670> don't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
those cosmic paradoxes where you don't

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.910 
those cosmic paradoxes where you don't
have<00:04:11.060> any<00:04:11.269> gold<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> decide<00:04:12.320> that<00:04:12.769> you're

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
have any gold so you decide that you're

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.440 
have any gold so you decide that you're
gonna<00:04:13.040> trade<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.580> get<00:04:13.730> some<00:04:14.000> gold

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
gonna trade to get some gold

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.020 
gonna trade to get some gold
but<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.780> need<00:04:15.019> gold<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.620> start<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.100> trade<00:04:16.459> so

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
but you need gold to start that trade so

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.180 
but you need gold to start that trade so
you<00:04:17.120> need<00:04:17.299> gold<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.780> get<00:04:17.959> gold<00:04:18.290> that's<00:04:18.859> kind<00:04:19.160> of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
you need gold to get gold that's kind of

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.640 
you need gold to get gold that's kind of
knowing<00:04:19.370> when<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.640> don't<00:04:19.790> have<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.150> Oh<00:04:20.650> still

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
knowing when you don't have it Oh still

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.800 
knowing when you don't have it Oh still
it's<00:04:22.040> not<00:04:22.190> quite<00:04:22.580> ragequit<00:04:23.210> worthy<00:04:23.600> and

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
it's not quite ragequit worthy and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.880 
it's not quite ragequit worthy and
that's<00:04:24.080> what<00:04:24.260> we're<00:04:24.350> going<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.560> talk<00:04:24.740> about
