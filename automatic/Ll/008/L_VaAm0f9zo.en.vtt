little<00:03:08.959> knob<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:11.580> see<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:13.800> went<00:03:14.070> like

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
little knob here and see that went like

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.870 
little knob here and see that went like
super<00:03:14.790> high<00:03:14.970> look<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.600> all<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.280> way<00:03:17.430> up

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
super high look like all the way up

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.750 
super high look like all the way up
there<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:18.870> came<00:03:19.020> back<00:03:19.170> down<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.580> yeah

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
there and then came back down so yeah

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.020 
there and then came back down so yeah
this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.240> what<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.690> looks<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:23.030> pretty

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this is what it looks like pretty

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.610 
this is what it looks like pretty
powerful<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.810> mean<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.290> could<00:03:25.410> break

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
powerful I mean like it could break

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.290 
powerful I mean like it could break
something<00:03:25.920> if<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.250> shot<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.610> sometimes<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.150> yeah

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
something if I shot it sometimes so yeah

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.500 
something if I shot it sometimes so yeah
it's<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.570> powerful<00:03:28.370> um<00:03:30.920> okay<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.700> it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's really powerful um okay in here it

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.979 
it's really powerful um okay in here it
used<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.080> have<00:03:34.320> like<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.830> rocket<00:03:35.660> things<00:03:36.660> like

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
used to have like a rocket things like

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.900 
used to have like a rocket things like
two<00:03:37.290> little<00:03:37.560> rockets<00:03:38.040> they<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.430> shoot<00:03:38.760> out

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
two little rockets they can shoot out

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.900 
two little rockets they can shoot out
but<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.870> modified<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.790> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
but I modified that and I just have it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.210 
but I modified that and I just have it
as<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> storage<00:03:42.420> thing<00:03:42.959> his<00:03:43.620> dad<00:03:43.860> was<00:03:43.950> kept

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
as a storage thing his dad was kept

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.259 
as a storage thing his dad was kept
breaking<00:03:44.670> off<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:46.760> decided<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> make<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
breaking off so I decided to make it a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.170 
breaking off so I decided to make it a
storage<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.680> could<00:03:49.950> pretend<00:03:50.940> like

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
storage and like I could pretend like

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.280 
storage and like I could pretend like
smuggle<00:03:51.630> stuff<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.080> stuff<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.750> then<00:03:54.750> here

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
smuggle stuff and stuff so and then here

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.080 
smuggle stuff and stuff so and then here
i<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.500> made<00:03:55.890> into<00:03:56.130> another<00:03:56.370> space<00:03:56.610> for

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
i just made into another space for

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.350 
i just made into another space for
storage<00:03:57.480> now<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.440> had<00:03:58.680> was<00:03:58.890> actually<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.910> was<00:04:00.090> to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
storage now I had was actually it was to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.660 
storage now I had was actually it was to
storage<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:01.680> had<00:04:01.830> little<00:04:01.860> things<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.430> put<00:04:02.519> his

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
storage but had little things to put his

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.050 
storage but had little things to put his
guns<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.510> i<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.720> took<00:04:03.780> those<00:04:04.019> up<00:04:05.570> okay<00:04:06.570> um

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
guns on so i just took those up okay um

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.900 
guns on so i just took those up okay um
then<00:04:09.060> here<00:04:11.959> when<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.739> put<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.040> Han<00:04:14.489> Solo

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
then here when you can put that Han Solo

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.020 
then here when you can put that Han Solo
thing<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.380> can<00:04:16.560> slide<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.250> here<00:04:17.790> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
thing then you can slide it in here and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
then you use this little thing here to

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.120 
then you use this little thing here to
push<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:22.080> then<00:04:22.470> he<00:04:22.590> stays<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:23.010> there

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
push it up and then he stays in there

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.980 
push it up and then he stays in there
doesn't<00:04:23.490> fall<00:04:23.700> out<00:04:23.729> when<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.300> go<00:04:24.450> like<00:04:24.690> up

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
doesn't fall out when you go like up

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.570 
doesn't fall out when you go like up
like<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:27.270> then<00:04:27.479> that's<00:04:28.050> pretty<00:04:28.320> cool<00:04:28.590> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
like that so then that's pretty cool you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
like that so then that's pretty cool you
can<00:04:29.760> just<00:04:29.910> also<00:04:30.240> use<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.990> movies<00:04:31.410> as

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
can just also use it in like movies as

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.930 
can just also use it in like movies as
the<00:04:31.919> ramp<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.669> like<00:04:32.849> put<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.120> up

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
the ramp just like put it up

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.840 
the ramp just like put it up
and<00:04:34.720> there's<00:04:34.960> little<00:04:35.170> area<00:04:35.500> down<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:35.850> and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
and there's little area down here and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.360 
and there's little area down here and
you<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.180> put<00:04:37.450> bombs<00:04:37.810> in<00:04:38.290> there<00:04:38.530> these<00:04:39.130> took<00:04:39.340> a

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
you can put bombs in there these took a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.880 
you can put bombs in there these took a
little<00:04:39.550> bomb<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.630> then<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:43.450> lift<00:04:44.230> this<00:04:44.620> up

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
little bomb and then you lift this up

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.070 
little bomb and then you lift this up
that's<00:04:45.790> going<00:04:47.070> like<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.810> see<00:04:49.810> there's<00:04:50.020> a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
that's going like that and see there's a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.500 
that's going like that and see there's a
hole<00:04:50.320> that's<00:04:50.500> where<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.800> bombs<00:04:51.040> were<00:04:51.280> I'm<00:04:52.270> not

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
hole that's where the bombs were I'm not

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.970 
hole that's where the bombs were I'm not
thing<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:53.050> then<00:04:53.140> when<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.320> turn<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.680> they

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
thing but then when you turn it they

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.210 
thing but then when you turn it they
fall<00:04:54.250> out<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.870> can<00:04:55.990> bomb<00:04:56.380> people<00:04:56.740> like<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
fall out so I can bomb people like I

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.510 
fall out so I can bomb people like I
think<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.610> might<00:04:57.730> be<00:04:58.320> um<00:04:59.340> they're<00:05:00.340> like

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
think that might be um they're like

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.930 
think that might be um they're like
cosmic<00:05:01.300> charges<00:05:02.340> see<00:05:03.340> here's<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.640> picture

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
cosmic charges see here's a picture

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.500 
cosmic charges see here's a picture
little<00:05:04.840> fit<00:05:05.280> putting<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:06.520> those<00:05:07.000> little

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
little fit putting in those little

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.240 
little fit putting in those little
things<00:05:07.630> I<00:05:09.300> don't<00:05:10.300> know<00:05:10.990> why<00:05:11.170> that<00:05:11.200> pictures<00:05:11.770> of

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
things I don't know why that pictures of

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.480 
things I don't know why that pictures of
bubbles<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:13.000> with<00:05:13.290> like<00:05:14.290> arm<00:05:14.620> details<00:05:15.130> but

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
bubbles that with like arm details but

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.030 
bubbles that with like arm details but
that's<00:05:15.670> not<00:05:15.820> he<00:05:15.940> didn't<00:05:16.150> come<00:05:16.330> with<00:05:16.480> this<00:05:16.630> and

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
that's not he didn't come with this and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.590 
that's not he didn't come with this and
then<00:05:18.040> there's<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.460> bond<00:05:18.790> like<00:05:19.060> two<00:05:19.330> little

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
then there's a bond like two little

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.740 
then there's a bond like two little
white<00:05:19.780> heads<00:05:20.140> that<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:20.560> put<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:20.920> there<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:25.140> um

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
white heads that you put in there so um

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.340 
white heads that you put in there so um
you<00:05:28.750> get<00:05:28.900> these<00:05:29.050> really<00:05:29.200> cool<00:05:29.700> um<00:05:31.920> laser<00:05:32.920> and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
you get these really cool um laser and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.320 
you get these really cool um laser and
they're<00:05:35.350> pretty<00:05:35.530> cool<00:05:35.830> they<00:05:36.460> look<00:05:36.730> good<00:05:36.970> and

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
they're pretty cool they look good and
