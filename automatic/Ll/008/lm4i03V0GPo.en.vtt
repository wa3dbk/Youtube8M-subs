Wheat flour - 2 cup

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:39.212

Cashew nuts - 8-10

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.392
Green cardamom - 4-5 (peel and make powder)

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.017
Roast the flour for making ladoo.

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:09.064
Preheat pan and add ghee into it.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.119
Keep some amount of ghee for adding later.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:28.657
When ghee melts add flour and sauté on medium flame until it turns little brown and smells good.

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:48.736
Flour is roasted now; turn off the gas.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.087
Keep stirring the flour in pan.

00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:03.852
Let the flour get frigid, then add tagar and make ladoos.

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:24.688
Take out roasted flour in a big utensil; add cashew nuts and cardamom powder into it.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.783
Mix well.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.829
Don’t make the flour too frigid as it will become difficult in binding the ladoos.

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:44.642
Now add tagar in the flour.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:56.249

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:14.905

Take little amount of mixture in your hands; roll it giving a round shape.

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.202
We are making medium size ladoo.

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:50.827
Make round ladoos like this and place in plate.

00:03:56.648 --> 00:04:01.140
