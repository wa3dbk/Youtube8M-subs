basically there they are

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
basically there they are
there's<00:00:49.589> adapter<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.629> left<00:00:51.989> side

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

there's adapter so on the left side
you've<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.499> the<00:00:52.679> SATA<00:00:53.190> cable<00:00:54.289> this<00:00:55.289> hard

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
you've got the SATA cable this hard

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.069 
you've got the SATA cable this hard
drive<00:00:55.859> does<00:00:56.039> support<00:00:56.370> set<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> free<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.929> get

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
drive does support set a free so you get

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.290 
drive does support set a free so you get
a<00:00:58.109> high<00:00:58.469> speeds<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.120> there<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.569> power

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
a high speeds and there is the power

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
a high speeds and there is the power
that's<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.449> cable<00:01:03.899> adaptor<00:01:04.729> there<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> don't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that's all cable adaptor there I don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.039 
that's all cable adaptor there I don't
know<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.540> ease<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.799> says<00:01:08.060> Foxconn<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.329> but

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
know what ease it says Foxconn on it but

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
know what ease it says Foxconn on it but
whatever<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.469> does<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.520> won't<00:01:11.700> be

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
whatever it does I don't know I won't be

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410 
whatever it does I don't know I won't be
touching<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.759> can<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.030> didn't

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
touching it as you can see I didn't

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
touching it as you can see I didn't
place<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> anti-static<00:01:17.159> bag<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> came

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
place it on the anti-static bag it came

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
place it on the anti-static bag it came
in<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.500> reason<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
in because the reason for that is that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
in because the reason for that is that
outside<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.909> bags<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.420> static<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:23.189> isn't

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
outside the bags are static what isn't

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
outside the bags are static what isn't
so<00:01:24.020> occasionally<00:01:25.020> even<00:01:25.590> though<00:01:25.649> it's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so occasionally even though it's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.139 
so occasionally even though it's
probably<00:01:25.890> real<00:01:26.250> wood<00:01:26.630> from<00:01:27.630> Ikea<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> there's

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
probably real wood from Ikea so there's

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.359 
probably real wood from Ikea so there's
there's<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.750> hard<00:01:30.899> drive<00:01:31.109> I'm<00:01:31.740> making<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.100> build

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
there's my hard drive I'm making a build

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.910 
suppose it's a good thing because when
the<00:02:05.939> hard<00:02:06.659> drive<00:02:06.840> does<00:02:07.020> vibrate<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.770> will

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the hard drive does vibrate it will

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.899 
the hard drive does vibrate it will
absorb<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.580> lot<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.769> as<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.489> here

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
absorb a lot more of it as you see here

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.580 
absorb a lot more of it as you see here
these<00:02:12.540> little<00:02:12.750> things

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
these little things

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
these little things
picking<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.220> where<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> hard<00:02:15.090> drive

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
picking out that is where the hard drive

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.259 
picking out that is where the hard drive
lies<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:16.379> actually<00:02:16.830> touching<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
lies so it's not actually touching the

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.940 
lies so it's not actually touching the
back<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.690> case<00:02:18.900> which<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.379> quite<00:02:19.590> nice<00:02:19.739> as

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
back of the case which is quite nice as

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.380 
back of the case which is quite nice as
well<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.340> doesn't<00:02:20.580> vibrate<00:02:21.540> either<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:24.239> do

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
well so it doesn't vibrate either you do

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.119 
well so it doesn't vibrate either you do
have<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.690> screw<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.230> brackets<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.860> through

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
have to screw these brackets on through

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.500 
have to screw these brackets on through
the<00:02:26.280> hard<00:02:26.459> drive<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the hard drive so I'm just going to

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
the hard drive so I'm just going to
screw<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> screw<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.590> babe<00:02:28.830> I've

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
screw a screw on one so babe I've

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.699 
screw a screw on one so babe I've
screwed<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.879> all<00:02:30.269> four<00:02:30.660> screws<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
screwed on all four screws so the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.630 
screwed on all four screws so the
bracket<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.310> now<00:02:33.000> connected<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.250> all<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> have

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
bracket is now connected and all I have

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.190 
bracket is now connected and all I have
to<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.440> screw<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.580> back<00:02:38.580> into<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.480> case<00:02:39.629> so

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
to do is screw it back into the case so

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.050 
to do is screw it back into the case so
that<00:02:42.080> should<00:02:43.080> hold<00:02:43.470> there<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:45.330> yep<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that should hold there and yep as you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.030 
that should hold there and yep as you
see<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.480> connectors<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> bottom<00:02:49.829> you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
see the connectors at the bottom you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.559 
see the connectors at the bottom you
want<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.280> make<00:02:50.489> sure<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> bond<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.239> if

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
want to make sure a bond because if

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.449 
want to make sure a bond because if
there<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.750> at<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.049> top<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:53.010> won't<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.250> able<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
there is at the top you won't be able to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.850 
there is at the top you won't be able to
access<00:02:53.640> em<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.269> these<00:02:54.810> brackets<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.440> only

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
access em this these brackets do only

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.220 
access em this these brackets do only
let<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:58.230> orientation<00:02:59.000> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
let you have it in this orientation so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.539 
let you have it in this orientation so
yeah<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.410> take<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:01.799> mind<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.370> you're

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
yeah just take that in mind if you're

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.150 
yeah just take that in mind if you're
using<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:03.120> different<00:03:03.360> case<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.410> it's<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.099> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
using a different case so it's going to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.869 
using a different case so it's going to
screw<00:03:05.340> four<00:03:05.700> screws<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.950> bear<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.010> me<00:03:08.129> all

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
screw four screws in so bear with me all

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.360 
screw four screws in so bear with me all
four<00:03:09.569> screws<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.260> screwed<00:03:10.680> in<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.040> I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
four screws are now screwed in and I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190 
four screws are now screwed in and I
would<00:03:11.640> advise<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.629> magnetic

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
would advise you to get a magnetic

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.720 
would advise you to get a magnetic
screwdriver<00:03:13.440> because<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.730> hard<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
screwdriver because that was hard the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.400 
screwdriver because that was hard the
reason<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.060> haven't<00:03:18.239> put<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.840> hot<00:03:19.170> swap

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
reason I haven't put it in the hot swap

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.990 
reason I haven't put it in the hot swap
Bay<00:03:20.600> which<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.630> here<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
Bay which is here is because this I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.170 
Bay which is here is because this I
won't<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.079> need<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.319> take<00:03:25.440> anywhere<00:03:26.180> I'm

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
won't really need to take anywhere I'm

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.229 
won't really need to take anywhere I'm
going<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:27.450> keep<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.829> empty<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.030> case

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
going to keep that empty just in case

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.990 
going to keep that empty just in case
one<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.319> my<00:03:31.410> friends<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:32.099> someone<00:03:32.549> wants<00:03:32.940> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
one of my friends or someone wants to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.819 
one of my friends or someone wants to
bring<00:03:33.180> around<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.480> hard<00:03:33.630> drive<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.079> quickly

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
bring around the hard drive and quickly

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.740 
bring around the hard drive and quickly
use<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:35.280> can<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.459> shove<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.630> there

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
use it they can just shove it in there

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.470 
use it they can just shove it in there
rather<00:03:36.959> than<00:03:37.170> open<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> case<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.299> was

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
rather than open up the case so this was

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.110 
rather than open up the case so this was
an<00:03:39.569> installation<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.560> once<00:03:41.549> again<00:03:41.760> thanks

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
an installation and once again thanks

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.450 
an installation and once again thanks
for<00:03:42.150> watching
