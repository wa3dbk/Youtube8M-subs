technology<00:06:27.740> that<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:28.310> multiplayer<00:06:28.790> guys<00:06:29.000> can

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
technology that the multiplayer guys can

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.330 
technology that the multiplayer guys can
take<00:06:29.300> advantage<00:06:29.479> of<00:06:29.990> and<00:06:30.229> that<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.860> balance

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
take advantage of and that the balance

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.070 
take advantage of and that the balance
and<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.580> carrier<00:06:31.850> that<00:06:31.970> goes<00:06:32.120> into<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.479> it's

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
and the carrier that goes into that it's

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.510 
and the carrier that goes into that it's
different<00:06:33.320> when<00:06:33.560> you're<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:34.070> know<00:06:34.190> when
