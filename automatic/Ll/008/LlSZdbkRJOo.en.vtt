00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.360
 it has not been for me the best of your 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.469
 interpretations in this competition and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.780
 there has also been a theme of 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.780
 tuning at a critical moment 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.180
 retirement tomorrow I 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.180
 thanks just is inoperative 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.390
 sentence for vanity but in reality 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.100
 sentence I do not think I deserved 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.750
 for contest has its cantes de 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.070
 marisol was right but I did not say anything 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.360
 It's fine, I'm nice, you have to give 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 we practice the track because it does not have 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 nothing, I 'm already stressed 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.720
 to be able to realize 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.200
 but not 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.540
 but not 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:14.050
 I believe that he withdraws from the competition 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.050
 I will not continue 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.720
 this is a farce what happens when 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.450
 I believe that always 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 Obviously the sentence brings out the best 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.350
 of some and not so much in the best of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.090
 others 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.659
 obviously pains is not in these 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.580
 moments on the set of I am we do not know 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 What will happen to Carlos Moran as 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.200
 general producer as well as jury 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.740
 we would like to hear your opinion about what 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.270
 happened here and here are several things in 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.460
 First of all I have to say that this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.789
 I feel very sorry when we 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 we do this program we do not 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.630
 because we want to bring people here to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.220
 is unfair to them or to tell them 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 things not going to help us grow 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.540
 when we have this program what 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.790
 we do because we believe that we have to give it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.860
 a space for talent to talent for everything 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.440
 the country and we have brought artists from all 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.569
 the country and we want to show them because that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 changes their lives as life changed 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.440
 by ramiro saavedra how life changed 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.989
 of ronald hidalgo how he changed the life of 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.120
 annie rodríguez left peels of all 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.739
 them and that someone leaves the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.140
 competition with this feeling 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.730
 first thing I'm not going to bother gives me 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.920
 a huge penalty 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.349
 it is a terrible pity that has happened 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.470
 this with pains who has a huge 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.810
 talent I have to also say that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.549
 these are the rules of the contest I have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.010
 Here I took the trouble to review a 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.080
 little the first season and I have to 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.190
 say the name of artists of the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.860
 first season that was a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.349
 sentence many times that they consider it 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.530
 part of the rafael competition went to 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.510
 Marc Anthony sentence went to sentence 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.180
 amy winehouse an and rodríguez went to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.879
 tito nieves sentence was sentence two 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.019
 times and Juan Gabriel one of the best 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.629
 singers that has stopped at that 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.730
 scenario went to sentencing twice and 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.260
 that helped him with the help of the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.150
 staff of teachers that accompanies me here 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.280
 get extraordinary imitation that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.319
 now all this group of artists 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.120
 has stadiums filled nationwide 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.859
 we want to find the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.480
 best imitators and train them 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.450
 we do not want that talent like that of 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.769
 pains go away 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.700
 wasted and now she is gone today 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.280
 day there have been some conversations 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.659
 telephone calls with them on 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.560
 possibility that it comes at the end has not 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.150
 come this there are legal issues that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.159
 will have to see have the lawyers that 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.579
 they do not concern me and we are interested in what 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.019
 only I say from here I wish that 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.879
 let's have an opportunity to follow 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.250
 listening to sing because you sing very 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.739
 well he is extraordinary and we would have 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.920
 liked being able to help you be the best 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.520
 possible version of you 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.190
 I'm so sorry Joanna Carreño has not 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.290
 presented a last query to don 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.450
 Ricardo that means that only 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.040
 a person is eliminated tonight 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.500
 true not 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.300
 there is already a person who does not appear 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.190
 person who has not shown up so 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.600
 which has broken his contract and is gone 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.830
 but the rules of the contest indicate that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.990
 today there is a two elimination 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.990
 participants for their presentations
