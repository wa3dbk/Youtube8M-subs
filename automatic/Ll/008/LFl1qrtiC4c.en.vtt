 me near the sink 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.179

 headache from sinusitis and some 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 allergic reactions this is exactly 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.629
 that saves so many people so here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.760
 coconut mass for oil plain i 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 I use these sticks in a ditch on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.030
 I advise everyone who goes to America who 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.040
 there are drivers and make them dry 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.890
 linen 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.549
 saves you money and dries faster 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 i put a level and lavender on them i and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.799
 it smells really good after that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.929
 I have the form of the pattern and the hair I sweat 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.069

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.209
 give 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.730

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 any skin sores but also 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.989

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.290

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.720
 antibiotic 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.840
 and plus if there is some kind of cold or 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.379
 some kind of infection instead of antibiotics i 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.510
 take oregano oil one or two drops 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.560

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.529
 about the fact that you cure your teeth 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:52.199
