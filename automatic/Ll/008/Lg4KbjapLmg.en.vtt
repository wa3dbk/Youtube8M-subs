00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and destroying it is to find its

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.420 
and destroying it is to find its

before<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.450> could<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.900> data<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> safety<00:02:31.740> so

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
before I could get the data to safety so

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.370 
before I could get the data to safety so
I<00:02:32.430> hid<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.090> r2<00:02:33.270> unit<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.959> sent<00:02:34.290> him
