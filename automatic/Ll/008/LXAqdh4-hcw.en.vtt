that there is some auditory response

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
that there is some auditory response
unit<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.160> boot<00:00:59.969> scootin<00:01:00.120> move<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:02.960> unit

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
unit one boot scootin move here use unit

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.400 
unit one boot scootin move here use unit
one<00:01:04.140> whose<00:01:05.009> spirits<00:01:05.550> attempts<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:06.540> here

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
one whose spirits attempts with here

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.380 
one whose spirits attempts with here
command<00:01:10.410> them<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.619> destroy<00:01:10.979> units<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.789> can

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
command them to destroy units I can

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
command them to destroy units I can
basically<00:01:13.020> put<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:15.170> hand<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.799> can

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
basically put my hand down and I can

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
basically put my hand down and I can
select<00:01:17.220> units<00:01:17.790> between<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.479> particular<00:01:18.780> region

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
select units between a particular region

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.340 
select units between a particular region
using<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.280> bimanual<00:01:20.880> selection<00:01:21.690> technique

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
using a bimanual selection technique

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.600 
using a bimanual selection technique
this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.040> quite<00:01:23.400> difficult

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this is something that's quite difficult

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
this is something that's quite difficult
to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> mouse<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.580> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to do with just a mouse and I can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
to do with just a mouse and I can
actually<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:27.960> units<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actually take those units and I can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
actually take those units and I can
label<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.580> as<00:01:29.640> particular<00:01:30.210> numbers<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:30.990> i

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
label them as particular numbers so if i

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.310 
label them as particular numbers so if i
say<00:01:31.729> label<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> unit<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.500> unit<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:35.600> move<00:01:36.600> here

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
say label is unit to unit to move here

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.219 
say label is unit to unit to move here
and<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.760> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.330> two<00:01:39.600> units<00:01:39.960> are

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and you can see that the two units are

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
and you can see that the two units are
now<00:01:40.770> relocating<00:01:41.580> next<00:01:42.540> worker<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
now relocating next worker so you can

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
now relocating next worker so you can
see<00:01:44.580> i'm<00:01:44.700> relocating<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.259> where<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
see i'm relocating on to where all the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.420 
see i'm relocating on to where all the
workers<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.580> i<00:01:47.640> build<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> farm<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
workers are and i build a farm here

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.180 
workers are and i build a farm here
word<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.690> then<00:01:51.900> he<00:01:52.050> built<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:52.650> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> go

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
word and then he built he's going to go

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.220 
word and then he built he's going to go
off<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.610> build<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.910> farm<00:01:54.150> build<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.990> barracks

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
off and build a farm build a barracks

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.750 
off and build a farm build a barracks
here<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:01.320> he<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.980> off<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.520> build

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
here so now he is going off to build

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:12.699 
here so now he is going off to build
this<00:02:03.060> barracks<00:02:04.460> unit<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:08.030> attack<00:02:09.320> here<00:02:10.550> no

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
this barracks unit to attack here no

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:28.430 
this barracks unit to attack here no
unit<00:02:13.709> 24<00:02:14.690> attack<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:19.550> unitive<00:02:21.440> attack<00:02:24.050> no
