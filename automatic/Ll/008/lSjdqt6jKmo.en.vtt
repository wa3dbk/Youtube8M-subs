00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
obviously German purity law is a very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.520 
obviously German purity law is a very
real<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
real thing over there and that's how it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
real thing over there and that's how it
should<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> basically<00:00:52.760> he<00:00:53.760> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
should be I think and basically he just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.959 
should be I think and basically he just
got<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> week<00:00:55.199> something<00:00:55.440> ago<00:00:55.969> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
got back like a week something ago and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
got back like a week something ago and
this<00:00:57.180> bottle<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.629> bottled<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.620> days<00:00:58.800> before

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this bottle is bottled two days before

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.619 
this bottle is bottled two days before
he<00:00:59.850> brought<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> home

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
he brought it home

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.100 
he brought it home
so<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> beer<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> week<00:01:02.100> old

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this ancient Bavarian technique of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.070 
this ancient Bavarian technique of
taking<00:01:15.869> rocks<00:01:16.220> superheating<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
taking rocks superheating them and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
taking rocks superheating them and
pouring<00:01:19.080> work<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> tops<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.780 
pouring work over the tops of them and
when<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.330> happens<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.549> malt

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
when that happens the the malt

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
when that happens the the malt
caramelizes<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.650> rocks<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
caramelizes on the rocks and when the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
caramelizes on the rocks and when the
rocks<00:01:27.360> cool<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.990> submerged<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.650> rocks<00:01:28.860> back

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
rocks cool this submerged the rocks back

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
rocks cool this submerged the rocks back
into<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> word<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> like

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
into the word and you get this like

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
into the word and you get this like
smoky<00:01:31.470> burnt<00:01:31.829> caramel<00:01:32.640> II<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> taste

wanted to get a good nose of its order

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.510 
wanted to get a good nose of its order
out<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.440> balloons<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.920> yeah<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.280> sake<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
out of balloons so yeah for the sake of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
out of balloons so yeah for the sake of
being<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.060> everybody<00:02:03.390> else<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:03.720> gonna<00:02:03.810> make

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
being like everybody else I'm gonna make

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.190 
being like everybody else I'm gonna make
one<00:02:04.110> these<00:02:04.230> videos<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.420> first<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.930> would

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
one these videos so first of all I would

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
one these videos so first of all I would
assume<00:02:07.410> this<00:02:07.650> should<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:08.010> drink<00:02:08.340> at<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
assume this should be drink at a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.850 
assume this should be drink at a
relatively<00:02:09.660> warmer<00:02:10.110> temperature<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.680> just

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
relatively warmer temperature that just

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110 
relatively warmer temperature that just
came<00:02:10.980> out<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.220> my<00:02:11.310> fridge<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.880> gonna<00:02:11.970> be

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
came out of my fridge so it's gonna be

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 
came out of my fridge so it's gonna be
way<00:02:12.270> too<00:02:12.330> cold<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.350> think<00:02:13.410> we're<00:02:13.680> probably

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
way too cold so I think we're probably

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.310 
way too cold so I think we're probably
gonna<00:02:14.100> pour<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:14.700> kind<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> let<00:02:15.060> it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
gonna pour it and then kind of let it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.090 
gonna pour it and then kind of let it
hang<00:02:16.320> out<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> snifter<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> bit<00:02:19.100> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
hang out in the snifter for a bit so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:37.190 
hang out in the snifter for a bit so
yeah<00:02:20.250> let's<00:02:20.490> see<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:36.200> should

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
yeah let's see what we got I should

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
yeah let's see what we got I should
totally<00:02:37.610> totally<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.730> culturing<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> e<00:02:39.330> stuff

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the bottom of this bottle I'm thinking

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.310 
the bottom of this bottle I'm thinking
of<00:02:42.210> that<00:02:42.330> right<00:02:42.570> now<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:44.630> okay<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.990> far<00:02:46.020> we

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
of that right now but okay so so far we

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.560 
of that right now but okay so so far we
got<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.470> really<00:02:46.680> dense<00:02:46.980> head<00:02:47.730> looks<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
got a really dense head looks like a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.600 
got a really dense head looks like a
really<00:02:48.780> ruby<00:02:49.230> color<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.980> looks<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> lot<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.490> an

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
really ruby color it looks a lot like an

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.070 
really ruby color it looks a lot like an
oatmeal<00:02:50.730> stack<00:02:51.210> so<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.480> looks<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:51.930> like

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
oatmeal stack so this looks a lot like

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.670 
oatmeal stack so this looks a lot like
the<00:02:52.260> openness<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.740> make<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.700> far<00:02:54.470> I'll<00:02:55.470> see

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the openness that I make so far I'll see

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.390 
the openness that I make so far I'll see
it<00:02:55.740> was<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:55.920> wider<00:02:56.550> mouth<00:02:56.880> does<00:02:58.400> definitely
