00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 before refrigeration ice cream was a 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 luxury handmade ingredients 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 into a bowl within a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.970
 Tacho full of ice and salt water 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 salt helps the ice absorb heat 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750
 cooling the mixture below the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 freeze in the 1920s and the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 Commercial freezers have made production 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 the mass industry and the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:37.670
 ice cream was born to make sweet ice cream 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.670
 first you need to make the ice cream 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 everything starts with fresh cream factory 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 stores the cream in refrigerated silos 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 adjusted only a few degrees above 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.489
 from the freezing point their 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.989
 food mixer a high 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.469
 mixing the cream with 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.469
 other ingredients 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 the main dry ingredients are 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.439
 skimmed milk powder stabilizers and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 herbal modifiers 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.799
 the stabilizers prevent the ice cream 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.990
 is crystallized and the modifiers 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 allow the mixture to connect the air 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 during the abatement process 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.270
 the other ingredients are sugar and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.270
 corn glucose 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.689
 after approximately three minutes 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.549
 the pumping system 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 removes the tank mix from 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.670
 pasteurizing and heat 72 Â° for half an hour 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.600
 killing any bacteria and activating the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 stabilizers then the factory 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.890
 homogenizes a process of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.569
 breaks the fat globules giving the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.569
 ice cream a uniform texture 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.200
 the mixture is cooled and taste 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.840
 Vanilla concentrate is added 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.349
 then the mixture is cooled and beaten 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.719
 a 15 second beat combining blend 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.849
 with air transforming that of a liquid into 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.679
 a solid mori without air 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.179
 the final product would leave with the appearance 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.440
 of frozen milk instead of ice cream 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.119
 Ice cream sandwich withers are 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.980
 made with cake ingredients 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.750
 chocolate filling machine 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.190
 move two lines of oe and did in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.190
 direction of an injection pipe 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.879
 so the two ifs join 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.489
 machine injects a cup 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.950
 vanilla ice cream between them the head 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.359
 the barrel of a form of rectangular bar 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.329
 the ice cream and fits perfectly 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:34.180
 among the lakers 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:38.400
 all this happens at a rate of 140 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.400
 ice cream sandwich per minute 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.360
 as the ice creams pass into the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.860
 The packing industry is still filling the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.870
 frozen due to freezing phase 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.880
 so there is no risk of melting the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.280
 packaging system raises each 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 sandwich to a wrapper after fold 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.540
 and closed the accounts the next machine 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.880
 count the sandwiches and put them in 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.560
 Once sealed boxes 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.510
 the boxes go straight to the freezer of 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 storage at less than 30 degrees 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.190
 in another line the production of busquinhas 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.930
 ice cream is in progress 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.000
 deposits of feed cones 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 already packaged on carriers in a 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 sprayers coat the side of 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.060
 inside with a layer of chocolate that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.100
 adds flavor and creates a barrier 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.470
 between the cone and the ice cream so that the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:51.430
 crust still crispy 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.980
 to eat there then local 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.739
 ice cream filling a production line 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.630
 two tastes a row of cones 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.650
 gets vanilla ice cream the other 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.650
 row chocolate 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.430
 now for a hot surprise at 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.170
 center of the shell an injection of 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.820
 liquid caramel 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.040
 this factory also makes 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.610
 ice cream with chocolate syrup and strawberry 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.610
 inside 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.290
 then a chocolate flavored tail 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.990
 on top of it a crispy finishing touch 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.140
 a layer of covered rice flakes 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.140
 of chocolate 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.520
 Finally, the bushes pass over the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.170
 lids dispenser 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.690
 it applies a coated paper lid 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.310
 in wax on each cone an element 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.650
 instantly melts 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.950
 wax sealing the lid 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.780
 casque paper from here the casquinhas 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.700
 of ice cream go to boxes and then 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.720
 straight into the freezer ready for 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.720
 delight the palates
