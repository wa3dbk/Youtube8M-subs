00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.840
 pippo well in short, what about a debut 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.700
 best you ca n't do it in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.910
 championship 9 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 I'm glad I'm happy because I was a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.720
 little worried about first game especially 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.850
 because I knew that a lot would come 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.860
 in short, people are not the guys 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.720
 used to playing in front of this 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.700
 public instead have made a big one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 the game have tried everything 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.980
 week during training 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.289
 in short, we have set ourselves 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.260
 glad that he made five goals to the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 end of the game they were very happy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.450
 nothing we will grow a party later 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 game 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.880
 we saw you already dropped a hundred for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 one hundred on the bench from the advice you hurry up 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.550
 you do not try to give advice 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.290
 because after three weeks I have not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.020
 the humility to think that you are not yet 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 a coach but we are out of the field 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.309
 I try to give him because I think 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.550
 when you find 16-year-olds he must 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.540
 first of all be an educator 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.790
 because it turned out then comes in second 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.860
 clear plan that pleases if you win 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.390
 especially for them however the fact of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.309
 to be able to teach 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 maybe like how you prepare during 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.999
 the week how to get to the race 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.829
 Sunday also the fact this morning 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.240
 in short, to have taken them to retreat 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.289
 ate all together for them it is 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.359
 a novelty 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.369
 I think it's all things to 16 17 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.020
 years must begin to learn 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.139
 now you have to have this experience alive 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.319
 this for beginning of journey 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.029
 Tomorrow, however, the dream is the goal 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.969
 to get to the bench of the 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:31.439
 milan the real one but look at me 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.389
 honestly right now there 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.920
 I think I think this is growing 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.039
 an extraordinary opportunity because 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.889
 really teach kids soccer 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.959
 of Milan for me a great reason 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:46.850
 proud they are happy that the Milan has 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.159
 chosen me to bring these principles 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.900
 and it's nice to see how they train like 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.090
 they want to learn from me myself 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.670
 I try to give the best of myself then 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.390
 I will try to grow up later 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 game month after month and then the future 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.799
 wonder if I'll be good maybe a 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.270
 opportunity will be given to me if not me 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.289
 I will amuse those young people that it really is 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.739
 a nice experience 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:13.130
 here is your Milan's chance to win 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.680
 the championship of merry is not 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.239
 I know we have to fight both because 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 no one ever leaves beaten at the start 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.800
 which I've always been used to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.420
 which we will try to do well as 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.239
 today Milan must try to do well 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.640
 as in bologna because if you are compact 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.470
 a group if it becomes a strong group 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.819
 you can even maybe do what he did 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.290
 the juventus last year that was not 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.209
 favorite match and then won it 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.450
 scudetto but is favored according to you the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.900
 milan or can fight for the first three 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.280
 seats 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.340
 no i think milan can fight 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.470
 together with juve perhaps the juve part a 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 step above all but because of that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.140
 who has shown and for what he has 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.320
 done last year though I think the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.420
 napoli inter la rome milan are 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.610
 behind ready to take every step 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.650
 false of the juve and as I said before 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.360
 I hope that Milan can win it 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 Scudetto 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.810
 like all the fans I am one too 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.730
 of the most talked-about characters of the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.320
 moment is cassano for his passage 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.230
 for what you said that 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.269
 relationship you had with him the excellent excellent 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.859
 for which I wish good luck 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.930
 when exchanging teams there are many 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.060
 reasons I do n't want to get into the heads 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.709
 in short, that if cassano was count of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.840
 go to the inter and I'm happy because 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.400
 a friend of mine wish him well and 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.200
 as I hope to do good to crazy that 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.720
 that another person I know is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.569
 which was missing and how 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.400
 milan was missing if he did 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.860
 will make us those 15 20 goals that he is able to 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.200
 doing less will aspire for the Scudetto 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.560
 by chance yesterday heard yesterday and this morning 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.010
 is felt happy maybe so for 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.420
 exchange some tactical opinions no 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.420
 I heard ancelotti I heard
