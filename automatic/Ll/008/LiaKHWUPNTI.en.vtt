00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.250
 this is a developed product 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:13.390
 purely for windows 8 but purely 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:17.470
 with tube windows and is and allows 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.019
 basically to take a picture 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.230
 mirroring of own pc c in 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.499
 complete then photo video music 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 any type of program files and each 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.060
 kind of installation this was 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.190
 developed together with microsoft itself 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.850
 then the engineers of marco bocci 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.260
 worked every product allows 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.020
 this is a dedicated product 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.620
 substantially just the it managers 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.200
 the manager edp every and what 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.360
 we would like to do in our 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.730
 desired and that every every team manager 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.590
 turned instead of with a PC with everything 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.810
 preloaded to do the installation of 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.670
 own clients with this which is much more 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.690
 simple much easier among others 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 much faster 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.540
 this is the interface for use 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.939
 of the personal cloud dvd or via vdt 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.920
 ugo the steps are really simple yes 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.140
 takes product came out only takes off 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 from the box it connects to a router is 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.130
 a socket 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.850
 from now on you go to a page of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.830
 support 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.540
 called my book page 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.890
 live from this page you can do 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.650
 through the support you go in 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.040
 access support section is created 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.060
 unique 12-digit code that lasts between 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 the other only two hours 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.479
 this 12-digit code can be 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.100
 entered your own tablet iphone 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.789
 so different android android terminal 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.580
 go to android 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.320
 from that moment the two devices start a 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.690
 talk for them to be connected 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.819
 and to create the personal cloud 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.920
 the interesting thing that every device has 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.590
 a unique code of di 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.220
 reference for activation 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.610
 so you want to activate five people 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.610
 hot 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.119
 2 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.189
 android and iphone terminal you must 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.179
 have five codes and in that case yes 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.160
 it can also develop different steps 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.500
 different steps of personal cloud 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.260
 everyone can manage certain 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.269
 access to certain folders 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.590
 once installed vd to go is done 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.769
 talk to your device 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.120
 your home hard drive is seen 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.920
 inside your pc there is one 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 public cloud folder 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.610
 within this folder there are 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 four subfolders for documents 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.930
 music photos and videos 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.569
 the hypothesis on the photos turns on yes 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 Quickly access photos each photo 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.459
 can be managed 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.769
 putting and streaming presentation 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.590
 obviously it depends on the speed and each 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.480
 single photo can be managed send 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.360
 via e-mail managed as a link e 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040
 first printed with other software for 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.080
 example the pro boxing that already in the pre 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.360
 installed in our system then 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.700
 each file can be sent through 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.799
 three boxes latest news in fact 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.019
 last week and that there is also the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.549
 skydrive system of windows 8 is 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.549
 preloaded in our system
