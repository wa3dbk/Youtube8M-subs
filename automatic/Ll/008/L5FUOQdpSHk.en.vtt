because<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.720> first<00:04:43.930> looks<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.380> beautiful<00:04:44.950> and

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
because it first looks so beautiful and

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.070 
because it first looks so beautiful and
peaceful<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:46.030> then<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.540> becomes<00:04:46.900> suddenly

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
peaceful and then it becomes suddenly

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.290 
peaceful and then it becomes suddenly
something<00:04:47.470> more<00:04:47.740> as<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.340> she<00:04:48.520> raises<00:04:48.760> that<00:04:49.090> I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
something more as that she raises that I

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.870 
something more as that she raises that I
think<00:04:49.630> that's<00:04:49.750> very<00:04:49.870> well<00:04:50.440> done<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:51.520> know<00:04:51.640> I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
think that's very well done you know I

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.340 
think that's very well done you know I
was<00:04:51.970> thinking<00:04:52.180> about<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.870> if<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.110> had<00:04:53.260> to

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
was thinking about it and if I had to

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.470 
was thinking about it and if I had to
describe<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:54.460> film<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.970> somebody<00:04:55.240> i<00:04:55.300> would

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
describe this film to somebody i would

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.960 
describe this film to somebody i would
say<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.780> looks<00:04:55.960> like<00:04:56.170> an<00:04:56.410> Asian<00:04:57.310> Hitchcock

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
say it looks like an Asian Hitchcock

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.660 
say it looks like an Asian Hitchcock
film<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.480> think<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:58.990> mixes<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.500> style<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.250> asian

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
film I think it mixes the style of asian

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.650 
film I think it mixes the style of asian
horror<00:05:01.140> with<00:05:02.140> Hitchcock's<00:05:02.790> thriller<00:05:03.790> type

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
horror with Hitchcock's thriller type

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.250 
horror with Hitchcock's thriller type
