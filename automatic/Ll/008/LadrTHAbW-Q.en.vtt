hey guys it's draggle and today we're
going<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.389> look<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> protect<00:00:04.319> yourself

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
going to look at how to protect yourself

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.930 
going to look at how to protect yourself
against<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> Endor<00:00:05.310> moon<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.609> also<00:00:05.730> going

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
against the Endor moon we're also going

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.150 
against the Endor moon we're also going
to<00:00:06.000> go<00:00:06.120> through<00:00:06.420> what<00:00:07.080> blocks<00:00:07.410> they<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
to go through what blocks they can and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.419 
to go through what blocks they can and
cannot<00:00:08.400> pick<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.670> as<00:00:08.970> far<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.480> know<00:00:09.710> now<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
cannot pick up as far as we know now the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.390 
cannot pick up as far as we know now the
easiest<00:00:11.610> way<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:14.190> dig<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
easiest way to do this is just to dig a

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.700 
easiest way to do this is just to dig a
moat<00:00:14.490> around<00:00:14.790> your<00:00:15.089> house<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
moat around your house as we know the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.290 
moat around your house as we know the
Enderman<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.190> damaged<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.670> water<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Enderman are damaged by water so that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
Enderman are damaged by water so that
works<00:00:18.539> quite<00:00:19.020> well<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.920> also<00:00:20.070> fill<00:00:20.340> with

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
works quite well you can also fill with

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.310 
works quite well you can also fill with
lava<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.330> choose<00:00:21.630> that'll<00:00:22.140> kill

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
lava if you so choose that'll kill

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.830 
lava if you so choose that'll kill
everything<00:00:22.880> another<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
everything another way to do it is it to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
everything another way to do it is it to
have<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> fence<00:00:25.500> around<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.920> house<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> this

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have a fence around your house and this

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.820 
have a fence around your house and this
is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> new<00:00:27.660> creative<00:00:28.109> mode<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.470> very

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
is the new creative mode which is very

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
is the new creative mode which is very
very<00:00:28.859> cool<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.900> literally<00:00:31.140> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
very cool so you can literally just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.920 
very cool so you can literally just
build<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> fence<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:32.070> around<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.430> house<00:00:32.930> just

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
build a fence all around your house just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
build a fence all around your house just
like<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.500> cannot<00:00:34.770> move

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
like that because they cannot move

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.319 
like that because they cannot move
fences<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> fence<00:00:36.630> gate<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> door<00:00:38.329> very

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
fences have a fence gate or a door very

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
fences have a fence gate or a door very
easy<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.620> prefer<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.129> moat<00:00:41.309> method<00:00:41.730> because

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
easy I do prefer the moat method because

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.190 
easy I do prefer the moat method because
it's<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.180> easier<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.570> build<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it's a lot easier to build it like that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's a lot easier to build it like that
and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> fence<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.539> front<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and then just have a fence in front of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
and then just have a fence in front of
the<00:00:46.079> blocks<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> cross<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the blocks that you're going to cross to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.920 
the blocks that you're going to cross to
the<00:00:47.969> door<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:49.910> whether<00:00:50.910> blocks<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.780> not

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the door now whether blocks can they not

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.860 
the door now whether blocks can they not
move<00:00:52.230> me<00:00:53.360> play<00:00:54.360> God<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.960> move<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.789> um

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
move me play God here and move time um

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
move me play God here and move time um
we<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.170> pick<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.530> any<00:00:58.770> cubic<00:00:59.340> block

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we know they can pick up any cubic block

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.979 
we know they can pick up any cubic block
they'll<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> normal<00:01:00.719> blocks

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
they'll they don't the normal blocks

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.939 
they'll they don't the normal blocks
that<00:01:01.289> are<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.270> even<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
that are like this even if you have a

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
that are like this even if you have a
they<00:01:04.949> can't<00:01:05.220> move<00:01:05.339> slabs<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> double

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they can't move slabs but if you double

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
they can't move slabs but if you double
stack<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.350> slabs<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:09.049> here<00:01:10.670> if<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
stack the slabs which are here if you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
stack the slabs which are here if you
double<00:01:12.090> stack<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.960> becomes

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
double stack them like that it becomes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.810 
double stack them like that it becomes
like<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> normal<00:01:13.830> block<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.580> move

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like a normal block and they can move

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.960 
like a normal block and they can move
this<00:01:15.119> unfortunately<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.610> that's<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.820> going

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this unfortunately so that's not going

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.249 
this unfortunately so that's not going
to<00:01:18.060> work<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.400> far<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.810> posted<00:01:22.200> on

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to work but so far this was posted on

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.039 
to work but so far this was posted on
the<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> reddit<00:01:23.040> website<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.869> nice

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the on the reddit website a very nice

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
the on the reddit website a very nice
guy<00:01:25.229> i'll<00:01:25.409> link<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> thread<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.180> cannot

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
guy i'll link the thread but they cannot

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260 
guy i'll link the thread but they cannot
move<00:01:27.720> glass<00:01:28.500> panes<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> use<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
move glass panes so you can use that to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
move glass panes so you can use that to
build<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:31.229> cannot<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:31.650> any<00:01:32.189> type<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> slab

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
build they cannot move any type of slab

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
build they cannot move any type of slab
so<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.049> useful<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:35.520> cannot<00:01:35.850> move<00:01:36.090> these

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so it's useful they cannot move these

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
so it's useful they cannot move these
iron<00:01:36.540> bars<00:01:37.490> which<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.640> actually<00:01:38.939> really

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
iron bars which are actually really

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
iron bars which are actually really
really<00:01:39.329> cool<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.960> these<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:41.040> things

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
really cool I like these to make things

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
really cool I like these to make things
look<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.670> better<00:01:44.149> they<00:01:45.149> can't<00:01:45.390> move<00:01:45.509> fences

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
look much better they can't move fences

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.410 
look much better they can't move fences
obviously<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.729> move<00:01:47.970> any

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
obviously they can also not move any

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
obviously they can also not move any
type<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> stairs<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.470> Pistons<00:01:50.119> now<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:52.130> couple

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
type of stairs or Pistons now a couple

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
type of stairs or Pistons now a couple
more<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.700> need<00:01:53.970> more<00:01:54.149> testing<00:01:55.040> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
more things that need more testing so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
more things that need more testing so
specifically<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.909> want<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.600> say

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
specifically what I want to know is say

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
specifically what I want to know is say
an<00:01:58.259> Endermen<00:01:58.680> spawns<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.399> top<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> something

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
an Endermen spawns on top of something

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.679 
an Endermen spawns on top of something
so<00:02:00.420> say<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.520> spawning<00:02:02.520> pad<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.390> trap

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so say we have a spawning pad and a trap

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.429 
so say we have a spawning pad and a trap
like<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
like this but I really want to know is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
like this but I really want to know is
if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.610> put<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:08.970> red<00:02:09.209> stone<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.720> pressure

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
if you put like red stone or pressure

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570 
if you put like red stone or pressure
plates<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.500> anything<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.860> top<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> block

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
plates or anything on top of the block

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.840 
plates or anything on top of the block
can<00:02:12.270> they<00:02:12.420> move<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.959> block<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
can they move that block if there

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.720 
can they move that block if there
standing<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.420> top<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.950> now<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.310> really<00:02:16.340> is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
standing on top of it now that really is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
standing on top of it now that really is
the<00:02:16.820> question<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.900> works<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.800> they<00:02:19.070> can't

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the question if that works if they can't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.060 
the question if that works if they can't
move<00:02:19.460> this<00:02:19.670> block<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.210> we<00:02:20.360> have<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> viable

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
move this block then we have a viable

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.390 
move this block then we have a viable
way<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.100> trap<00:02:22.490> them<00:02:22.750> i<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.590> can't<00:02:24.950> test<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
way to trap them i I can't test that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.670 
way to trap them i I can't test that
right<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:25.820> unfortunately<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.260> someone

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
right now unfortunately I have someone

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.230 
right now unfortunately I have someone
that's<00:02:27.800> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.040> make<00:02:28.220> me<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.490> special<00:02:28.880> map

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that's going to make me a special map

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.590 
that's going to make me a special map
for<00:02:29.510> me<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.690> test<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.110> hopefully<00:02:30.830> tomorrow<00:02:31.600> so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
for me to test it hopefully tomorrow so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.210 
for me to test it hopefully tomorrow so
I<00:02:32.630> maybe<00:02:33.230> we'll<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.470> able<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.620> get<00:02:33.740> back<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
I maybe we'll be able to get back to you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520 
I maybe we'll be able to get back to you
with<00:02:34.400> more<00:02:34.700> details<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:36.200> basically

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
with more details on that but basically

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.890 
with more details on that but basically
what<00:02:36.650> i<00:02:36.710> would<00:02:36.920> do<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:37.970> put<00:02:38.240> signs<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:38.810> around

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
what i would do is put signs all around

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.430 
what i would do is put signs all around
the<00:02:39.140> block<00:02:39.350> then<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:41.080> basically<00:02:42.080> water

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the block then have basically water

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.340 
the block then have basically water
underneath<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.960> hopefully<00:02:44.960> they'll<00:02:45.110> fall

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
underneath and hopefully they'll fall

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.930 
underneath and hopefully they'll fall
right<00:02:45.590> off<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.860> block<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.430> into<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.820> water

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
right off the block and into the water

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.820 
right off the block and into the water
and<00:02:47.240> die<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.200> that'll<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.530> an<00:02:48.590> effective

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
and die and that'll be an effective

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.000 
and die and that'll be an effective
Endermen<00:02:49.490> trap<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:49.910> hoping<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.770> got<00:02:51.890> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
Endermen trap I'm hoping we just got to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.700 
Endermen trap I'm hoping we just got to
figure<00:02:52.160> out<00:02:52.840> under<00:02:53.840> what<00:02:54.050> conditions<00:02:54.590> they

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
figure out under what conditions they

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.560 
figure out under what conditions they
can<00:02:55.070> or<00:02:55.220> cannot<00:02:55.460> move<00:02:55.640> blocks<00:02:55.910> if<00:02:56.240> things<00:02:56.450> are

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
can or cannot move blocks if things are

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.130 
can or cannot move blocks if things are
attached<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.020> them<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.470> for<00:02:58.430> instance<00:02:58.520> if<00:02:59.140> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
attached to them so for instance if it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.840 
attached to them so for instance if it
redstone<00:03:00.620> top<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.070> block<00:03:01.190> or<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.610> pressure

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
redstone top of a block or a pressure

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.880 
redstone top of a block or a pressure
plate<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.990> said<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.290> still<00:03:03.560> untested

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
plate like I said this is still untested

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.560 
plate like I said this is still untested
but<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.310> anyone<00:03:04.520> can<00:03:04.670> test<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.420> get<00:03:05.540> back

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
but if anyone can test this and get back

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.140 
but if anyone can test this and get back
to<00:03:05.930> me<00:03:05.960> then<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> think<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.550> have<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.700> working

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
to me then I think we have a working

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.200 
to me then I think we have a working
trap<00:03:08.420> if<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.840> works<00:03:09.400> now<00:03:10.400> another<00:03:11.120> thing

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
trap if this works now another thing

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.570 
trap if this works now another thing
needs<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.600> tested<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.920> Endermen<00:03:13.340> move

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
needs to be tested can Endermen move

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.380 
needs to be tested can Endermen move
blocks<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.270> are<00:03:14.680> moved<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:15.680> Pistons<00:03:16.390> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
blocks that are moved by Pistons you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.660 
blocks that are moved by Pistons you
know<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:18.020> other<00:03:18.170> words<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.950> Pistons

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
know in other words this Pistons

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.790 
know in other words this Pistons
extended<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.270> moving<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.600> block<00:03:20.870> this

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
extended and moving this block this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.260 
extended and moving this block this
block<00:03:22.010> technically<00:03:22.580> has<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> different<00:03:23.150> item

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
block technically has a different item

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.970 
block technically has a different item
value<00:03:23.570> since<00:03:23.930> been<00:03:24.110> since<00:03:24.380> it's<00:03:24.500> being<00:03:24.650> moved

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
value since been since it's being moved

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.670 
value since been since it's being moved
by<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.190> piston<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:26.110> don't<00:03:27.110> think<00:03:27.170> Bob's<00:03:27.440> can

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
by a piston I don't think Bob's can

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.040 
by a piston I don't think Bob's can
spawn<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.160> top<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.520> these<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.810> worth

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
spawn on top of these but it's worth

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.790 
spawn on top of these but it's worth
looking<00:03:30.740> into<00:03:30.800> anyway<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.690> those<00:03:33.560> are<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.710> few

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
looking into anyway so those are a few

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.560 
looking into anyway so those are a few
of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> things<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.610> we<00:03:34.730> need<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.180> get<00:03:35.390> more

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
of the things that we need to get more

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.100 
of the things that we need to get more
testing<00:03:36.080> on<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.400> results<00:03:37.790> should<00:03:37.910> be

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
testing on and the results should be

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.530 
testing on and the results should be
pretty<00:03:39.110> interesting<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:41.270> want<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
pretty interesting so I just want to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.240 
pretty interesting so I just want to
give<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:41.870> short<00:03:42.230> update<00:03:42.590> I'm<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
give you this short update I'm going to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.430 
give you this short update I'm going to
keep<00:03:43.460> testing<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.180> working<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.750> new<00:03:44.870> 1.8

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
keep testing and working on the new 1.8
