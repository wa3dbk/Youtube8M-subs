00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120
 Happy 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.560
 Yes 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:22.790
 The following is a step the next step is a little difficult for those who have seen it is an 8-bit this 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.430
 I think it's a little step like you think, but I think it will be quite fun if you try it 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.580
 I want to teach you a little 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.689
 It seems that the name is not 8 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 Is do or is called by the name say breath something this getting light 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.739
 but 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.550
 In fact because its getting light including also probably many of or rather Sosho 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.040
 The name of this step just by saying the dance popular in the area there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 It's not, but once in us we watch as much on the team as Tottori Freon 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.430
 There is a step out that I would like to tell you a little 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.100
 8 First we will go from 8 right foot 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.880
 Right foot 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.550
 A little this department feelings became Ricco chan 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.330
 I feel like I can open the piece, I will pull this left foot against it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.909
 And then this time will be in-the foot sometimes became flirts her left foot 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 Is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 Yes, it's basically important to use only toes 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.220
 There is no need to become a basic solid foot or a heel 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 There is there is I think a very simple but as much as possible in the child toe 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.940
