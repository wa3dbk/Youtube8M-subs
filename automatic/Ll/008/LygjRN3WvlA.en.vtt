rollin<00:00:37.309> ok<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.760> Dominion<00:00:39.239> card<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
rollin ok so the Dominion card is

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
rollin ok so the Dominion card is
interesting<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.219> i<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
interesting because i think that the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.779 
interesting because i think that the
Dominion<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.530> definitely<00:00:44.370> definitely

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
Dominion would definitely definitely

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.959 
Dominion would definitely definitely
benefit<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:45.719> having<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.500> fleet<00:00:47.280> captain<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
benefit from having a fleet captain that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.380 
benefit from having a fleet captain that
has<00:00:48.180> plus<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.170> their<00:00:49.289> commands<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.649> like

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
has plus two to their commands go like

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
has plus two to their commands go like
because<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:52.050> whole<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.770> fleet<00:00:53.010> just

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
because as a whole the fleet just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.810 
because as a whole the fleet just
doesn't<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.969> many<00:00:54.539> high<00:00:55.640> cannot<00:00:56.640> scale

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
doesn't have as many high cannot scale

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
doesn't have as many high cannot scale
captain's<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> say<00:00:57.960> federation<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.219> know

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
captain's is say federation but you know

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
captain's is say federation but you know
nobody<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.850> does<00:01:00.109> but<00:01:01.109> being<00:01:01.440> able<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.739> go

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
nobody really does but being able to go

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.990 
nobody really does but being able to go
first<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.589> important<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.000> getting

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
first is a important thing for getting

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
first is a important thing for getting
things<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.510> Ed<00:01:06.780> tease<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.580> really

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
things off like Ed tease so I can really

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
things off like Ed tease so I can really
see<00:01:09.150> how<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> benefit<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.439> like

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
see how that is a benefit I also like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.520 
see how that is a benefit I also like
the<00:01:10.920> fact<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.939> faction<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:12.869> has<00:01:13.290> an

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the fact that the faction side has an

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
the fact that the faction side has an
elite<00:01:13.740> talent<00:01:13.979> upgrade<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> might<00:01:15.689> have

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
elite talent upgrade on now I might have

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.789 
elite talent upgrade on now I might have
mentioned<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> other

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
mentioned some of some of the other

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.880 
mentioned some of some of the other
videos<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.509> elite<00:01:18.750> talent<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.560> card

if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.970> taking<00:01:21.119> captain<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.780> guard

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
if you are taking captain on this guard

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
if you are taking captain on this guard
who<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.590> only<00:01:22.770> talent<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> makes<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
who also has only talent it makes that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
who also has only talent it makes that
Italy<00:01:24.540> tell<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> free<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.400> pretty

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Italy tell it free and that is pretty

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
Italy tell it free and that is pretty
spectacular<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
spectacular and I think I think that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
spectacular and I think I think that
makes<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.790> value<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.240> card<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.659> little

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
makes the value of this card a little

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.819 
makes the value of this card a little
bit<00:01:31.020> higher<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.710> don't<00:01:32.400> necessarily<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.299> if

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
bit higher I don't necessarily know if

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.929 
bit higher I don't necessarily know if
people<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> scrambling<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.909> try

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
people are going to be scrambling to try

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.749 
people are going to be scrambling to try
to<00:01:36.180> use<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> card<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.189> free<00:01:38.460> tech

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.999 
to use this card to get their free tech
upgrade<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.570> mean<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> useful<00:01:40.650> thing

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
upgrade I mean it's it's a useful thing

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
upgrade I mean it's it's a useful thing
if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.509> yeah<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.049> got<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
if you have it it's like yeah I got it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
if you have it it's like yeah I got it
and<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.189> well<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.880> don't

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and right as well but I don't

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
and right as well but I don't
necessarily<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.920> thing

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
necessarily think that it is the thing

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
necessarily think that it is the thing
that<00:01:47.130> people<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.700> taking<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.090> card<00:01:48.360> for

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that people will be taking this card for

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
that people will be taking this card for
um<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.040> additional<00:01:50.700> crew<00:01:50.970> upgrade<00:01:51.420> given<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
um the additional crew upgrade given the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
um the additional crew upgrade given the
choices<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.369> might<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:54.000> useful<00:01:54.229> but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:56.100> think

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
choices now might be useful but I think

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.069 
choices now might be useful but I think
that<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:58.290> card<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.969> okay<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.479> for

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that this card is it's okay for for

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.830

out<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.409> pack<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.829> great<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.220> 400

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
pretty soon um where he is actually

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.840

captain<00:02:39.180> card<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.130> independent<00:02:41.760> side<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
captain card on the independent side and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.350 
captain card on the independent side and
I<00:02:42.870> think<00:02:43.290> he's<00:02:43.530> actually<00:02:43.709> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:45.180> he

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
I think he's actually going to like he

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000 
I think he's actually going to like he
saved<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.930> many<00:02:46.020> points<00:02:46.440> doing<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.920> he

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
saved so many points doing it that he

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.380 
saved so many points doing it that he
was<00:02:47.100> able<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.459> grow<00:02:47.610> his<00:02:47.640> weight<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.209> that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
was able to grow his weight just that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.510 
was able to grow his weight just that
much<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.570> because<00:02:49.140> when<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.709> play<00:02:49.740> 250

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
much more because when you play 250

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.240 
much more because when you play 250
points<00:02:50.930> being<00:02:51.930> able<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.440> value<00:02:53.040> in

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
points being able to have that value in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.310 
points being able to have that value in
your<00:02:53.550> fleet<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.850> incredible<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.750> five<00:02:55.020> point

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
that I I don't know if in Opie events

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.550

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
tournament resources cuz I I think that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.090 
tournament resources cuz I I think that
in<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.570> Opie<00:03:18.840> event<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.290> Hideki<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.830> still

in the Opie event the Hideki is still
pretty<00:03:21.000> outstanding<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:22.049> think<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
pretty outstanding I think that in the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.060 
pretty outstanding I think that in the
Opie<00:03:23.130> event<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.239> really<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:25.920> really

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
Opie event you can really you can really

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.160 
Opie event you can really you can really
do<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> little<00:03:26.519> bit<00:03:26.670> more<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.870> get<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.080> little

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
do a little bit more and get a little

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.729 
do a little bit more and get a little
bit<00:03:28.380> more<00:03:28.530> value<00:03:28.980> out<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.190> other<00:03:30.110> cards<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.440> i

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
bit more value out of other cards but i

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.380 
bit more value out of other cards but i
don't<00:03:32.250> know<00:03:32.489> i<00:03:32.549> think<00:03:32.670> when<00:03:33.000> i<00:03:33.030> look<00:03:33.239> at<00:03:33.299> the
