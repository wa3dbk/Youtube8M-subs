00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.030
 Hello I read here on the law of the days 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.920
 discarded cars abandoned 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.539
 car equates car in 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.840
 which can penetrate which 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.060
 smashed the glass door can be opened 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.520
 missing door hidden roof like there 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 it was written or broken headlamp that 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.940
 strange to such a car 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.860
 related organs affix 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.140
 Contact us 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.120
 if during the month the owner is not 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.519
 connect it can not find in any way 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.940
 the car is evacuating to the parking lot where it is 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.569
 worth two more months here if 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.699
 car owner appears then he will go 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:52.030
 a fine of two to five thousand 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.550
 rubles plus the amount to pay for parking 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.289
 for you to 40 rubles per hour that is 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.600
 You can run quite a tidy sum 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.620
 in two months, if he doesn't 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 a car appears just recycles 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.850
 and therefore there is a question as if it 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.760
 i'm not afraid even somehow fails 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.250
 find the owner of the car that is me 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.060
 It seems every car should know 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.970
 who is the owner 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.860
 and somehow find it seems to me should not 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.900
 make problems well, in general, the essence is not in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.910
 This is the essence of what the essence is that for example 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.170
 you stole a car ride on 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.620
 him and thrown somewhere the devil knows where 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.590
 breaking his glass there 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.360
 noticed put a piece of paper on you 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.960
 not found because most likely and not 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.870
 searched and then he was parked and in 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 eventually recycled that is almost 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.990
 it weird doesn't seem like more 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790
 efforts to make these bodies and find out 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.340
 not at all the circumstances why 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.600
 the car is abandoned, that is, if suddenly 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.660
 a man in prison that is decreases here by 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.240
 thundered there for a few years turned 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.190
 and the car is not there and it is clear and the girls are not 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 they will take and will not give time 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.280
 rearrange the car do not know where 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.590
 Anything and friends of the city that she is so 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.270
 need this situation water itself 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.980
 interesting what where am i near 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.980
 precinct point is not individuals and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:38.260
 near how do you see the water that stand 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:42.010
 already ate drawing how much that is here 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.569
 such an interesting situation 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.290
 in general, see the third selection of machines 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.750
 which I found 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.439
 and maybe someone will find his 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.439
 losing 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.360

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.569
 news here 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.860
 seconds 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.250
 and bear 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 earlier to take 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.500
 yiruma trilesy 1 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.030
 don't get breathless 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.030
 legs themselves carry a shooting range from anyway 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.600
 fleeing from a lump lying on the floor vtec 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.100

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.030
 Sarov 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.030
 i have holsten 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.030
 irradiation 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.780
 May 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.430
 hopes for and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.430
 further and somewhere 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.870
 sleep at night 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.080
 this 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:46.109
 incomprehensible situation with these abandoned 

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:47.939
 cars on the one hand need to somehow 

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:49.379
 you can fight them from the other side 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.879
 accidentally dispose of someone 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.439
 property which they manually 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.609
 just left for the duration 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:58.379
 but there are such breeds here 

00:04:55.609 --> 00:05:00.319
 just any for drug addicts and 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.459
 other crap that needs to be removed altogether 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.189
 urgent order seems to me not even 

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:07.769
 necessarily for this month this 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.459
 stick a piece of paper on your machines 

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:13.439
 so on the ball the car is abandoned and the owner 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:18.259
 either scored on her or and just 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.259
 dissolved like something in the air 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.229
