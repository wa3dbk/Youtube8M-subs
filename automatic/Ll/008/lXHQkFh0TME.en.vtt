00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.750
 today you have given a great satisfaction 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.550
 to your fans who keep us 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.590
 very much to win the derby though 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 even a draw would have come closer 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.219
 to the championship in a clear way now me 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 missing just one point was already 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 celebrating or not giving up either 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 now claudio no we must not give up 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.949
 also because it is true that we are very much 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 neighbors for the next game 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.400
 we meet the palermo that we want 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 absolutely save so it will not come 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.410
 to participate in any party possible 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.510
 in torino therefore it will be a tough game and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.100
 it is true that one point is enough but 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.090
 we go on the pitch always to try to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.309
 doing result 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.829
 we are doing very well in 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.690
 this last month passes where we have 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.730
 made the seventh win in a row that 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.949
 they were really the games that we had 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.500
 have led to winning almost this 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.530
 Scudetto now two goals in the first leg 1 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.890
 even today you feel more and more in Turin 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.890
 derby man 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.360
 definitely it brings so I did well 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.940
 three goals in two games always nice in the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.670
 derby then beyond this era 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.790
 It is essential to win one today 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 day where 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 first it goes very strong with the turin where 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 he had already shown of going 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 be a great team to get in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.290
 difficulty however this time in the return is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.320
 managed to prepare it much better ea 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.960
 suffer 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.720
 to suffer less and then how it happens 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.390
 often in 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 our matches towards the end with fate 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.700
 of work than doing another 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.289
 week 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.450
 definitely quality and freshness 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.170
 we were then able to solve this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 game because this aurelio excuses a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.659
 moment because we are really the one in 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.429
 pizzetti look forward to the last thing 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.399
 I wanted to ask marchisio and this one 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.560
 even today it was used at the beginning ho 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.429
 deployed at the beginning in the most position 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.990
 advance 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.549
 you like this position or think that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.720
 we are a contingent discourse for this 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.610
 season finale ie that of 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.590
 play probably closer than 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.759
 vucinic i say free of inserted 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.189
 more but if a speech that must 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.659
 last only for this purpose of 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.610
 championship also for next year 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.380
 you don't have to ask me and the coach 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.239
 that decides however beyond this me 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 I have found good since the first 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.640
 then left with mirko but also with 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.069
 my other companions from unatras attack 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 final when we work being a 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.239
 midfielder are more led to 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.569
 play the ball to move around a lot 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.180
 so I always manage to move well with 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.700
 them therefore it is not is not they are not 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.410
 definitely a first striker though in 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.150
 that position I can find a lot 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.290
 well it is a flexible player this is 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.060
 important for all coaches 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.120
 including antonio conte thanks e 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.930
 congratulations but I guess it's not 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.609
 it was your fault 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.319
 But one thing I want to ask you is I can 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:49.569
 already saluting as a two-champion coach 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.579
 d'Italia si ma maicon punto are missing 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.680
 four games 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.160
 let's say that the commas are missing 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.230
 they are missing so just really missing 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.010
 very little the frame 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.599
 in the photo above all from juventus and not 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.909
 I really pass the scudetto now like 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.170
 again as a great answer to 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.239
 compact group in a derby 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.299
 as difficult as it probably should have been 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.220
 being is but I would add there is a value 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.500
 on this group more in the last three 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.069
 Vidal matches decisive 4 goals in three 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.530
 games 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.660
 in short, great response once again 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.840
 from the Chilean yes even if today art 1 ho 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.370
 definitely made an important one for one 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.510
 performance perhaps less good than the others 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.620
 but sometimes you always need to do so 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.569
 splitting the two things he can do 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.220
 definitely much much better with won 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.629
 with palermo it will surely do a lot 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.440
 better then maybe I will mark again 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:48.190
 then I repeat it's that until I do 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.470
 we have that little triangle in our hands but the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.950
 I will hammer to the end 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.230
 I will not take away or give aa merits 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 one more in the other this already said e 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.380
 vidal is already the first on the list of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.910
 hammering so in short it is as much as to say 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.540
 I study because I know there are many 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.880
 questions 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.140
 yes someone also through the internet and 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.610
 also from abroad before hearing 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.740
 but that one I make an ia to antonio 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.780
 count even today is deployed marchisio a 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.010
 sheltered by vucinic 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.540
 there is a bit of regret for not having it 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.959
 done against the bayern maybe a monk 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.630
 antonio but there can be no regret 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.980
 because vucinic had a fever 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.760
 i love to play with a single tip to play 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.980
 with an extra midfielder 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.150
 in the beginning there was the idea I repeat 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.150
 vucinic then 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.000
 I had a fever because he missed the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.490
 match against not against the inter where 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.870
 they played those of mothers we have 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.890
 won they made two goals 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.740
 the two of them and has resumed training 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.200
 practically on the eve of the match not 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.460
 who knows me knows very well that grandfather 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.720
 no good there is a player who is 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
 train the neighbor next month 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.170
 missed five workouts are not not 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.060
 I'm the kind of coaches who takes it 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.440
 fielded at the expense we hear 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.460
 from abroad what they asked St. 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.990
 mitola morocco no from belgium mahmood 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.480
 he writes, I think Marco would be 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.980
 perfect for the afterthought as it thinks 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.110
 the priest but I think they will come in a 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.260
 paris saint germain player and stand 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.520
 well where is another question then 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.810
 I'll even compliment you from 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.070
 don alessio albertini I wanted 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.290
 greet you and then give the last question 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.510
 obviously francesco marino antonio is 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.770
 It was a championship you never had 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.750
 the feeling of being able to lose 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.920
 sincerely and you left with the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.570
 problem of not being able to go into 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.580
 bench with difficulties maybe that 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.310
 this could involve however you have 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.300
 almost always held yours 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.280
 fate indeed we always say but I say 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.780
 sincerely 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.810
 until today I have always feared losing it 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.470
 this championship then from the first 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.080
 day there were no teams for sure 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.930
 someone very equipped 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.850
 forget that the juventus for nine 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.700
 eleventh the same juventus of the year 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.620
 last today they played in more asamoah 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.320
 and we are the same as the year 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.060
 last when they told us that 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.570
 however there is no champion juventus 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.510
 next year will start from the same 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.800
 to the same and this shows that 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.550
 something foreign we did 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.440
 and maybe someone else got caught 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.450
 and it was not so good because 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.130
 then I hear that everyone focuses on them 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.260
 goals are all happy I say 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.250
 that I too am happy with one hundred of 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.020
 these championships 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.670
 one hundred of these targets not focused 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.960
 alessio is fine if you want to do i 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.520
 congratulations to antonio conte because then 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.800
 the last question is entitled to 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.080
 francesco marino no i don't do them i 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.030
 congratulations because respect he said 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.980
 that I still lack in merit either 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.290
 arrived thanks then the point 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.120
 exclamation I give it to her when I did 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.950
 at the last point then I do them to him 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.360
 not even I, however, Antonio Sunday 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.950
 next we'll be waiting first is because 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.300
 then we break out of the broadcasts there 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.500
 He gets angry all the next time you 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.030
 we wait first starting with 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.100
 next Sunday when I believe that 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.030
 we will celebrate and congratulate the 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.220
 great if we put all the points 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.780
 francesco exclamation goes in closing not 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.340
 I wanted to get back to that question from 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.410
 internet though juventus is 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.540
 thinking of an afterthought because in short 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.640
 it is obvious that we are used to it 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.440
 how to say that teams are not made 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.020
 certainly when the championships are over 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.690
 evaluations start first but juventus 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.510
 must think of everything must think 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.090
 first to sew this second 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:24.390
 badge on the shirt would be something 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.940
 istat in the air after which they will be done 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.880
 necessary and careful evaluations on 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.680
 all inevitable as I said before 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.360
 that 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.190
 careful assessments had to be made 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.960
 we must not be comforted by the fact that we are 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.130
 come out against a super power against 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.160
 the bayern when we have to concentrate 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.270
 looking towards a revalued exit then 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.820
 in short, a real game we have 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.410
 since in any case thanks antonio conte 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.330
 and then we are finished here we salute 

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.680

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.680
