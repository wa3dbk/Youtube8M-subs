00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:09.200
 we are going to welcome Maria 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.509
 elisa grayolÃ­a like excellent you 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.940
 good to tell you that he was already 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.789
 a few years with us as artist of the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.189
 month but this time he comes to show us 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.289
 a different proposal sponsored by 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.539
 kilometers art workshops 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.939
 kilometers art these metro series and 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.400
 this time dabbling in the upholstery 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.580
 A) Yes 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.250
 good we have a real upholstery 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.210
 this is real upholstery here in the workshop 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 of arts here you can see all the materials 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 and how does this arise from the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.360
 restlessness that I always have to learn 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.149
 new techniques and give people 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 tools like to recover and give 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.780
 value to things that we have at home about 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 everything in this case we are talking about 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.360
 furniture specifically for furniture 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.170
 seats like this is born then the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.909
 technique has its turns is not difficult 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 the truth that all people can 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.869
 upholster a seat of these 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 features we do not go now the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.460
 larger upholstery of large armchairs 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 captains and all that not because I really 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.539
 already requires professionals and hillary that 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
 was dedicated many years ago and so that 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.100
 it can not be everyone the whole world 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 you can do it and it's once one 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.750
 know the materials I suppose you should 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.509
 be pretty easy and good once a 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 measure that is being put into practice 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.509
 you can arm your own furniture 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.520
 If they are going to fall in love they will fall in love 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.659
 because also starting as in this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.799
 I did what I brought 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.479
 the program is a footstep of what is 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.329
 the skeleton so raw a skeleton 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.479
 of wood we started with this piece and 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.130
 we can end up on a stool that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.749
 It is generally used as an armchair for 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.159
 children also because of the size that's why 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.469
 we choose this fabric and our colors 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.840
 but if it's for a good adult we have 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.340
 other forms of termination but if 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.469
 It really is a footstool but he uses it 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.359
 Much like a stool, I also tell you that 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.640
 is stepped on in the traditional way that 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.979
 we work that in conscience 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.470
 here a person feels comfortably and 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.470
 is perfect that is the cinch well for 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.720
 the chair was used cinch that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.829
 this does this is what they do 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.579
 the chairs and I think that in this if not 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:24.040
 I make a lot of mess you can see from behind 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.349
 when you put the cinch on, that's why 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.819
 leave it unfinished on purpose to 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.200
 fiselina out cloth 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.879
 termination where one never sees how 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.760
 things are done from the back but 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.739
 the tapes are placed like this is left behind 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.870
 lized and all this well together 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.800
 with the fiselina is what gives the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.000
 support 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.400
 I feel the proper 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.470
 marilis here what you see in the workshop 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.640
 what the workshop looks like is how to place 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.740
 a cinch 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.230
 and that will go in this part of the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.190
 wooden skeleton the cinches are 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.319
 place with these studs or with these 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.560
 tachas depending on the piece and the 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.010
 thickness of the wood after this is 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.890
 place a cloth on top of the cinch that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.630
 is a fiselina that is a finite fabric and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.600
 then the foam rubber is placed 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.360
 that there are different thicknesses 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 depending on the piece that we go to 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.380
 land and the type of support that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.300
 we need different 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.140
 types of termination and different types 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.530
 of fabrics for upholstery I will not talk 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.550
 specifically if it is a senile this or 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.920
 names that normally when one goes to 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.050
 a house of fabrics you will know 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.300
 recommend if it is a corduroy or fabrics that 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.560
 are specifically for upholstery in 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.590
 general, what I try to do is 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 discuss how the fabric has to be the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.500
 fabrics do not have to be elastic 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.850
 they have to have a bounce or that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.739
 also speak at the workshop because 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.930
 Sometimes there are some fabrics that are not 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.940
 upholstery so we can use them and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.200
 It depends on what piece of furniture we're going to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 apply also 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.040
 from there we have different 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.989
 most conventional terminations that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.080
 it's like they see it on this sidewalk 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.450
 that these flaws were applied that 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.519
 we have nickel-plated or have as they are 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.980
 afflicted and in this bronze color that 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.590
 they are as old as well after 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.530
 we have this type of determinations that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.910
 they have more to do with the trimmings 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.100
 as seen here that is applied in this 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.870
 today it is used a lot with fabrics with 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.760
 a lot of color that have to do with the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.220
 inia style that is very fashionable and 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.440
 everyone is asking good 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.900
 analyze then this workshop are you going to 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.030
 be giving in kilometer art in each 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.620
 ninis montegrande and also in your workshop 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.090
 and dedication of course the classes 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.130
 they are always that I am also in 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.169
 canning so they 're going to see us by the 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.780
 area a lot of time when then to 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.520
 get to practice and buy all 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.290
 the materials for this workshop 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.090
 you do not have to buy anything you do not have 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.889
 purchase nothing do not have to buy anything and 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.720
 They not have to give the materials entinas 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.580
 activated with the cable is like 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.110
 Goddesses can not be stopped at all 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.550
 we give it in the workshop that's the idea 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.820
 the little hands the desire and desire of 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.020
 work very well, thank you very much

 we continue with advancing
