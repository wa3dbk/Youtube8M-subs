00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
that the start and select button we're
blue<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:40.229> didn't<00:01:40.500> do

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that and they made them black so it's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.240
