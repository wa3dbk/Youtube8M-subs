okay<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:09.090> Binary<00:00:09.570> Domain<00:00:11.959> and<00:00:12.959> I

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
okay so that was Binary Domain and I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.299 
okay so that was Binary Domain and I
don't<00:00:13.260> really<00:00:13.410> know<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.709> feel<00:00:13.920> about<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
don't really know how I feel about the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.880 
don't really know how I feel about the
ending<00:00:14.700> there

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.970 

and<00:00:21.890> there<00:00:22.160> definitely<00:00:22.370> were<00:00:23.740> quite<00:00:24.740> some

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
and there definitely were quite some

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.859 
and there definitely were quite some
inconsistencies<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:26.869> logical<00:00:27.770> stuff

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
inconsistencies and this logical stuff

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.720 
inconsistencies and this logical stuff
happening<00:00:29.869> there<00:00:30.080> towards<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.590> end<00:00:31.570> like

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
happening there towards the end like

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.650 
happening there towards the end like
particularly<00:00:34.730> concerning<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:37.150> story<00:00:38.150> itself

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
particularly concerning the story itself

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.229 
particularly concerning the story itself
but<00:00:40.690> like<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.960> example<00:00:42.430> when<00:00:43.430> face<00:00:43.760> showed<00:00:44.030> up

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
but like for example when face showed up

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.650 
but like for example when face showed up
again<00:00:44.720> for<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.020> first<00:00:45.170> time<00:00:46.360> well<00:00:47.360> for<00:00:47.600> that

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
again for the first time well for that

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
really intriguing and could potentially

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.920 
really intriguing and could potentially
really<00:01:54.620> deep<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:56.030> know<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:56.690> just

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
really deep and you know really just

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.660 
really deep and you know really just
gripping<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:59.590> its<00:02:00.590> full<00:02:00.890> potential<00:02:01.310> would<00:02:01.610> be

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
gripping if its full potential would be

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.370 
gripping if its full potential would be
juiced<00:02:02.060> out<00:02:02.270> if<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.870> know<00:02:02.900> if<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.260> would

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
juiced out if it you know if it would

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.340 
juiced out if it you know if it would
flourish<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.160> it<00:02:05.150> can't<00:02:05.450> possibly<00:02:05.690> flourish

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
flourish and it can't possibly flourish

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.080 
flourish and it can't possibly flourish
because<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.770> really<00:02:06.980> big<00:02:07.130> theme<00:02:07.790> it's<00:02:08.030> a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
because it's a really big theme it's a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.119 
because it's a really big theme it's a
really<00:02:08.360> big<00:02:08.539> concept<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.890> couldn't

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
really big concept and it couldn't

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.940 
really big concept and it couldn't
possibly<00:02:10.190> flourish<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.950> relatively

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
possibly flourish in one relatively

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.680 
possibly flourish in one relatively
short<00:02:13.190> game<00:02:13.459> because<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.090> isn't<00:02:14.300> really

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
short game because this isn't really

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600 
short game because this isn't really
it's<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.349> under<00:02:15.709> 10<00:02:15.860> hours<00:02:16.129> definitely

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's like what under 10 hours definitely

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
what it is even despite this this really

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.679

big<00:03:58.949> shortcoming<00:03:59.949> the<00:04:00.729> poor<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.299> quality<00:04:01.599> of

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
big shortcoming the poor the quality of

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.309 
big shortcoming the poor the quality of
the<00:04:01.810> port<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.370> game<00:04:04.239> definitely<00:04:04.419> has<00:04:05.049> its

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
the port so the game definitely has its

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.979 
the port so the game definitely has its
qualities<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.949> game<00:04:06.099> definitely<00:04:06.750> isn't<00:04:07.750> bad

qualities the game definitely isn't bad

qualities the game definitely isn't bad
at<00:04:08.439> all<00:04:08.849> it's<00:04:09.849> just<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.209> core<00:04:10.479> so<00:04:10.930> I'm<00:04:11.099> I'm

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
at all it's just the core so I'm I'm

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.990 
at all it's just the core so I'm I'm
gonna<00:04:12.340> look<00:04:12.609> past<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:14.079> fact<00:04:14.379> it's<00:04:15.129> a<00:04:15.370> port<00:04:15.699> and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
gonna look past the fact it's a port and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.449 
gonna look past the fact it's a port and
I'm<00:04:16.120> just<00:04:16.299> going<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.780> charge<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.709> game<00:04:17.889> itself

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
I'm just going to charge the game itself

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.160 
I'm just going to charge the game itself
and<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:20.640> going<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.910> imagine<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.720> controls

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
and I'm going to imagine the controls

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.530 
and I'm going to imagine the controls
are<00:04:22.320> flawless<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.400> there<00:04:23.700> are<00:04:23.820> no<00:04:24.060> graphical

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
are flawless and there are no graphical

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.590 
are flawless and there are no graphical
glitches<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.050> all<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.410> jazz<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.520> if<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.420> even

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
glitches and all that jazz and if I even

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.510 
glitches and all that jazz and if I even
imagine<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.980> there<00:04:29.220> would

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
imagine that you know there would

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.410 
imagine that you know there would
actually<00:04:29.700> be<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:31.370> sequel<00:04:32.370> or<00:04:32.580> maybe<00:04:33.120> two

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
actually be a sequel or maybe two

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.020 
actually be a sequel or maybe two
sequels<00:04:33.870> or<00:04:34.230> whatever<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:38.550> could<00:04:38.730> be<00:04:38.790> pretty

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
sequels or whatever this could be pretty

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.380 
sequels or whatever this could be pretty
great<00:04:39.420> this<00:04:39.780> could<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.290> actually<00:04:41.150> one<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.180> the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
great this could be actually one of the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.100 
great this could be actually one of the
best<00:04:42.720> third-person<00:04:43.680> shooter<00:04:44.190> series<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
generation but it's not gonna be that if

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.740

there's no sequel and there probably is

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.270

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
not going to be any sequel because as I

for<00:07:01.809> the<00:07:01.929> overall<00:07:03.239> mood<00:07:04.239> and<00:07:04.449> premise<00:07:04.719> of<00:07:04.809> the

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:04.899 
for the overall mood and premise of the

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.749 
for the overall mood and premise of the
game<00:07:04.929> which<00:07:05.289> i<00:07:05.499> think<00:07:05.559> is<00:07:05.979> quite<00:07:06.159> dark<00:07:06.579> and

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
game which i think is quite dark and

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.189 
game which i think is quite dark and
depressing<00:07:09.029> but<00:07:10.029> again<00:07:10.359> if<00:07:10.629> this<00:07:10.869> was<00:07:11.169> a

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
depressing but again if this was a

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.409 
depressing but again if this was a
series<00:07:12.009> of<00:07:12.069> games<00:07:12.429> like<00:07:12.579> a<00:07:12.639> trilogy<00:07:12.999> or<00:07:13.179> these
