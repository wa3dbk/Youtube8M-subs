00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
they live in mud so obviously it needs

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
they live in mud so obviously it needs
to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> washed<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.859> want

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
to be washed very well and then you want

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.230 
to be washed very well and then you want
to<00:01:02.129> sit<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:03.739> face<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.070> here's<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.549> see

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the shells open so that one usually

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.929 
the shells open so that one usually
means<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.360> dead<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.439> full<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> mud<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
a 425-degree oven to release the muscle

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
a 425-degree oven to release the muscle
and<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.100> slightly<00:01:41.310> steam<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:41.970> we

cold<00:01:53.790> war<00:01:54.090> ice<00:01:54.390> water<00:01:54.750> releases<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> back

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
cold war ice water releases the back

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
cold war ice water releases the back

want to find you want to put the largest
shell<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> bottom<00:02:02.450> there's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> hinge<00:02:03.899> back

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
shell on the bottom there's a hinge back

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.410 
shell on the bottom there's a hinge back
here<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.560> larger<00:02:04.890> shell<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> smaller

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
here there's a larger shell is a smaller

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
here there's a larger shell is a smaller
top<00:02:06.719> shell<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.710> open<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> oyster<00:02:08.429> through

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
top shell you open the oyster through

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
top shell you open the oyster through
the<00:02:08.700> hinge<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.780> need<00:02:10.020> an<00:02:10.140> oyster<00:02:10.590> knife<00:02:10.619> but

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the hinge you need an oyster knife but

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.339 
the hinge you need an oyster knife but
since<00:02:11.280> they're<00:02:11.459> steamed<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:13.050> easier

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
since they're steamed a little easier

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.800 
since they're steamed a little easier
you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.670 

then<00:02:18.810> hinge<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.660> cut<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.840> adductor<00:02:22.290> muscle

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
then hinge and cut the adductor muscle

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.160 
then hinge and cut the adductor muscle
right<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:23.790> cut<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.330> other<00:02:24.540> adductor

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
right and then cut the other adductor

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.350 
right and then cut the other adductor
muscle<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.790> an<00:02:26.880> oyster<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.270> half

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
muscle so you have an oyster on the half

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.979 
muscle so you have an oyster on the half
shell<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.110> that's<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
shell right so that's what that is so we

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.570 
shell right so that's what that is so we
steam<00:02:30.989> them<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.410> little<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> they

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
steam them a little bit so that they

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.330 
steam them a little bit so that they
would<00:02:32.730> open<00:02:32.850> easier<00:02:36.770> then<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.040> show<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
would open easier then you can show that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.820 
would open easier then you can show that
if<00:02:38.730> want<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.970> serve<00:02:39.270> them

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
if want to serve them

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.380 
if want to serve them

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
there's a nice oyster on the half shell

your shell on the outside so want to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.840 
your shell on the outside so want to
release<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.680> muscles<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.489> muscle

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
release the muscles so that the muscle

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.550 
release the muscles so that the muscle
the<00:02:57.120> adductor<00:02:57.690> muscle<00:02:58.080> though<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.410> an

the adductor muscle though that's an

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.890 
the adductor muscle though that's an
oyster<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:01.049> then<00:03:01.280> make<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.900> oyster

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
oyster so that I can then make my oyster

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
oyster so that I can then make my oyster
stew<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.170> oyster<00:03:04.799> liquor<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.400> call<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.730> you

stew that oyster liquor we call it you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.130 
stew that oyster liquor we call it you
don't<00:03:05.910> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> lose<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.299> nice<00:03:06.600> liquid

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
that's in it at sea flavor so the top

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.690 
that's in it at sea flavor so the top
shell<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.670> discard<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:13.769> one<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.370> think

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
shell you discard this one I think

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.720 
shell you discard this one I think
steamed<00:03:15.000> over<00:03:15.180> already<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.100> snap

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
steamed over already so we just snap

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.349 
that open that's a beautiful specimen
though<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.019> needs<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.350> be<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.799> side

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
though it needs to be on that side

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.449 
though it needs to be on that side
because<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.720> want<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.989> have<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.380> oyster<00:03:25.950> in
