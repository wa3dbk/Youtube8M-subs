 Talk about free if I stay with the author 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 took shape with this book tells the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 story of my one teenager from 17 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.810
 years and already she was in a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 ride with your parents on the road and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 visit the couple of friends and then 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.980
 visit grandparents and I do not want this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 of this incident an accident occurs with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.739
 the car they were on 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 This is her family, and she's 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.590
 I want only brother, go and her parents. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.989
 as the car overturns the first 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 thing that mine does and that she 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.649
 I was lying in the snow and she's going to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.960
 her parents she sees her father dead and 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.079
 describes part of the hopes of the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 his brain at the party and it was a 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 that left me half creepy even because 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 did training and she sees her parents dead 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 and she thinks her brother and so the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 less for bikes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 she goes to his brother to see if he 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 was fine and when she sees an arm in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.439
 half the snow will attract her will make a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.799
 beautiful and it's actually her and her body 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.830
 wondering if he's dead to ride? 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.740
 a look is happening and little time 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.049
 then comes the craving and takes her body 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.960
 the hospital because she was alive only 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.720
 It's kind of like her soul was out of the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.299
 her body and in the course of the book 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.729
 talking how is the day in mine at 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.729
 It's her lungs, just look. 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.500
 the brain is injured she takes has a 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.080
 comment from a doctor who said that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.940
 It just ends as soon as I 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.869

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.420

 that she wants if she wants to live with her 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.929

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.500
 She is also her boyfriend, the Adrian, and he is 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.040

 dating her now he's guitarist 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.840
 she is in doubt if she struggles to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.970
 live all she give up everything 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.410
 going through the chapters of the book that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.720
 are named by the time of each scene she 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.480
 keeps remembering having flashes of life 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.060
 her and when I was younger 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.489
 when she met Adam about the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 of her younger brother in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.900
 a scene in the book that is faith in the beginning 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.090
 when she arrives at the hospital that little 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 after the adam her boyfriend knows that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.049
 hospital only they can not enter 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.540
 that do not know to see it because they do not 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.640
 are part of her family so the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.150
 nurses and security guards barring them only 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.130
 that with the rockstar that the media donated 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.940
 She's a singer from a well-known band. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.430
 already can count on the hospital makes an iron 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.920
 inside and he runs off with him and will 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 even mine and he was like that 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 he is shocked by her situation and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.400
 My own says that it is difficult for 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.409
 she sees the people she gov br 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.840

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.700
 The way these Mexes are going 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.489
 from the book he alone 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.379
 flashes her random memories 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.420
 but are things that match what is 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.909
 happening at the moment with her by 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.579
 example is the spirit of it is 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.609
 always watching and for example is this 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.319
 side is italy along with it she will se 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.950
 remembering moments that happened 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.140
 larry with Joaquim's and their grandparents 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.010
 makes of them she remembers the whole 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.750
 her life 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.030
 the medium has a detail that touches 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.780
 cello her favorite instrument 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.870
 It's her life she's in that instrument. 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.310
 This is a beautiful story. 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.340
 Another drama is another drama like that. 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 It's got parts so it really plays 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.769
 your heart making one is I cried in 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.940
 a part mainly in the scene that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.160
 her grandpa 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.380
 go and see her and he will say some things 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.690
 It will not be too much for her. 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 I just had to happen today and do not 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 cry softly 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.610
 around me a lot of people there the show 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.610
 at that time I felt many then this 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.379
 last time as he or 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.190
 to realize from the story that he loves 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.800
 she 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.650
 and it was in this book that you did not 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.870
 Do you know if you are happy or sad because 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.360
 You do not know how you're being understood. 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.789
 well if it's the same china is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.240
 happening to you, think about it or not 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.909
 which leaves a bit confusing and we need to leave 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.969
 something in the second book that is the cloud 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:03.759
 office was something in itself but still 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.940
 He does not have it in Portuguese and Spanish. 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.599
 that I went behind I do not understand much 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.169
 well but you have to throw right back 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.930

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.539

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.740
