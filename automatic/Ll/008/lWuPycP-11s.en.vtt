00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
think it was soo j was very very low at

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269 
think it was soo j was very very low at
that<00:00:27.599> point<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.800> went<00:00:29.010> back<00:00:29.160> in

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that point and then just went back in

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
that point and then just went back in
him<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> little<00:00:30.359> deceptive<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
him now this is a little deceptive it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
him now this is a little deceptive it
looks<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.590> finale<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.430> back<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.759> game

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
looks like finale got back in the game

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
looks like finale got back in the game
but<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.360> should<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.809> cautious<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.500> are

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
but you should be cautious here they are

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
but you should be cautious here they are
still<00:00:34.860> behind<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> great<00:00:36.510> team<00:00:36.809> fight

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and i really liked seeing that that sort

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
and i really liked seeing that that sort
of<00:00:39.510> team<00:00:40.260> fight<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.160> still<00:00:41.430> behind

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of team fight but they are still behind

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
of team fight but they are still behind

and yeah very much so that inhibitor is
still<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.210> don't<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
still down they don't really want to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389

make<00:00:46.020> too<00:00:46.200> many<00:00:46.320> moves<00:00:46.590> until<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> inhibitor

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
make too many moves until that inhibitor

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
make too many moves until that inhibitor

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
place is going to be eliminated today I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.180 
place is going to be eliminated today I
assume<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:50.900> Pacific<00:04:51.590> just<00:04:51.770> lost<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.160> game

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
assume that Pacific just lost the game

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.080 
assume that Pacific just lost the game
so<00:04:53.380> Pacific<00:04:54.380> are<00:04:54.530> probably<00:04:54.860> out<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.039> this<00:04:55.310> they

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
so Pacific are probably out of this they

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.909 
so Pacific are probably out of this they
yeah<00:04:56.300> they<00:04:56.330> were<00:04:56.630> more<00:04:57.139> possibly<00:04:57.560> could<00:04:57.770> be

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
yeah they were more possibly could be
