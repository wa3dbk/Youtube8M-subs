00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.899
 unique underwater operation on black 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:04.229
 Russian sea for the first time 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.230
 Bulgarian divers start work on 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.910
 Soviet ships who died in the years 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.090
 Great Patriotic War 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.509
 cellars of bulgaria 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.609
 from the expedition is our month 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.609
 correspondent Alexander Evstigneev 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.730
 they are going plunged at 60 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 meters there at the bottom of the black sea lies 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 one of the mysteries of the second world 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.440
 Soviet submarine 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.440
 while there are only suggestions what 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.940
 and if everything is confirmed then this is 24 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.550
 times and that's what its December forty second 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 of the year 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 Estimated at all if you take it exploded 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.160
 on mine in mention of the list of crew members 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.340
 stored in Sevastopol 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.130
 museum in combat 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.970
 submariners submarine led 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.260
 2 4 times up to 50 people 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.580
 but then the last hike from 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.850
 which failed for some reason 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.520
 reasons were 57 people did not return 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.239
 no one 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.640
 it was the biggest loss 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 Soviet submarine fleet on 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.120
 black sea boat and winery to 24 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.670
 intended for setting mines 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.140
 barricades went to sea in december forty 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.190
 the second 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.460
 most likely that 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.660
 Valuev Novorossiysk 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 by the way this fact that it was built 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.040
 many families treated 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130
 wide she got first half 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.940
 this year 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.090
 he is the same mood of birth she is like 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 the rule is minefields in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.020
 Novgorod the Great first shots from the scene 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 death in 24 most likely it is she 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 up to 67 years old submarine pretty overgrown 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.270
 shells 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.750
 but it is well guessed conning tower nasal 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.079
 large-caliber guns 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.869
 the gun and here is the boat's hole really 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.270
 exploded mine 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 besides died 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 we will look for an identification 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.630
 number and they are on the guns they should 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.920
 to be large they should be on 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 as transfers infotag they should be in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.610
 one hand area but full confidence in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 that this is the submarine 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 give an asset to the magazine 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.970
 so in the coming days, Russian and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.560
 Bulgarian divers will try 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.920
 penetrate inside the submarine I again 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.179
 poltavtsa recognize she will not just stop 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:10.609
 be 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.359
 nameless sunken objects 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.049
 the remains will be fraternal 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.149
 burial places are protected 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.839
 international law 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.989
 it is forbidden for lovers to dive 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.059
 for souvenirs 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.149
 and of course the village council
