00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
decent start right there let's take a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.419 
decent start right there let's take a
look<00:02:08.780> at<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.929> little<00:02:09.170> orem<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:09.799> as<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.250> see

look at a little orem if as you can see

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.509 
look at a little orem if as you can see
island<00:02:11.150> ends<00:02:11.269> there<00:02:13.329> and<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:16.280> basically

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
island ends there and that's basically

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.309 
island ends there and that's basically
it<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.030> don't<00:02:17.209> think<00:02:17.269> there's<00:02:17.569> any<00:02:17.750> trees<00:02:18.140> on

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319

it I don't think there's any trees on
this<00:02:18.410> island<00:02:18.849> I'm<00:02:19.849> pretty<00:02:20.090> sure<00:02:20.329> they<00:02:20.480> aren't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
this island I'm pretty sure they aren't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.589 
this island I'm pretty sure they aren't
in<00:02:20.810> fact<00:02:21.880> anyways<00:02:22.880> that's<00:02:23.060> basically<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.540> for

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
in fact anyways that's basically it for

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.009 
in fact anyways that's basically it for
this<00:02:23.840> seed<00:02:24.290> let's<00:02:25.220> go<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.489> second<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:29.019> now

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
this seed let's go to the second one now

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.509 
this seed let's go to the second one now
there<00:02:30.290> wasn't<00:02:30.500> really<00:02:30.590> any<00:02:30.799> need<00:02:31.129> for

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
there wasn't really any need for

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.800 
there wasn't really any need for
coordinates<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.239> because<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.510> spawned

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
coordinates there because you spawned

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.509 
coordinates there because you spawned
right<00:02:32.930> next<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:33.769> come<00:02:34.160> over<00:02:34.370> here

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
right next to it but come over here

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.740 
right next to it but come over here
actually<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.269> don't<00:02:35.299> really<00:02:35.510> mean

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
actually this one you don't really mean

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.729 
actually this one you don't really mean
coordinates<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.730> got<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> nice<00:02:37.970> little

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
coordinates was to got a nice little

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.839 
coordinates was to got a nice little
lava<00:02:39.739> area<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.190> I'm<00:02:40.250> not<00:02:40.400> sure<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.760> might

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
lava area and I'm not sure there might

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.849 
lava area and I'm not sure there might
be<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.030> spawner<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.019> area<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.530> don't<00:02:42.739> have

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
be a spawner on this area I don't have

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.289 
be a spawner on this area I don't have
it<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.069> but<00:02:43.280> when<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.430> did<00:02:43.549> have<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.880> sound<00:02:44.120> on

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
it on but when I did have the sound on

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.590 
it on but when I did have the sound on
ah<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:46.340> sound<00:02:46.609> like<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.760> heard<00:02:46.970> like<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.180> lot<00:02:47.420> of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
ah it sound like I heard like a lot of

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.580 
ah it sound like I heard like a lot of
like<00:02:48.049> noises<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:50.030> monster<00:02:50.420> noises<00:02:50.540> all<00:02:51.109> just

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
like noises like monster noises all just

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.690 
like noises like monster noises all just
wondering<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:51.889> that<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.160> couldn't<00:02:52.400> go<00:02:52.459> up<00:02:52.579> for

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
wondering what that I couldn't go up for

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.150 
wondering what that I couldn't go up for
a<00:02:52.760> second<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.170> there<00:02:54.290> might<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.590> spawner<00:02:54.980> on

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
a second so there might be a spawner on

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.530 
a second so there might be a spawner on
this<00:02:55.280> island<00:02:55.519> somewhere<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.269> going<00:02:56.450> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
this island somewhere I'm not going to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.150 
this island somewhere I'm not going to
put<00:02:56.690> one<00:02:56.989> hundred<00:02:57.319> percent<00:02:57.349> sure<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.980> just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
put one hundred percent sure it just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.729 
put one hundred percent sure it just
might<00:02:58.310> be<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> cave<00:02:59.200> check<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.380> see<00:03:00.500> what<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
might be a cave check and see what the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.659 
might be a cave check and see what the
hell's<00:03:00.889> in<00:03:01.040> here<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.880> got<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:06.109> apples<00:03:06.669> one

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
good because I like on the previous

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.400 
good because I like on the previous
island<00:03:15.489> there<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.669> no<00:03:16.930> trees<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.139> this<00:03:18.230> island

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
island there is no trees on this island

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.530 
island there is no trees on this island
if<00:03:18.739> there<00:03:18.889> are<00:03:19.090> actually<00:03:20.090> pretty<00:03:20.180> sure<00:03:20.419> there

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
if there are actually pretty sure there

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.589 
if there are actually pretty sure there
aren't<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.049> either<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.389> would

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
aren't on this one either so you would

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.930 
aren't on this one either so you would
have<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.410> ability<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.459> plant<00:03:25.669> your<00:03:25.760> own

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
have a the ability to plant your own

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.550 
have a the ability to plant your own
trees<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.389> here<00:03:26.599> which<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:26.900> think<00:03:27.049> this

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
trees on here which is I think this

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.500 
trees on here which is I think this
seeds<00:03:27.829> perfect<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.150> perfect

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
seeds perfect like one of the perfect

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.819 
seeds perfect like one of the perfect
Island<00:03:29.780> NPC<00:03:30.440> village<00:03:30.709> seeds<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.060> no

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
Island NPC village seeds just because no

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.430 
Island NPC village seeds just because no
trees<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:35.480> basically<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.049> plant<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
trees and you basically the plant the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.420 
trees and you basically the plant the
trees<00:03:36.680> where<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:36.889> hell<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.130> want<00:03:37.340> them

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
trees where the hell you want them

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.300 
trees where the hell you want them
anyways<00:03:38.470> that's<00:03:39.470> basically<00:03:39.919> it<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.099> this

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
anyways that's basically it for this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.449 
anyways that's basically it for this
seat<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.819> last<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.620> my<00:03:42.620> opinion<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
seat and the last one my opinion is the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.399 
seat and the last one my opinion is the
best<00:03:43.489> out<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:43.940> them<00:03:44.150> all<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.079> that<00:03:48.230> you

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
best out of them all this is that you

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.050 
best out of them all this is that you
don't<00:03:48.530> spawn<00:03:48.799> right<00:03:49.010> next<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.549> npc

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
don't spawn right next to the npc

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.780 
don't spawn right next to the npc
village<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.750> do<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.319> previous<00:03:52.010> ones

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
village like you do in the previous ones

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.520 
village like you do in the previous ones
the<00:03:53.090> fact<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.450> spawn<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:53.959> an<00:03:54.079> area<00:03:54.290> it's

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
the fact you spawn in an area it's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.119 
the fact you spawn in an area it's
basically<00:03:55.489> an<00:03:55.670> extreme<00:03:56.030> Hills<00:03:56.209> biomerieux

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
basically an extreme Hills biomerieux

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.059 
basically an extreme Hills biomerieux
got<00:03:58.129> some<00:03:58.280> pretty<00:03:58.459> awesome<00:03:59.590> formations<00:04:00.590> let's

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
got some pretty awesome formations let's

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.729 
got some pretty awesome formations let's
let<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.459> thing<00:04:01.670> form<00:04:02.709> not<00:04:03.709> form<00:04:03.950> on<00:04:04.129> load<00:04:05.739> if

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
let this thing form not form on load if

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.380 
let this thing form not form on load if
you're<00:04:07.310> wondering<00:04:07.400> what<00:04:07.700> texture<00:04:07.969> pack<00:04:08.209> i'm

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
you're wondering what texture pack i'm

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.399 
you're wondering what texture pack i'm
using<00:04:08.780> i'm<00:04:08.900> using<00:04:09.939> 1.5<00:04:10.939> flow<00:04:11.480> HD<00:04:11.989> or<00:04:12.140> something

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
using i'm using 1.5 flow HD or something

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.069 
using i'm using 1.5 flow HD or something
like<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:15.699> now<00:04:16.699> let's<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.209> believe<00:04:17.359> it's

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
like that now let's see I believe it's

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.150 
like that now let's see I believe it's
over<00:04:18.289> in<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:19.009> direction<00:04:20.919> actually<00:04:21.919> no<00:04:22.039> I'm

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
over in this direction actually no I'm

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.439 
over in this direction actually no I'm
almost<00:04:22.490> positive<00:04:22.759> it's<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.210> this<00:04:23.300> direction

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
almost positive it's in this direction

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.730 
almost positive it's in this direction
all<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.810> think<00:04:23.990> about<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.289> because<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.530> remember

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
all I think about it because I remember
