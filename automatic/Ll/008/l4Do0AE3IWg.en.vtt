the masses and they don't care what the

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.950 
the masses and they don't care what the
table<00:01:55.850> looks<00:01:56.000> like<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:56.210> where<00:01:56.420> were<00:01:56.689> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
table looks like so where were the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.469

players<00:01:57.200> don't<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.770> seem<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.479> very

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
players don't really seem to be very

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.899 
players don't really seem to be very
important<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.579> manufacturers<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.789> that's

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
important to manufacturers and that's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.899 
important to manufacturers and that's
because<00:02:02.210> we're<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.780> tenth<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.890> their<00:02:04.310> income

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909

it's a small small small small rate

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
it's a small small small small rate
let's<00:02:13.610> put<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:13.880> way<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.180> already<00:02:14.390> know

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
let's put it this way I already know

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.479 
let's put it this way I already know
that<00:02:14.690> Brunswick<00:02:15.470> sells<00:02:15.769> twelve<00:02:16.220> million

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
that Brunswick sells twelve million

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.000 
that Brunswick sells twelve million
dollars<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> year<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.330> shoes<00:02:17.750> well<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.830> there

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
dollars a year in shoes well in there

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.890 
dollars a year in shoes well in there
and<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:19.580> what<00:02:19.700> they<00:02:19.790> sell<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.330> tables<00:02:20.750> is

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and then what they sell in tables is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.210 
and then what they sell in tables is
less<00:02:21.110> than<00:02:21.319> two<00:02:21.440> million<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.010> really

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
less than two million here so you really

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.860 
less than two million here so you really
can't<00:02:25.430> blame<00:02:25.549> them<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.819> trying<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.269> cut<00:02:26.630> back

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
