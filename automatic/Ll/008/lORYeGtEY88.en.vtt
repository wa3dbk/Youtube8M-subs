00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.820 
we had a little bit of a fire with one
of<00:01:54.100> them<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.479> not<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.110> be<00:01:56.229> out<00:01:56.470> for

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
of them so it's not going to be out for

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.999 
of them so it's not going to be out for
a<00:01:56.890> little<00:01:57.009> bit<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:58.470> statement<00:01:59.470> products<00:01:59.800> are

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
a little bit but statement products are

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
a little bit but statement products are
being<00:02:00.220> worked<00:02:00.520> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
being worked on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
being worked on
and<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:02.010> anticipate<00:02:02.430> releasing<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.780> least<00:02:03.960> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and we anticipate releasing at least one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.450 
and we anticipate releasing at least one
of<00:02:04.320> them<00:02:04.409> before<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> end<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> year

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
of them before the end of the year

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.380 
of them before the end of the year
statement<00:02:06.450> products<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:07.020> an<00:02:07.260> amp<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> deck

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
statement products are an amp and a deck

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
statement products are an amp and a deck
the<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.899> separate<00:02:10.289> products<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> amp<00:02:11.130> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the two separate products the amp I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.850 
the two separate products the amp I
think<00:02:12.000> people<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.990> bit<00:02:13.200> about<00:02:13.440> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
think people know a little bit about one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
think people know a little bit about one
is<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.459> an<00:02:14.700> integrated<00:02:15.240> amp<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.780> will

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is that it's an integrated amp that will

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.230 
is that it's an integrated amp that will
drive<00:02:16.170> speakers<00:02:16.740> headphones<00:02:17.240> headphones

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
drive speakers headphones headphones

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.680

know<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.750> neat<00:02:24.900> product<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
know it's a really neat product the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.190 
know it's a really neat product the
thing<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.780> microprocessor<00:02:27.780> control

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
thing is that microprocessor control

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
thing is that microprocessor control
system<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.940> still<00:02:29.940> under<00:02:30.180> development<00:02:30.330> so

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
system is still under development so

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.590 
system is still under development so
anyway<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
anyway that's the that's the one that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.300 
anyway that's the that's the one that
kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> had<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> little<00:02:34.110> bit<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.470> fire<00:02:34.739> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
kind of had a little bit of a fire and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.830 
kind of had a little bit of a fire and
then<00:02:35.489> there's<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.790> statement<00:02:36.030> DAC<00:02:36.360> that's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
then there's a statement DAC that's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800 
then there's a statement DAC that's
coming<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.810> we're

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
coming out and that one is we're

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720 
coming out and that one is we're
currently<00:02:40.170> evaluating<00:02:40.770> three<00:02:41.310> different

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
currently evaluating three different

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.949 
currently evaluating three different
analog<00:02:42.120> sections<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> analog<00:02:43.980> deck<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
analog sections for it analog deck and

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.600 
analog sections for it analog deck and
essentially<00:02:45.959> summing<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.070> know<00:02:47.130> sections

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
essentially summing you know sections

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.020 
essentially summing you know sections
for<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.390> I'm<00:02:49.170> hoping<00:02:49.770> that'll<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.640> by

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
for it and I'm hoping that'll be out by

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.660 
for it and I'm hoping that'll be out by
the<00:02:51.090> end<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> year<00:02:51.630> we'll<00:02:51.930> see<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
the end of the year we'll see but I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.860 
the end of the year we'll see but I
wanted<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.300> wanted<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.840> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
wanted to have here I wanted to have a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.229 
wanted to have here I wanted to have a
really<00:02:55.230> ugly<00:02:55.350> prototype<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.250> hide<00:02:56.459> under<00:02:56.850> you

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
really ugly prototype to hide under you

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.710 
really ugly prototype to hide under you
know<00:02:57.330> under<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:58.100> tables<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.610> didn't<00:03:00.600> make

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
know under the tables but it didn't make

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
know under the tables but it didn't make
it<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.590> working<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.190> guys<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.670> you
