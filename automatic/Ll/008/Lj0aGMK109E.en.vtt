00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.240
 today's market is full and 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.590
 entry level camcorders 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.290
 which have microphone input on 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 posts of tasks such as she is quite 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.320
 Fits but how to be and in that case 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.339
 when the sound source is far from 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.319
 camcorders 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.769
 let's say they want to write down a person 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.329
 which walk but where 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.310
 that far on nature the court tells 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.699
 but of course it's good when you eat 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.539
 microphone input it means you can stick 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.160
 one mic 1 loop but what about 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.029
 if there is no microphone input 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.769
 then the simplest will come to the rescue 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.629
 they have all the things that everyone has 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.750
 man you are watching now i will be afraid 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 move all the camcorder and yet me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.650
 you will hear the finish kabule expanse 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 but only the lake under the path 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.730
 in the park lumpy I can even a little bit from 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.870
 World Cup wins and will not be 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.850
 and in the conventional casket opened 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.310
 just enough to have on hand 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.050
 beat the phone that record 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.720
 sound 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.850
 but let's say gildeev n voice recorder all that 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.680
 you need to connect a microphone 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.960
 like a voice recorder 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600
 and then we are assembling shift 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.740
 sound and video result will be in 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.490
 principle, of course, not bad quality 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.510
 the sound has become much better nevertheless 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.070
 some of the simple cases are 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.100
 no such feeling can 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.840
 the percentage of poets focus is not new 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.990
 often used as amateurs and for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.640
 abroad this way you can see and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.040
 in other ways 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 and here they say oooh after many in this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.080
 I guess and I want this 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.470
 focus them open 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 all that is needed for this and so 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.030
 rocket klitschko which is worth a huge pillar 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.620
 one hundred fifty maximum 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.110
 but we will discuss it as an unusual voice recorder 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.900
 after which it can replace and mobile 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 phone 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.450
 this is for sure fortunately the bush is still there 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.180
 time for journalist lovers 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.470
 computer connection if u 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 him files 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.100
 loaded on besides voice recorder 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 this is the download 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.969
 even open your sound forge file 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.809
 we adapt the SBU a little bit because we have 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.459
 teachers rewound 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.249
 for this we will do 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.459
 to normalize 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.119
 then reduced 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.589
 NDU volume at least 60 dB 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.689
 here in Moscow 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.479
 last day nurse 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.759
 and that's what we did 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.009
 kWh 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.229
 serdyukov 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.940
 so we shifted the sound 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.379
 and picture 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.499
 but its what we did 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.279
 today's market is full before 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.919
 cameras start 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.669
 further I am in full swing afraid of the area
