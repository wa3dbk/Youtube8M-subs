00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
just make sure my little arrow is inside

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
just make sure my little arrow is inside
this<00:01:23.729> layer<00:01:23.939> group<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.020> we'll<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> set

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
this layer group and now we'll be set

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.399 
this layer group and now we'll be set
and<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:28.380> arrow<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:29.400> maintain<00:01:29.610> its

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and so the my arrow will maintain its

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.069 
and so the my arrow will maintain its
relationship<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.369> footer<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.869> follow<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
relationship to the footer and follow it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.200 
relationship to the footer and follow it
as<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.680> footer<00:01:34.890> moves<00:01:35.400> around<00:01:35.610> even<00:01:36.090> though

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
as the footer moves around even though

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.039 
as the footer moves around even though
it<00:01:36.420> itself<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.259> outside<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.840> boundary<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it itself is outside the boundary of the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.889 
it itself is outside the boundary of the
floor<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.619> let's<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.070> ahead<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.899> build

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
floor so let's just go ahead and build

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.340 
floor so let's just go ahead and build
this

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.720 

which<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.470> greatest<00:01:49.800> an<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> document<00:01:50.460> all

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
which I greatest an to document all

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.640 
which I greatest an to document all
right<00:01:50.970> let's<00:01:52.250> build<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:55.290> comes<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
right let's build it it comes to the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:05.780 
right let's build it it comes to the
browser<00:02:02.720> we<00:02:03.720> are<00:02:03.870> done<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.370> go<00:02:05.400> I
