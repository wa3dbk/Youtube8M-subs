your surface so that as your die-cutting
the<00:00:15.089> machine<00:00:15.480> doesn't<00:00:15.750> wiggle<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:17.010> handle<00:00:17.190> is

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the machine doesn't wiggle the handle is

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.750 
the machine doesn't wiggle the handle is
very<00:00:18.080> easy<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.320> move<00:00:19.500> through<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.730> has

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
very easy to move through and it has

using a variety of other dies other than

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
using a variety of other dies other than
the<00:00:35.040> Spellbinders<00:00:35.670> dies<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.780> Spellbinders

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the Spellbinders dies now Spellbinders

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.100 
the Spellbinders dies now Spellbinders
is<00:00:37.590> known<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.250> their<00:00:38.640> nesting<00:00:39.180> dies<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:39.930> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is known for their nesting dies they can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.799 
is known for their nesting dies they can
be<00:00:40.230> used<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.520> nested<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.570> can

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
be used like they are nested or you can

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
be used like they are nested or you can
be<00:00:42.870> used<00:00:43.020> individually<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
be used individually so you're going to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.080 
be used individually so you're going to
start<00:00:44.760> off<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.000> using<00:00:45.390> plate<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.640> place<00:00:47.640> your

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
start off by using plate a place your

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.290 
start off by using plate a place your
die<00:00:48.420> down<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.230> these<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.340> low-profile<00:00:51.030> dies

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
die down and these are low-profile dies

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
die down and these are low-profile dies
so<00:00:51.539> you'll<00:00:51.660> notice<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so you'll notice that they just have the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
so you'll notice that they just have the
cutting<00:00:53.489> blade<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> dive<00:00:54.750> place

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
cutting blade right on the dive place

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500

your paper on top of it and I am going
to<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:57.960> fun<00:00:58.199> show<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:58.739> these

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to just for fun show you how these

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
to just for fun show you how these
nesting<00:00:59.399> dies<00:00:59.579> work<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> put<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.170> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
nesting dies work and put one right in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
nesting dies work and put one right in
the<00:01:01.440> middle<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.039> we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the middle so we're going to get a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
the middle so we're going to get a
double<00:01:02.850> window<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.650> once<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
double window here once I have it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.030 
double window here once I have it
positioned<00:01:05.549> put<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.390> paper<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.860> my

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
positioned put my paper on top put my

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.730 
positioned put my paper on top put my
cutting<00:01:08.280> plate<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> once<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
cutting plate on top so once you have it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.230 
cutting plate on top so once you have it
the<00:01:11.040> sandwich<00:01:11.400> built<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> load

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the sandwich built you're going to load

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.380 
the sandwich built you're going to load
it<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.900> machine<00:01:13.880> crank<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.240> through

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.030 

once<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> started<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> top

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
once it started you can use the top

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.649 
once it started you can use the top
handles<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> brace<00:01:24.420> the

fit<00:01:54.840> nicely<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.470> plate<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
fit nicely on this plate you do have a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.550 
fit nicely on this plate you do have a
lot<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.000> work<00:01:57.329> space<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.200> arrange

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
lot of work space so you can arrange

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.760 
lot of work space so you can arrange
multiple<00:01:58.860> dies<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> want<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.380> are

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
multiple dies if you want if you are

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
multiple dies if you want if you are
using<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.250> half<00:02:02.369> by<00:02:02.549> 11<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.360> need<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> trim

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
using a half by 11 you do need to trim
