00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 to put you to work 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.220
 properly if not then you'll have 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.080
 losses and you will not know where you ended up 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.040
 money is the only thing I do not like this 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.130
 type of applications 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.300
 but we also find wilber 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.620
 plus is going to be an application to call 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.520
 to counting favorite contacts by 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.890
 call it somehow but from your 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.450
 passion was a man from the center of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.960
 notifications that's not the control 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.060
 center 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.300
 if from your notification center ok 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.150
 you simply drag and you will be able to 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.860
 call your most recent contacts or 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.410
 You can know the application and it will give you 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.180
 a little more details 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.370
 the only thing that makes me father of this 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.260
 application is to be able to talk to you from here 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.600
 ok them from your notification center 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 because you have in case you want 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.670
 open the application you have to search for 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.740
 your contact and others would be like having your 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.660
 normal application or simply 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.230
 activate it in case your contact seeks you and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.269
 ready 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.760
 but this is what we say 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.700
 it makes good and interesting we can also 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.330

 it also serves as a scanner that is 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.709
 quite father ok I always told you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.980

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.799
 Reader of these for your iphone ipod 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.379
 touch or ipad you never know when 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.989
 you may need to find a killer 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.470
 contacts another application to call 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.780
 contacts nothing more than this they say that they 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.500
 characterized by being an interface 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 pretty smart in third state you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.319
 I repeat this kind of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.480
 applications it makes me like that 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.249
 It is the same as the one we have in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.769
 the iphone comes out only they change the one 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.480
 bit interface is at least 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.109
 I do not do anything functional 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.159
 it just gives you a new design gives you 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:23.280
 a new touch there but it is 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.400
 we found exactly the same 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.219
 heathrow car game but you have to 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 go forward as fast as possible 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:36.329
 graphics challenges but very very very addictive 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.900
 very good take advantage is completely 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:43.079

 to leiser pong that is this good is going to be 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.230
 a retro game is going to be a game of 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.150
 very basic retro you can see that what 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.819
 you have to do is not to let you 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.909
 go the little ball is but really 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.040
 it's pretty pretty father games 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.439
 retro that I have told you for a 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.939
 are very fashionable but not 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.730
 you have to abuse them so much because 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.159
 then it becomes quite boring and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.330
 finally we find beige under 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.130

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.960
 of descends the ancient tower of ships 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.420

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.010
 everything put in front go past 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.890
 pretty good the game but we came back 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.080
 the same thing comes to its retro interface and 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.780
 they start to abuse a lot of this kind of 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.480
 games and in the long run it can be quite 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.490
 boring and tedious to see the same graph 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.990
