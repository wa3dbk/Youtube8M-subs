00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
weren't that organized and it's the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
weren't that organized and it's the
market<00:01:03.449> research<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.110> didn't<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.250> too

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
market research just didn't it was too

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
market research just didn't it was too
costly<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.880> build<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.830> too

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
costly to build them it is too

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.060

as bad I saw we got warm beer cuz of
Lucas<00:02:12.670> refrigeration<00:02:13.569> they<00:02:13.720> say<00:02:13.930> sir<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
Lucas refrigeration they say sir and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.089 
Lucas refrigeration they say sir and
even<00:02:16.959> though<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.200> built<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.590> speed

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
even though it's built for speed

even though it's built for speed
be<00:02:18.670> careful<00:02:19.000> going<00:02:19.060> down<00:02:19.300> those<00:02:19.480> ramps<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
be careful going down those ramps the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.660 
be careful going down those ramps the
exhaust<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.160> very<00:02:21.459> low<00:02:21.700> they<00:02:22.690> were<00:02:22.750> designed

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
exhaust is very low they were designed

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.190 
exhaust is very low they were designed
badly<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.700> guess<00:02:25.030> because<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.480> was<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:25.900> low<00:02:26.080> if

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
badly I guess because it was so low if

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.309 
badly I guess because it was so low if
you<00:02:26.349> go<00:02:26.980> over<00:02:27.160> sort<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.150> bigger<00:02:28.629> bump<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
you go over sort of a bigger bump and

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.479 
you go over sort of a bigger bump and
usual<00:02:29.769> then<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.180> drag<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> exhaust<00:02:31.720> off<00:02:32.019> and

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
usual then you drag the exhaust off and

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.949 
usual then you drag the exhaust off and
so<00:02:33.489> yeah<00:02:33.910> they<00:02:34.090> weren't<00:02:34.269> weren't<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> have

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
so yeah they weren't weren't to have

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.890 
so yeah they weren't weren't to have
been<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.319> respect<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.910> 1967

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
buy them now I think even Japanese

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.300 
buy them now I think even Japanese
they're<00:03:00.790> very<00:03:01.030> popular<00:03:01.239> over<00:03:01.720> there<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:03.190> a
