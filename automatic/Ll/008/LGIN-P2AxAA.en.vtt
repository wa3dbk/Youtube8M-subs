neutral<00:00:15.630> spine<00:00:16.020> alignment<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.190> very

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
neutral spine alignment and it's very

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
neutral spine alignment and it's very
simple<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.970> tell<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.300> you're<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> neutral<00:00:18.840> spine

alignment the main thing you ought to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
alignment the main thing you ought to
look<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> where<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.109> ears<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.680> in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's when people stray away from that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's when people stray away from that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that they get neck injuries from muscle

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
that they get neck injuries from muscle
and<00:00:33.270> pigment<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> getting<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.920> spine<00:00:35.250> at

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and pigment and getting that spine at

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.729 
and pigment and getting that spine at
neutral<00:00:36.270> alignment<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> show

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
neutral alignment so we're going to show

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
neutral alignment so we're going to show
you<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:38.070> common<00:00:38.489> movements<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.969> people<00:00:39.300> do

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you too common movements that people do

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660 
you too common movements that people do
incorrectly<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.559> how<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> right

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
incorrectly and how to do them the right

first one you see all over the gym is a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.220 
first one you see all over the gym is a
lat<00:00:46.649> pulldown<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.180> people<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.809> they

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
lat pulldown and what people do is they

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
lat pulldown and what people do is they
pull<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> bar<00:00:49.829> behind<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.879> head<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.629> again

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
pull the bar behind the head so again

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
pull the bar behind the head so again
we're<00:00:52.020> always<00:00:52.199> trying<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> focus<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
we're always trying to focus on that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.029 
we're always trying to focus on that
neutral<00:00:53.789> spine<00:00:53.820> alignment<00:00:54.199> ears<00:00:55.199> lined<00:00:55.890> up

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
neutral spine alignment ears lined up

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.830 
neutral spine alignment ears lined up
right<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.550> shoulders<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.539> Lauren

right over the shoulders so as Lauren

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
right over the shoulders so as Lauren
does<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> incorrectly<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.760> look<00:00:59.910> from

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
does this incorrectly if you look from

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
does this incorrectly if you look from
the<00:01:00.210> side<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.410> her<00:01:01.559> ear<00:01:01.980> two

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the side you're going to see her ear two

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549 
the side you're going to see her ear two
inches<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.149> front<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.510> her<00:01:03.629> shoulder<00:01:04.019> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
inches in front of her shoulder what

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
inches in front of her shoulder what
that<00:01:04.710> does<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> increase<00:01:05.610> her<00:01:05.790> risk<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.180> injury

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that does is increase her risk of injury

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.990 
that does is increase her risk of injury
from<00:01:07.080> muscle<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.590> pinch<00:01:07.860> Minh<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.700> again

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
from muscle and pinch Minh so again

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
from muscle and pinch Minh so again
don't<00:01:09.750> pull<00:01:10.020> behind<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> head<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.950> you're

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
don't pull behind the head what you're

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
don't pull behind the head what you're

gonna do position that ear right over

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.330 
gonna do position that ear right over
the<00:01:13.110> shoulder<00:01:13.500> you're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> pull<00:01:14.130> right

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the shoulder you're going to pull right

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.010 
the shoulder you're going to pull right
down<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> front<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.900> were

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
down to the front just as if you were

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
down to the front just as if you were
doing<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> pull-up<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> chin<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
doing a pull-up or a chin up it's the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
doing a pull-up or a chin up it's the
same<00:01:18.540> exact<00:01:18.900> movement<00:01:19.350> occurring<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
same exact movement occurring at the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
same exact movement occurring at the
shoulder<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> neck<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
shoulder but now we have that neck in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
shoulder but now we have that neck in
that<00:01:22.170> neutral<00:01:22.409> spine<00:01:22.619> position<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> that's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that neutral spine position so that's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
that neutral spine position so that's
the<00:01:25.350> first<00:01:25.500> example<00:01:26.100> second<00:01:26.759> example<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the first example second example that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
the first example second example that
you<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> lot<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> people<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.280> an

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you see a lot of people do is they do an

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.240 
you see a lot of people do is they do an
overhead<00:01:29.850> press<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:31.170> overextend<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
overhead press and they overextend the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
overhead press and they overextend the
movement<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.780> Lauren's<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
movement so what Lauren's going to do is
