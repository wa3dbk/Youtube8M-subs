00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
but there's one video that also points

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.310 
but there's one video that also points
out<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.640> outdoor<00:02:32.940> baggage<00:02:33.900> hailing

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.190 
area is in the shape of a phallus let's
take<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> closer<00:02:37.830> look<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.989> photograph

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
take a closer look now this photograph

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.650 
take a closer look now this photograph
was<00:02:40.650> taken<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.130> snowy<00:02:41.550> day<00:02:41.880> which<00:02:42.330> makes

was taken on a snowy day which makes

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.310 
was taken on a snowy day which makes
this<00:02:42.930> area<00:02:43.280> actually<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.610> clearer<00:02:45.060> up

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
this area actually a little clearer up

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.310 
this area actually a little clearer up
here<00:02:46.320> we<00:02:46.470> see<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.890> testicle<00:02:47.700> area<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.540> then

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
here we see the testicle area and then

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.810 
here we see the testicle area and then
out<00:02:49.440> here<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> phallus

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
out here the phallus

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.330 
out here the phallus
there's<00:02:51.450> no<00:02:51.660> doubt<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.470> designers<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
there's no doubt that the designers of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.090 
there's no doubt that the designers of
this<00:02:53.519> Airport<00:02:54.209> had<00:02:54.810> something<00:02:55.230> other<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.769> mind

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
this Airport had something other in mind

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.170 
this Airport had something other in mind
than<00:02:56.519> making<00:02:56.760> an<00:02:57.030> efficient<00:02:57.720> baggage<00:02:58.200> area

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
than making an efficient baggage area

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.970 
than making an efficient baggage area

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
think you can see what they are getting

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.009 
think you can see what they are getting
it<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:05.670> course<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.090> Christians<00:03:06.600> we<00:03:06.750> need<00:03:06.930> to

it of course as Christians we need to

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.800 
it of course as Christians we need to
understand<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.489> phallic<00:03:08.880> symbol<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.540> a

powerful symbol and many pagan religions

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080 
powerful symbol and many pagan religions
worship<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> phallus<00:03:14.010> because<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:14.970> a
