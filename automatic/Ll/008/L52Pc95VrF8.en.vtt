00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.020
 five realms of biology in the field 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.610
 of the kingdom biology is each of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 large subdivisions in which 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.619
 consider living beings distributed 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 by reason of their common characters in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.220
 the present kingdom is the second level 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 of classification below the domain 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 queen coin 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.840
 the individuals belonging to the kingdom 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.550
 currency are prokaryotic organisms 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.800
 unicellular represented by 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 bacteria and blue-green algae 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.970
 they are characterized by the fact of not 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.050
 possess nuclear mitochondria membranes 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.430
 plastics or advanced flagella 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.530
 they generally eat 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.270
 by means of absorption but some 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.970
 specimens are able to perform 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.980
 mainly photosynthetic processes 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.500
 Your type of reproduction can be 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.450
 asexual by fission or by buds other 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.540
 way of reproduction will be through 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.700
 sexual proto phenomena within the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.680
 Kingdom currency can be found at 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.890
 individuals who are immobile and to whom 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.619
 they have the ability to move kingdom 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.360
 Buddhist the protest kingdom is 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.250
 conformed by a group of organisms 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.320
 they presented a set of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 characteristics that prevented placing them 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.030
 in the existing realms of a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.920
 fully defined way this should be 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.960
 that some protists can look like 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.360
 and act as individuals of the kingdom 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.460
 plants other protists may resemble 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.470
 and act as kingdom organisms 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 animal but the kingdom organisms 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.700
 protists 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.340
 neither animals nor plants are eukaryotes 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.159
 they do not form tissues 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 they are autotrophs by photosynthesis but 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.120
 other phosphor absorption or combination 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.280
 from both 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.880
 they are usually him or god but 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.740
 there are some exceptions 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.440
 they reproduce sexual means and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.540
 sexually mitosis 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.819
 are aquatic or develop in 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.170
 humid terrestrial environments 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.120
 subtle kingdom 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.030
 fungi are multicellular organisms 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.830
 that is, they can be unicellular or 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 flower and cell phones that feed 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.120
 by absorbing these vegetables there 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
 can synthesize their own food 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.440
 live on other organisms is why 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.110
 that are said to be sã profitós or 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 parasites and fungal lichens 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.860
 they are organisms without chlorophyll, so 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.319
 they can not perform the function of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 photosynthesis get their food in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.750
 Direct or indirect way storing 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.970
 the substances nutrients 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.010
 bodies of the fungi are formed by 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 some filaments called figures in the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.580
 that we can find the material 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.420
 organic where it grows called mycelium 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.610
 nutritious 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.920
 these are the so-called similar fungi 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.319
 to an umbrella because they raise in 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 the air hómez the reproductive I are 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.830
 motionless but with proto flow 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.049
 plasma in the mycelium the mycelia 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.269
 they are masses of branched filaments 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.190
 called daughters that make up the fungus 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.010
 its reproduction cycle is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.439
 Primarily sexual and asexual 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.480
 All fungi except for 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.510
 the imperfect fungi of uterus myths 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.760
 they have a sexual and asexual reproduction 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.640
 this reproduction occurs only in fungi 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.099
 Lower aquatic 5000 hedges exist 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.160
 harmful fungi and other very useful 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.410
 as the yeast plant kingdom 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.390
 the kingdom plants or vegetable comes to 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.670
 represent the most important link 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.710
 within any food chain the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.720
 most of them have chlorophyll and 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 can store the energy that comes 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.300
 of the sun and synthesize substances 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.850
 food are known more than 260,000 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.240
 species although this number is less than 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.800
 those that make up animal species 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.080
 it has tried to classify the 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.940
 plants in many ways but in this 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.010
 case we will present the simplest 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.950
 since they will not be taken into account in them 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.990
 the fossil groups will be made on 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.120
 study of these plants following their 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.280
 evolutionary line starting from the most 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.200
 primitives as represented by 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.310
 late nights until those that are more 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.030
 evolved ie the angiosperms 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.250
 animal Kingdom 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.989
 it is estimated that the animal kingdom can 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.780
 they belong about one million 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.880
 species because of this huge number it 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.250
 he has done a very thorough classification 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.710
 of all these specimens have been 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.000
 classified in sponges the aware 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.389
 have forums 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.100
 plant myths rotiferous nematodes 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.550
 mollusks annelid arthropods 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.770
 Echinoderms and cuttings are characterized 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.780
 for its capacity for locomotion by 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.700
 the absence of chlorophyll and wall in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.889
 its cells and its development 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.840
 embryo that goes through a phase of 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.640
 blas and determine a body plan 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.730
 fixed although many species can 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.530
 suffer subsequently metamorphosis the 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.660
 animals form a natural group 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.410
 closely related to fungi 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.410
 and the plants
