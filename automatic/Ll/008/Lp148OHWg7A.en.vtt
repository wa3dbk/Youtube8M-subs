00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
so as you saw in the video like my

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.850 
so as you saw in the video like my
vehicle<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.120> Canada<00:04:15.600> its<00:04:15.870> exposed<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
vehicle in Canada its exposed to

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.400 
vehicle in Canada its exposed to
multiple<00:04:17.430> weather<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.720> seals<00:04:18.959> everything

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
multiple weather so the seals everything

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.289 
multiple weather so the seals everything
else<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.980> rust<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.090> could

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
else just like the rust and like I could

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.850 
else just like the rust and like I could
have<00:04:21.390> screwed<00:04:21.600> around<00:04:21.780> pry<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.440> around<00:04:22.710> with

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
have screwed around pry it around with

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
chickens both at the same time use rear

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.670

axle<00:04:28.800> bearing<00:04:29.100> puller<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:30.290> boom<00:04:31.290> they<00:04:31.470> come

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
axle bearing puller and boom they come

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.260 
axle bearing puller and boom they come
out<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.950> seconds<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.580> first<00:04:32.760> one<00:04:33.000> did<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
out in seconds the first one did the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.400 
out in seconds the first one did the
first<00:04:33.480> one<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.840> little<00:04:33.960> tighter<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
first one was a little tighter the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.530 
first one was a little tighter the
second<00:04:34.710> one<00:04:34.830> came<00:04:34.980> out<00:04:35.160> easier<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.790> say<00:04:36.390> was

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
second one came out easier I say was

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.840 
second one came out easier I say was
putting<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> bearings<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.620> one<00:04:38.460> side<00:04:38.730> was

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
putting in the bearings the one side was

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.430 
putting in the bearings the one side was
a<00:04:38.880> lot<00:04:39.030> harder<00:04:39.270> than<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.540> other<00:04:39.660> anyways<00:04:40.200> it's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
a lot harder than the other anyways it's

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.930 
a lot harder than the other anyways it's
fucking<00:04:40.740> beer<00:04:40.920> time<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:41.460> round<00:04:41.670> blonde
