00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
d care playing good and I felt that they

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
but they didn't obviously fancy that as

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.250 
but they didn't obviously fancy that as
a<00:00:33.809> viable<00:00:34.140> tactic<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.610> feel<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.719> seems

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that Han much more comfortable at the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
that Han much more comfortable at the
moment<00:00:39.360> yeah<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> feel<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.200> though<00:00:40.230> hon<00:00:40.620> just
