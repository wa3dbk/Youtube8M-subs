00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
team add-on so we've got two new rules I

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.380 
team add-on so we've got two new rules I
need<00:00:27.500> from<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.710> previous<00:00:28.039> episode<00:00:28.390> basically

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
need from the previous episode basically

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.760 
need from the previous episode basically
if<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.539> lose<00:00:29.750> a<00:00:29.779> game<00:00:30.020> have<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.350> put<00:00:30.500> all<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.650> my

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
if I lose a game have to put all of my

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.130 
if I lose a game have to put all of my
team<00:00:31.010> into<00:00:31.190> a<00:00:31.250> random<00:00:31.580> generator<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.419> let

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
team into a random generator and let

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.200 
team into a random generator and let
select<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.739> player<00:00:34.100> that<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.309> have<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.789> discard

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
select a player that I have to discard

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.939 
select a player that I have to discard
so<00:00:35.510> if<00:00:35.660> Ronaldo<00:00:36.020> gets<00:00:36.199> picked<00:00:36.440> obviously<00:00:36.829> he

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
so if Ronaldo gets picked obviously he

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.529 
so if Ronaldo gets picked obviously he
don't<00:00:37.129> get<00:00:37.219> discarded<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.910> no<00:00:38.090> other<00:00:38.300> player

don't get discarded and no other player
gets<00:00:38.749> discarded<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:39.469> safe<00:00:40.039> like<00:00:40.399> cool

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
gets discarded but safe like cool

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.379 
nice little finesse shot there to put me
one<00:03:03.500> nil<00:03:03.709> up<00:03:03.859> in<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.280> semi-final<00:03:05.060> he's<00:03:05.209> on

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
one nil up in this semi-final he's on

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.059 
one nil up in this semi-final he's on
his<00:03:05.510> way<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.810> win<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.349> world<00:03:06.530> could<00:03:06.709> be<00:03:06.769> wins

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
his way to win this world could be wins

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.849 
his way to win this world could be wins
himself<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.549> penalty<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.530> maybe<00:03:09.530> there<00:03:09.709> should

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
himself a penalty and maybe there should

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.319 
himself a penalty and maybe there should
be<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> rule<00:03:10.129> if<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.400> miss<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.609> penalty<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.060> he

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
be a rule if I miss a penalty but he

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.839 
be a rule if I miss a penalty but he
puts<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.019> one<00:03:12.260> away<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:13.010> put<00:03:13.159> me<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.519> nil<00:03:13.730> up

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
puts that one away to put me to nil up

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.460 
puts that one away to put me to nil up
so<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.329> could<00:03:14.450> think<00:03:14.629> of<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.840> rule<00:03:15.049> or<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so if you could think of a rule or a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.319 
so if you could think of a rule or a
punishment<00:03:15.769> for<00:03:16.310> me<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.609> do<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.150> miss

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
punishment for me to do if I miss

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.490 
punishment for me to do if I miss
apparently<00:03:17.720> Ronaldo<00:03:18.139> let<00:03:18.260> me<00:03:18.349> know<00:03:18.409> in<00:03:18.470> the
