00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello techno cat friends in this 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 Occasion I bring you a room for our 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 huawei 510 this room is a run the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.860
 galaxy s 4 galaxy s 5 and a rumba 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 quite fluid even though the 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.989
 I tried but practically like three days 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.730
 four days or I think less and I 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.610
 I dare this video because it's a run 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.400
 I liked both the interface 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.240
 fluency and above all 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.130
 in the hour of the games was magnificent 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.830
 since I dare to make this video 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.990
 before the approximate that I always do 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.410
 five days is already a rule I revise 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.440
 but being one I liked a lot and I want 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 share them well first of all this is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.020
 Rom left me as you will see 241 megs of ram 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 and practically half the device 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.990
 also show us molds I will show that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990
 here in the notification bar 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:20.360
 from this appearance to kit kat but with 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.490
 the icons say galaxy s 475 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 apart that they are editable we can place 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.950
 most I want to talk about is that this rom is a 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.500
 round this 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:35.110
 a round this 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.110
 4.4 good and good with achieve 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.430
 this network works for 510 axis game and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.300
 300 as you will see here in the design model 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.940
 300 but my device is a 510 axis or 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.490
 be that developed works for both 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.120
 I want to clarify also that it is coming 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.610
 in the see what is being adjustments 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.060
 come sections from personal interface 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.460
 but in sections like you will see here like this 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.460
 they come as the delegate 13 4 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.840
 what are good here on this side and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.840
 what comes are applications 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.860
 I want to tell you also that this rom 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 it works so much on your camera 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.269
 against the back 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.569
 and the camera is a camera that is a 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.749
 camera that are in the roms this 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.180
 the old ham as you will see here we can 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:36.520
 press and change the part that they saw 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 make it different works correctly 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.850
 and I want to clarify friends who are in 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.819
 question of quality in the games I 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.249
 he liked it very much is very fluid 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.080
 well that's the little revision that 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:55.000
 I have about this room 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.460
 since to my taste it is a start 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.520
 that I liked quite a lot apart that all the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.900
 appearance of a galaxy is only now 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.450
 we explain are minimum characteristics 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.850
 of the device but that does not matter I know 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.400
 What an apparent galaxy as it also 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.140
 we have the vote animation in the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 start time of shutdown that which 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.200
 I'm going to start an hour to turn it off for 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.200
 let's see the installation 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 they recommended that prove as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.360
 If you like the appearance of 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.990
