mechanical<00:00:18.480> engineer<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
mechanical engineer this is what I

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.410 
mechanical engineer this is what I
learned<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.470> 14<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.269> then<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
learned from when I was 14 so then I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.820 
learned from when I was 14 so then I
start<00:00:25.970> buying<00:00:26.970> bikes<00:00:27.330> customizing<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
start buying bikes customizing them and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.179 
start buying bikes customizing them and
selling<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.990> day<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> call

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
selling them but one day I got a call

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.990 
selling them but one day I got a call
from<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.550> manager<00:00:33.000> Moni<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.460> they<00:00:35.460> asked<00:00:35.730> me

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
from your manager Moni and they asked me

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.549 
from your manager Moni and they asked me
if<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:36.899> interested<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.129> build<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.200> custom<00:00:40.200> bike

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
if I'm interested to build a custom bike

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.630 
if I'm interested to build a custom bike
which<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:40.980> based<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.670> Yamaha<00:00:42.360> v-max<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.640> need

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
which is based on Yamaha v-max I need

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
which is based on Yamaha v-max I need
really<00:00:45.180> quite<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> time<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.920> think

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
really quite a time to even to think

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
really quite a time to even to think
about<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:50.090> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
about to to make it because it was the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.540 
about to to make it because it was the
most<00:00:51.379> difficult<00:00:52.379> point<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.340> time

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
most difficult point was the time

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
most difficult point was the time
pressure<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.620> had<00:00:55.879> when<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> agreed<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
pressure I had when I agreed to do that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.950 
pressure I had when I agreed to do that
I<00:00:58.350> took<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:59.129> complete<00:00:59.579> day<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> walk<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I took a complete day to walk around the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.920 
I took a complete day to walk around the
bike<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> bike<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.660> see

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
bike and to look at the bike and to see

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
bike and to look at the bike and to see
what<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> bike

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what I would like to do with the bike

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
what I would like to do with the bike
you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> came<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> point<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you know so I came to a point where I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.609 
you know so I came to a point where I
said<00:01:07.979> ok<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> most<00:01:09.900> important<00:01:10.409> thing

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
said ok the most important thing

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219 
said ok the most important thing
building<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.340> custom<00:01:12.030> bike<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.540> based<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
building a custom bike which is based on

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.340 
building a custom bike which is based on
a<00:01:13.290> Remax<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.000> even<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> modified<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> bike

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
a Remax is even when I modified the bike

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.620 
a Remax is even when I modified the bike
totally<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.759> people<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> audience

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
totally the people and the audience

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.850 
totally the people and the audience
still<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.650> immediately<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
still have immediately to see that it is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.910 
still have immediately to see that it is
still<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> v-max<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
still a v-max but there are a lot of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
still a v-max but there are a lot of
possibilities<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.600> transform<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> modify

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
possibilities to transform and modify

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.319 
possibilities to transform and modify
the<00:01:28.320> bike<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:30.030> special

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the bike into something really special

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.760 
the bike into something really special
and<00:01:30.570> unique<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> crew<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.909> together<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and unique the crew I put together is

doing welding start like front fender
rear<00:01:52.170> fender<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.009> before<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.360> in

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
rear fender because before we do that in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.770 
rear fender because before we do that in
carbon-fiber<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:56.070> need<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:57.000> need<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.210> form

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
carbon-fiber we need a we need a form

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.289 
carbon-fiber we need a we need a form
and<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.680> form<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.159> made<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.820> sheet<00:02:00.119> metal

and that form is made out of sheet metal

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.330 
and that form is made out of sheet metal
I<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.680> first<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
I was one of the first to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.969 
I was one of the first to
building<00:02:04.149> bikes<00:02:04.390> ms<00:02:04.780> carbon<00:02:05.320> parts<00:02:05.799> and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
building bikes ms carbon parts and

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.400 
building bikes ms carbon parts and
carbon<00:02:06.310> block<00:02:06.640> components<00:02:07.390> because<00:02:08.080> carbon

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
carbon block components because carbon

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.570 
carbon block components because carbon
is<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.709> very<00:02:08.920> light<00:02:09.220> material<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:11.370> only<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
is a very light material and only on the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.199 
is a very light material and only on the
wheel<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.030> can<00:02:13.239> save<00:02:13.540> probably<00:02:14.610> 25<00:02:15.610> pounds

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
wheel you can save probably 25 pounds

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.360 
wheel you can save probably 25 pounds
using<00:02:16.830> carbon<00:02:17.830> fiber<00:02:17.860> wheels<00:02:19.709> all<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.769> ideas

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
using carbon fiber wheels all the ideas

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.890 
using carbon fiber wheels all the ideas
of<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.239> custom<00:02:22.569> bikes<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:23.200> coming<00:02:23.709> from<00:02:24.400> me

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
of the custom bikes are coming from me

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.550 
of the custom bikes are coming from me
sometimes<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.080> listen<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.739> someone<00:02:27.730> else<00:02:27.910> has<00:02:28.239> a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.880 
self-build wind very well for us you
know<00:02:43.690> except<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.310> fact<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:47.709> was

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
know except the fact that we are it was

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.210 
know except the fact that we are it was
very<00:02:48.099> hard<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:49.110> keep<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> time<00:02:50.500> frame<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.040> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
very hard to keep the time frame and to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.650 
very hard to keep the time frame and to
make<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.580> devil<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.709> big<00:02:53.980> challenge<00:02:54.549> was<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
make the devil the big challenge was to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.009 
make the devil the big challenge was to
build<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.959> EXO's<00:02:56.380> because<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.130> exhaust<00:02:58.120> was

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
build the EXO's because this exhaust was

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.690 
build the EXO's because this exhaust was
also<00:03:00.060> ceramic<00:03:01.060> coated<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.220> ceramic

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
also ceramic coated and the ceramic

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.059 
also ceramic coated and the ceramic
coating<00:03:03.730> process<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.930> Germany<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.590> it's

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
coating process here in Germany is it's

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.759 
coating process here in Germany is it's
taking<00:03:06.549> up<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.880> two<00:03:07.090> weeks<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.720> was<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.350> most

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
taking up to two weeks this was the most

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.800 
taking up to two weeks this was the most
difficult<00:03:08.980> thing<00:03:09.310> because<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.000> was<00:03:10.269> one<00:03:10.780> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
difficult thing because this was one of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.620 
difficult thing because this was one of
the<00:03:11.019> thing<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.829> make<00:03:12.100> at<00:03:12.310> last<00:03:12.670> because<00:03:13.600> we

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
the thing we we make at last because we

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
the thing we we make at last because we
want<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.959> have<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> bike<00:03:14.620> finished<00:03:15.100> with<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
want to have the bike finished with the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:26.100 
want to have the bike finished with the
rest<00:03:15.609> of<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.359> make<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> matching<00:03:17.280> axle

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.720 

you<00:03:27.110> know<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.410> most<00:03:27.590> important<00:03:28.160> thing<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.610> us

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
you know the most important thing for us

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.490 
you know the most important thing for us
was<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> build<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.540> bike<00:03:29.750> which<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.080> treated

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
was to build a bike which is treated

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.220 
was to build a bike which is treated
legally<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:31.450> Germany<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.480> know<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.900> was<00:03:33.080> our

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
legally in Germany you know that was our

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.290 
legally in Germany you know that was our
goal<00:03:33.530> or<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.100> was<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.520> goal<00:03:34.700> which<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.120> that

goal or that was the goal which is that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.320 
goal or that was the goal which is that
for<00:03:35.600> myself<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.470> v-max<00:03:37.010> actually<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.000> already

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
for myself the v-max actually is already

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.930 
for myself the v-max actually is already
a<00:03:38.660> stock<00:03:39.050> custom<00:03:39.560> bike<00:03:39.740> because<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.430> it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
a stock custom bike because it's it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.520 
a stock custom bike because it's it
stand<00:03:41.240> out<00:03:41.390> from<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.750> crowd<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.200> all<00:03:42.380> the

other bikes you know and so it's it's

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.440 
other bikes you know and so it's it's
really<00:03:47.990> hard<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:49.580> make<00:03:49.790> something<00:03:50.150> good

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
really hard to to make something good

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.980 
really hard to to make something good
even<00:03:50.810> better<00:03:50.990> but<00:03:51.770> that's<00:03:52.520> our<00:03:53.240> job<00:03:53.420> or<00:03:53.810> that's

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
even better but that's our job or that's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.390 
even better but that's our job or that's
my<00:03:54.170> job<00:03:54.440> since<00:03:54.590> more<00:03:54.920> than<00:03:54.950> twenty<00:03:55.370> years

my job since more than twenty years
professional<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.840> took<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> bike<00:03:57.770> apart

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
professional and I took the bike apart

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.810 
professional and I took the bike apart
and<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:59.030> just<00:03:59.920> optimized<00:04:00.920> one<00:04:01.370> or<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> other

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
and I just optimized one or the other

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.500 
and I just optimized one or the other
thing<00:04:02.150> which<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.540> think<00:04:03.400> matched<00:04:04.400> better<00:04:05.030> to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
thing which I think matched better to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.810 
thing which I think matched better to

the first time on the stage when I

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.110 
the first time on the stage when I
thought<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.380> other<00:04:36.500> two<00:04:36.710> bikes<00:04:36.980> on<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.910> air

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.150 
thought the other two bikes on the air
what<00:04:38.300> should<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.630> say<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.990> since<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.680> was<00:04:39.980> a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
what should I say it since it was a
