00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.410
 8 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.730
 It is good to make a rhythm in the center defense of Ace Suzuki Yusuke 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.210
 I have been practicing with the goal of continuing to win in offensive baseball 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210
 Minori Academy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 Defense force is increased by was carried out thorough basic training during the winter 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:35.610
 Incense teacher who increased central stability to protect the short Daito 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 It was equal prize 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.399
 The pitchers headed by ace Suzuki 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.100
 He is up again again 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.100
 Make a rhythm with the pitching you take to strike 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.710
 Then I will talk to Takahashi 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.920
 Especially about Suzuki you have anything to do with growth 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 As there is enough experience, it has been increasing by 9 since this winter 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.630
 Because I think that the change balls are even more than last year because there are cuts 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.130
 I wonder if you can talk 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 As the continuation is roughly 5 points of ceramics 5 after all 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 We are aiming for a batting line that can get 4.5 points 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.110
 Well just 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 A hit is a chance at the thing of the one that comes out 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.979
 Strike, including the mental part a place called say how much the subject as an issue 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.979
 We are striving to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.260
 We talk to Takeuchiren captain 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:48.230
 How is the campaign to see the spring competition 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.450
 So also it is ended up with passive when you play against a team on the rating than their own 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.800
 Because I get a mistake 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.800
 I think it is important not to be passive but to go ahead with a different win 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.550
 Say that they are that their goal is the absolute zero 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.920
 When you are so sunset because doing it the theme to raise that 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.920
 I think I can go to Koshien 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.130
 It has emerged as a force that has been efforts effort thinking on their own 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.530
 Toritani 9 minutes 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:25.459
 I believe in the people who worked hard together 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.459
 We aim for the first Koshien participation in US baseball 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.049
 I think the attack
