00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.130 
infrared go with an extra large in these
and<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.290> base<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.500> off<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.360> now<00:01:06.360> all

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
because what happens is it's almost like

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.230 
because what happens is it's almost like
a<00:01:38.790> gradient<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> gets<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.939> it's<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a gradient so it gets like it's got that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.230 
a gradient so it gets like it's got that
obsidian<00:01:42.630> blue<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> midsole<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
obsidian blue for a midsole and then it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
obsidian blue for a midsole and then it
gets<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.079> lighter<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.890> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
bet is probably Bay there's some

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.949 
bet is probably Bay there's some
Japanese<00:02:23.819> web<00:02:24.000> sites<00:02:24.239> out<00:02:24.450> there<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.690> may

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
Japanese web sites out there that may

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.630 
Japanese web sites out there that may
have<00:02:24.989> them<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.130> going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> little

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
have them but it's going to be a little

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
have them but it's going to be a little
bit<00:02:26.760> difficult<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.110> hands<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.470> them

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
bit difficult to get your hands on them

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
bit difficult to get your hands on them
communication<00:02:29.280> wise<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.000> whatnot<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.599> if

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
you work hard enough you'll probably be

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.040 
you work hard enough you'll probably be

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
get us a night presto ID which would be

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.370 
get us a night presto ID which would be
super<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.430> too<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.030> anyhow<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
super nice too so anyhow that's the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.890 
super nice too so anyhow that's the
video<00:02:55.650> arm<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:56.970> one<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.480> Olympic

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
video arm this is one of two Olympic

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.780 
video arm this is one of two Olympic
colorways<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.730> think

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
colorways that I know of and I think

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.850 
colorways that I know of and I think
this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.209> actually<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> better<00:03:00.840> colorway<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
this is actually the better colorway the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.559 
this is actually the better colorway the
other<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> like<00:03:02.940> an<00:03:03.060> American

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
other one is like a like an American

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.050 
other one is like a like an American
flag<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.959> red<00:03:04.349> way<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.739> blue<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
flag like red way and blue and the the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.600 
flag like red way and blue and the the
plastics<00:03:06.599> on<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> side<00:03:07.049> are<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.410> clear<00:03:07.799> so

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
plastics on the side are like clear so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610 
plastics on the side are like clear so
those<00:03:09.209> that's<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.720> little<00:03:09.959> bit<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.230> cheaper

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
those that's a little bit of a cheaper

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.130 
those that's a little bit of a cheaper
one<00:03:10.769> I'd<00:03:10.980> never<00:03:11.250> own<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.870> particular

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
one I'd never own those that particular

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.930 
one I'd never own those that particular
pair<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.040> still<00:03:14.370> think<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
pair and I still think this is the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.240 
pair and I still think this is the
better<00:03:15.120> pair<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.690> anyhow<00:03:16.560> that's<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.980> video

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
better pair so anyhow that's the video

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.009 
better pair so anyhow that's the video
