00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
were doing maintenance on the PSN so you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
were doing maintenance on the PSN so you
know<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> didn't<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.730> here

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

I'm just telling you that I Sony
probably<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.990> reason<00:02:42.200> why<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.620> taking<00:02:42.920> so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
probably the reason why it's taking so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.920 
probably the reason why it's taking so
long<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.520> they're<00:02:44.060> probably<00:02:44.390> trying<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
long is that they're probably trying to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.630 
long is that they're probably trying to
make<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> software<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.890> will<00:02:49.340> help

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
make a software that is this will help

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
maybe that was on all the information

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.660 
maybe that was on all the information
that<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.709> were<00:03:48.860> thinking<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.340> was<00:03:49.459> going<00:03:49.580> to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
that we were thinking I was going to

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.340 
that we were thinking I was going to
come<00:03:49.760> out<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.180> run<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.480> range<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.080> middle

come out and run a range of the middle
of<00:03:51.440> April<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.370> maybe<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.790> was<00:03:52.910> what<00:03:53.060> they

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
of April so maybe that was what they

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.800 
of April so maybe that was what they
were

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
were

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.770 
were
up<00:03:54.400> thinking<00:03:55.400> about<00:03:55.580> coming<00:03:55.849> out<00:03:55.910> with<00:03:56.120> but<00:03:56.540> I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
don't think they would came out I think

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.250 
don't think they would came out I think
they<00:03:58.220> came<00:03:58.640> out<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:58.849> modern<00:03:59.569> warfare<00:03:59.750> stuff
