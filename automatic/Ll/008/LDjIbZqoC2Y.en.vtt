00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:10.639
 and here folks here plus a preview of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 bills getting the stadium are january 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 Basque working here 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:28.789
 modeling and the contextualization 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 3d max work here is all here and 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.350
 for whom some waves some effects 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 also those united for example I created 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 here in no retouch in photoshop 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:53.539
 in fact most of the light maps 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.539
 of night mode 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.969
 I have them here in 3d max 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 after one worked on photoshop 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.080
 choose one of the parties in the area for 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:17.909
 other old work here and I use it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 blender that is your use of visualization 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:28.100
 of the textures are sharper here by 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 example of the bleachers 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:41.840
 if you notice that you can 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:44.880
 to see a straight step since max 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.890
 it's not that clear I do not know a little 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 blurred but here is the stadium 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.540
 I think it's practically 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.509
 more than 90% ready now has to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.979
 the part that will give a headache is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.629
 wrong is that there is in this area that part 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.160
 from outside the stadium 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.300
 are the buildings the house trees 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.150
 part of the Basque club that appears here 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.240
 which I think will give more pain 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240
 head 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.650
 click here 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.400
 cb that the effects of probe here are 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.900
 best here at max is how they look 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:41.180
 a game here these bars here could have 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 made in 3d plus the stadium became a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.800
 little heavy 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.080
 gives a lot of manpower 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.280
 I made it here as an image at the time of 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.670
 play practically does not realize that as 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.760
 an image even has a transparency 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.370
 You can not see here, I did not move. 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.990
 What can you tell me? 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.060
 transparency here but I do not 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.530
 I could because it's going to be too much work 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.930
 are a lot of free and then I'm kind of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.760
 delivered and will need it by interest 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:26.020
 let's hear the players will appear 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:28.490
 that I started from three stadiums 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:35.090
 practically non- commercial treatment 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:44.959
 I've edited everything so far that I 'm 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:48.530
 working with his time in 3d 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:53.060
 who from another video commented that about the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:59.540
 use of Aquino blend was better 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.500
 here is everything in 3d is cool at the time of 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 game 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.580
 here there is also a transparency that does not 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.880
 is appearing but there at the time of the game and 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.920
 There is a change around here that is one thing. 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:19.150
 like this 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.859
 michelin in texture is that the model in the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.370
 his ass 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:32.210
 This is it, I'll do it already. 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.340
 that's it folks i hope they are 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.710
 enjoying 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.389
 I think it's cool to 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:45.979
 damn it 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:50.840
 Megan is mini stadium and I'm going to start 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.610
 work as soon as you finish this in a 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.830
 Stadium 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.639
 I think it's cool, caramba 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:07.540
 We showed you photos, I told you I already separated 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:11.240
 so that I can work in the stadium that is 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.950
 the stadium of the Basque of the range 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.310
 I 'm finishing it's the stadium now. 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:27.610
 I'll start to like 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:32.630
 Southern Mines tiny orange 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:37.160
 the Basque or Basque the Basque in the head 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:48.169
 of hours and dictating old thinking and 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:49.669
 seeing that not everything is played in the team 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.080
 I was commenting to you in 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.270
 Basque stadium 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.640
 that part which is not part of the 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.039
 stadium itself but which is 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.130
 visible in the game you have to dictate 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.229
 to be nice and that's what I think 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.060
 that will give a lot of work in the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.889
 january 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.470
 This is how I was going to watch here. 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:19.000
 in the stadium of orange trees already full of 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.000
 nice details 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:34.050
 good staff is one more digit and 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:37.880
 basque range stadium of sÃ£o paulo 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:42.480
 I think it's cool! 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:45.060
 so almost over there is true 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:50.670
 I do not work at the table doing your 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:52.920
 back but I firmly hold that with 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.810
 a few more days of editing and I got 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:01.310
 Finish told everyone 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.310
 a hug
