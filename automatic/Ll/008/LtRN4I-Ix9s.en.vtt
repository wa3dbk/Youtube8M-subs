00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 yes Hello people in this video you see how you yours 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 Kinect for the Xbox can connect the 60 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.909
 and the rehab that went by 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.049
 have fun with the video so what cable do I need for which Xbox 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.069
 if you have the newest Xbox 3 60 then you certainly have life 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.679
 and then you only need the sensor 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.289
 and this basket 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.730
 this KP pieces then back to the kindergarten final 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.140
 but if you have an older Xbox 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.150
 like me here 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 you need if you the voter adapter back there off 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.600
 this extension cable with all the important add-on images 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 pure in the front 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.630
 and that needs 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.180
 This adapter was there and connection of Kinect legs 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.080
 This USB port was then inserted behind the Xbox 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 and the connection must be in the socket 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.300
 and how it works shows what we do with that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.780
 USB extension cable 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 when back here 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.590
 this adapter wants 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 not get into this connection here in the front 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.730
 that's too short for that 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
 This extension is included in the delivery 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.880
 that concludes then close that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 in Italy 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 that came parties 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980
 Nonsense adapter train 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 back in the back 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080
 Germany has the first step 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.910
 Next, the ranks have to hate location we Kinect spaces 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.400
 Sensor Finma 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.430
 I'll take it now 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 the place on the TV 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 The cable must hide, of course 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.539
 do not hide if he does 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.519
 want to see that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
 and then had this usb cable 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.929
 the export strength 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.199
 Norbu before 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.199
 Wieland's dick was in it 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.909
 and always is 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.539
 Plug this plug into the socket 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.539
 Stephanie Mold in the socket 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.339
 Quiet simply says Erkan Aktas is connected and it works 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.149
 if the diabetes and it would have done 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.579
 Of course she can return to the normal sport 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.849
 Of course, show what you can do with Kinect 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.709
 "First, I think 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.539
 then I come to Kinect 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.539
 and there I can 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.159
 with my hand 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
 the whole categories 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.299
 no animals for example 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.299
 which one does not work here 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.299
 that's it, too, with the Kinect here 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.079
 I liked it you're reading today and you
