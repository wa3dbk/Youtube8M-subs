00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
got understand that if that comes out we

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.500 
got understand that if that comes out we
make<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> content<00:02:07.970> right<00:02:08.090> away

you've<00:02:08.750> got<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.260> forwarding

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
you've got to have that forwarding

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.500 
you've got to have that forwarding
energy<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.040> return<00:02:10.399> where<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.729> at<00:02:10.880> okay

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
energy to return where it's at okay

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.360 
energy to return where it's at okay
so<00:02:11.930> Matt's<00:02:12.200> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.470> slowly<00:02:12.770> bring<00:02:13.070> on<00:02:13.250> the

jab and make a contact I follow it back

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.400 
jab and make a contact I follow it back
to<00:02:15.709> where<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.070> comes<00:02:16.280> in<00:02:16.900> jabs<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:18.080> always<00:02:18.380> a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
to where it comes in jabs are always a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.380 
to where it comes in jabs are always a

see<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.720> was<00:02:41.870> guilty<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.590> years

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
see and I was guilty of this for years

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.900 
see and I was guilty of this for years
the<00:02:43.760> time<00:02:44.000> saw<00:02:44.269> block<00:02:44.890> well<00:02:45.890> personally<00:02:46.400> this

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
the time saw block well personally this

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.300 
the time saw block well personally this
is<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.330> personal<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.989> don't<00:02:48.470> think<00:02:48.530> times<00:02:49.040> how

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
is just personal I don't think times how

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.949 
is just personal I don't think times how
off<00:02:49.519> there's<00:02:49.730> enough<00:02:49.940> structure<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.660> winding

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
off there's enough structure to winding

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.080 
off there's enough structure to winding
up<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.170> feeding<00:02:51.500> against<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.950> okay<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.850> it's

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
up the feeding against that okay so it's

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.550 
up the feeding against that okay so it's
going<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.330> based<00:02:53.570> off<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.810> distance

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
going to be based off of distance

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.860 
going to be based off of distance
honestly<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.220> Matt<00:02:55.430> comes<00:02:55.580> 0<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.940> 1/2<00:02:56.420> he

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
honestly if Matt comes 0 to 1/2 he

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.740 
honestly if Matt comes 0 to 1/2 he
punches<00:02:57.230> one<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:59.090> from<00:02:59.269> inside<00:02:59.390> of

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
punches one and into like from inside of

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.360 
punches one and into like from inside of
that<00:02:59.900> hopefully<00:03:00.440> that's<00:03:00.800> going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> be<00:03:01.130> enough

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
that hopefully that's going to be enough

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.100 
that hopefully that's going to be enough
so<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.269> keep<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.600> mind<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.989> it's

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
so you have to keep in mind that it's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.479 
so you have to keep in mind that it's
not<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.620> technique<00:03:04.010> they<00:03:04.160> were<00:03:04.280> winding

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
not just the technique they were winding

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.580 
not just the technique they were winding
up<00:03:04.640> doing<00:03:04.880> when<00:03:05.030> John<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.989> concept<00:03:06.440> behind

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
up doing when John it's a concept behind

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.090 
up doing when John it's a concept behind
it

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.949 
it
remember<00:03:07.550> Wing<00:03:07.730> Chun<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.060> forwarding<00:03:08.720> as

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
remember Wing Chun is a forwarding as

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.870 
remember Wing Chun is a forwarding as

in<00:03:10.970> there<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.780> matches<00:03:12.140> up<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.350> his<00:03:12.440> guard

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
in there so it matches up in his guard

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.340 
in there so it matches up in his guard
and<00:03:12.920> he<00:03:13.220> steps<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.550> with<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.700> punch<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.810> I'm
