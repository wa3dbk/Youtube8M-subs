00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
weather here is so soft

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.350 
weather here is so soft
my<00:01:07.850> first<00:01:08.390> touch<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:09.230> I<00:01:10.090> mean<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.240> obviously

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
my first touch is I mean you obviously

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.210 
my first touch is I mean you obviously
need<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.960> good<00:01:12.140> soccer<00:01:12.380> player<00:01:12.530> I've<00:01:12.830> got<00:01:13.010> first

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
need a good soccer player I've got first

edge but I play defense
um<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:17.020> think<00:01:18.020> touch<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.500> pretty<00:01:18.800> important<00:01:19.190> for

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
um I think touch is pretty important for

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.150 
um I think touch is pretty important for
the<00:01:19.430> offense<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:21.490> obviously<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.790> um<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:24.170> think

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
the offense so obviously and um I think

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.130 
the offense so obviously and um I think
my<00:01:25.280> touch<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.520> improved<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.960> obviously

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
my touch is improved so it obviously

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.210 
my touch is improved so it obviously
does<00:01:30.560> make<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> difference

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
does make a difference

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.630 
does make a difference

provide<00:03:19.769> much<00:03:20.160> better<00:03:20.190> traction<00:03:21.170> foot

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
provide much better traction foot

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.910 
provide much better traction foot
doesn't<00:03:22.410> slide<00:03:28.850> bladed<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.090> conical<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.110> think

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
doesn't slide bladed and conical I think

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650 
doesn't slide bladed and conical I think
that's<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:32.970> learned<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.300> term

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that's a just learned that term

recently or rectangular and circular as
I<00:03:36.870> used<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.140> say<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:38.360> like<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.510> traction<00:03:39.989> on

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
I used to say I like the traction on

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.199 
I used to say I like the traction on
these<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.500> feel<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.769> I'm<00:03:40.950> not<00:03:41.459> splitting<00:03:41.730> like

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
these I feel like I'm not splitting like

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.240 
these I feel like I'm not splitting like
when<00:03:42.390> I'm<00:03:42.480> shooting<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:43.230> making<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> off

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
giving someone a through ball you know

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
giving someone a through ball you know
these<00:03:49.940> criticize<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.390> um<00:03:54.739> order<00:03:55.739> half

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
these criticize I think um order half

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.539 
these criticize I think um order half
set<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.630> it'll<00:03:58.470> basically<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.130> quarter

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
set up and it'll basically be a quarter

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.550 
set up and it'll basically be a quarter
size<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.120> what<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.390> need<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.410> in

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
size up of what you need it's like in

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.530 
size up of what you need it's like in
between<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:02.400> half<00:04:03.269> size<00:04:03.570> up<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.010> normal<00:04:05.010> so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
between a half size up and normal so

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.310 
between a half size up and normal so
basically<00:04:06.540> quarter<00:04:07.110> size<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> mean<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:09.110> if<00:04:10.110> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
basically quarter size I mean so if you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.390 
basically quarter size I mean so if you
want<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.500> use<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.739> for<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> while<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.310> would

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
want to use this for a while I would

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.040 
want to use this for a while I would
just<00:04:11.549> order<00:04:11.700> half<00:04:12.000> size<00:04:12.209> up

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
just order half size up

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.540 
just order half size up
but<00:04:13.470> that's<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.740> me<00:04:13.950> I'm<00:04:14.160> not<00:04:14.310> sure<00:04:14.460> about
