like<00:06:17.440> saw<00:06:17.710> quad<00:06:18.070> yeah<00:06:18.820> basically<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:20.170> right

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
like saw quad yeah basically it right

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.190 
like saw quad yeah basically it right
arable<00:06:21.190> okay<00:06:21.490> so<00:06:21.550> either<00:06:22.510> they<00:06:22.810> got<00:06:22.990> some

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
arable okay so either they got some

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.250

really<00:06:23.350> optimistic<00:06:23.880> quadriplegics<00:06:24.880> yeah<00:06:25.260> but

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
really optimistic quadriplegics yeah but

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.200 
really optimistic quadriplegics yeah but
I<00:06:26.440> think<00:06:26.500> money<00:06:26.860> creates<00:06:27.190> also<00:06:27.580> stress<00:06:27.910> yeah
