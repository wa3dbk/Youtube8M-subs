00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 welcome Olga sister and that is not going to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.430
 present today today I bring a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.550
 dessert 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.310
 of fruits with gelatin then to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.310
 we need a handle that is 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.890
 peaches now that it's time 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.210
 mango tommy then I suit mango take 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.090
 a bathroom and I'm going to add it to my 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.500
 salad bowl 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.989
 and I also need 2 kiwis here they are 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.390
 the kiwis the kiwis is this fruit that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.850
 Now it's time sometimes not found 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.910
 but now yes teams then I'm going to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.220
 add all the piece 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.220
 and we integrate it and two bands 2 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 and heat this suits us very well, I think 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.960
 I think it's something we can do to him 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 to our children to the family to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.240
 impress them with something new every 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.960
 day here I have pieces of grape jelly 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.210
 and orange 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.070
 we can make the flavors that most 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 like your family to whom we can 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.570
 add to our flavors 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.570
 to give life to these fruits you will be 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 add other colors 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.180
 I look at my children for each box 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.070
 of gelatin the instructions ask for two 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.430
 cups of water but here we only add 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.170
 one so that the gelatin comes out very hard 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.270
 and you can depart you can do in 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.280
 chains if you're not going to do everything there 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.610
 if it is not very watery and it is not going to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.610
 get along 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.020
 and you have to take advantage of the fruits of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.940
 season as Olga sister said 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
 Now the mango season is like that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 that take advantage of eating all the mango that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.400
 can because when it's no longer time 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.040
 all those fruits get very expensive 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.320
 apart from that they are difficult to get 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.320
 I will also add sugar 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 not normal sugar can not also 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.580
 add splenda 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.970
 a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 and the juice of two oranges 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.700
 they are all summer season fruits 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.739
 So take each of these 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.409
 fruits as we said and each of them 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.329
 has its own benefits 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.459
 also there the handle provides you 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.170
 you enough vitamins that are 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.239
 useful for the proper development of your 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.859
 body so is the banana is another 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.290
 especially if you are over 40 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.389
 doctors recommend that you not eat 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.849
 at least one daily banana, since it 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.439
 is going to provide potassium and all that and 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.019
 How good to eat it in a more 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.579
 creative and pretty besides that is 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.290
 providing your body with all that 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.510
 needs to work well and now the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.049
 presentation look we already have the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.049
 presentation 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.810
 I think anyone would 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.569
 present that will be fine with him 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.370
 look not only the colors you feel the 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.170
 smell also the lemon combination 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.749
 with the orange and each of these 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.180
 fruit is feeling good tasty 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:42.849
 we can also add peppermint 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 chopped or just adornment here I'm going to 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.090
 add a mint leaf 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.990
 but we can also sting this 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.680
 peppermint to everything there if leaves of 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.810
 peppermint and it will taste very, very 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.760
 good and also that the peppermint 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.850
 truth is good for our health 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.800
 I hope that you home 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.170
 taken note of this recipe true since 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.690
 mango two kiwis two oranges but the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.220
 juice of the orange and two bananas and one 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.799
 lemon scoop that's all that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.320

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.540

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.210

 give to be able to present the cold 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.250
 when their children come from the school of 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.780
 the school comes sweating that no longer 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.810
 they endure the heat and receive them with 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.180

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.800
 look good with this part that is going to be 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.690
