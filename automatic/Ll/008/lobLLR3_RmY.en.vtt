00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.770
 and there was also a lot of controversy in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.010
 this past three with those figures 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.480
 friend something that has been inevitable 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.120
 compare it with figures like those of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.920
 skylanders or disney infinite and in this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.230
 occasion is nintendo who delves into 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.699
 this type of market that mixes the world 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.500
 of merchandising with the world of 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.960
 video games attention because nintendo 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.539
 wants to clearly differentiate its 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 figures friend of figures as I have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.060
 said sagas as skylanders or disney 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 infinite and because their reasons have 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.500
 were protagonists in the events of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.630
 nintendo of the past e3 I'm talking about 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 the figures friend attention because the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.879
 Lord King and feel 6000 of Nintendo 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 America has assured that friend 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.870
 new figures of nintendo will be 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 completely different from what we have 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 seen in skylanders and disney infinite and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.860
 since they can be used in many games 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.199
 different and that is that there are many 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 users who do not stop comparing 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.090
 figures friend of nintendo with the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 figures of skylanders or the characters 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 from disney infinite the friend is 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.970
 completely different from disney 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.550
 infinity and skylanders are for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 of the own phil 6000 is a platform 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.610
 different to the nfc figures reason why 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 which we have been able to use the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.080
 technology to build it in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.120
 gamepad their platforms are different 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.450
 you can use the super smash figures 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.880
 bros in other games like mario kart 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.100
 captain everything in mario starting today os is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 bully world so that 's the game 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 crossed between platforms that we are 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 trying to communicate it seems that nintendo 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.490
 he has great confidence in these figures 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.100
 friend something that many users have not 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 slow to qualify as the new room 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390
 nintendo rooms we'll see if 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.979
 really is a sacacuartos or if 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.680
 they really give us something totally 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.690
 novelty initially remember that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.420
 there will be 10 figures that will come to the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.130
 sale although it is to be confirmed what to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 a price that has not yet been 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.590
 announced the first title to support 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.590
 said figures will be the super smash bros
