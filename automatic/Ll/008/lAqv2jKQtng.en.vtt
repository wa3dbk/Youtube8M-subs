00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.989
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.910
 teach how to make volvanes of 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.460
 puff pastry for making the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.390
 classic volovanes we will need 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.339
 puff pastry egg to paint and that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.519
 take us a nice color in the 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:36.989
 some water oven and two short pasta 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.210
 of different sizes 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.010
 we have these this is the size 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.760
 that will mark 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.609
 the size of the gun bolus and this one is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.560
 which will mark the size of the 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.120
 inside of the volvÃ¡n 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.620
 good the process very simple 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.289
 we are simply going to extract 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.260
 always taking advantage of the maximum 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.079
 puff pastry we have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.150
 let's extract 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.050
 some strips 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.090
 the rounds 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.520
 and we are going to put in this baking tray 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 that we have already put a little bit of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.340
 waxed paper to prevent then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.020
 we can be removed for the moment 3 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 Perfect circumference of puff pastry 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 Now what we are going to do is take out 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.570
 other three with the same dimension we're going 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.570
 to perceive from this part 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.720
 then all these puff pastry leftovers 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.310
 we can reuse them perfectly 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 simply what we are going to do is going to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:43.540
 be look more or less the center 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.280
 and with the short pasta is smaller 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.909
 take out another part 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.909
 you see 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 pretty simple now 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 let's talk around 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 from the outside 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.200
 of the puff pastry we are going to paint with a little 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.200
 of water 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.710
 so that it sticks well 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.250
 these circumferences that we have done 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.250
 we have here 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.040
 if we are superimposing it 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.040
 as you see it is very very very simple 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.420
 then I was 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.030
 we can leave this excess here and go 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 to constitute the top of the bar and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.020
 then we want to present the bolus band 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.600
 once filled we want to cover it with 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.990
 this part left over then later to how 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.340
 finger ring 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 and we are going to do the same 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.970
 with these others the most orthodox way of 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.970
 doing it is in circumferences but it 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.550
 can do perfectly in squares 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 in rectangles forming chests like 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.250
 you 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.600
 you want 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.790
 we have to bear in mind that the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.940
 Puff pastry grows a little and you have to leave 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.140
 a separation between ones and others for 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 that then do not stick to us and now 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.100
 final point would simply be 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.810
 paint them with beaten egg 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.049
 so that it lasts take a nice color 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.049
 in the oven 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.790
 and now we'll go to the oven for a 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.950
 time of about 16 17 minutes until 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.830
 take the color or the gold that we 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.080
 we want and we will simply take it out 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.450
 we will remove the part that has gone up 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.280
 center and we will have them ready to 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.350
 fill in or to give it the utility that 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.260
 we want good we just took out of the 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.300
 oven volovanes you see the brightness so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.019
 great they have but that you 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.970
 I was commenting if you notice the part of what 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.430
 that was the base has grown all this 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.569
 part but it's hollow then with the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.709
 Help with a simple lace 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.709
 we are cutting 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.090
 and we extract and we would have all this 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.090
 fill hole 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.480
 and we would do the same 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:31.660
 with everyone we are giving with the lace 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.660
 and with the hand we simply take out 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.270
 and then we commented previously 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.210
 this would be the cap imagines that what 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.550
 fill with a cod brandade 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.890
 with some escargots with what we want and 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.200
 then we can put on one side the 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.280
 cover or cover it so that it is 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.969
 completely sealed 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.089
 and the beginning 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.750
 this would be the way to elaborate 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:02.560
 puff pastry banners ready to fill 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.560
 look
