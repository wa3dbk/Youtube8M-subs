00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.210 
I don't know how they pay people this
way<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.820> take<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.270> video<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
way but I would take a video of just the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.569 
way but I would take a video of just the
payment<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.439> entire<00:01:46.829> donation

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
payment not me and the entire donation

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
payment not me and the entire donation
process<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.619> prove<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
process so that way I can prove that I

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.149 
process so that way I can prove that I
gave<00:01:50.520> everything<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.659> received<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.590> charity

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
gave everything I received to charity

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
gave everything I received to charity
100%<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.439> wanted<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
100% of it so I really just wanted to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.530 
100% of it so I really just wanted to
ask<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> thought<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
ask you all what you thought of this

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.300 
ask you all what you thought of this
idea<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> should<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.619> through<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
idea if I should go through with it or

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
idea if I should go through with it or
not<00:01:59.490> because<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.750> commit<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> doing<00:02:01.350> this
