00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.960
 pilots his fishing close to two 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 weeks that I did with fashion and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.469
 especially since I've never done you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 I was raised from a certain 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.890
 moment when we reach a certain 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.449
 subscribers like the one that is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 the e3 but besides I want you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 thank you that I owe you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 comment on a video presentation 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 holding the chain what are you going there 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.180
 to do and where the other is what I'm going 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.980
 do today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.679
 other topics so already what will have a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 background gameplay and a little scrum 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 general remains special duty more than I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.440
 am another speaker on a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 shareholder in ouch its members on what 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 I have to do that with a plus and who 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.379
 date a little but we will say 20 months I 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.289
 think that since there you have to know 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.300
 that I spent the prestigious who had 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.050
 marked a prestige finally brief it's a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 gameplay that dates a little shawl collar 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.120
 precisely defeated why am I doing 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 a lot of general scrum that you have a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 machine just goes on this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.070
 swan conference the general interest 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.210
 that's really what they want and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 other public aid 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 I am often an anonymous declines to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 the union but if I called myself against 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.850
 general farmers because it's with a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 pretty much already know they have 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 accounting including with those of yesterday 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.240
 evening the fans of the greens no for me and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 so here I am often last 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 general for that now I was going to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.400

 the octg times the side almost before this 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.880
 chain just equally 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.370
 passionate Fota through by 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.510
