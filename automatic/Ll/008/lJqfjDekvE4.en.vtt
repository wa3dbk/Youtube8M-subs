00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
started first up we have the original

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.249 
started first up we have the original
spider<00:00:20.910> which<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> hundred<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.869> forty

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
spider which is a hundred and forty

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.800 
spider which is a hundred and forty
calories<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.130> piece<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.419> have<00:00:24.540> three

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
calories a piece so you can have three

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.130 
calories a piece so you can have three
of<00:00:24.899> them<00:00:25.079> because<00:00:25.710> three<00:00:25.919> times<00:00:25.950> 140<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.149> well

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
of them because three times 140 is well

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.479 
of them because three times 140 is well
let's<00:00:28.290> see<00:00:28.470> three<00:00:28.770> times<00:00:28.950> 150<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.320> 300<00:00:31.320> 450<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
let's see three times 150 is 300 450 and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.979 
let's see three times 150 is 300 450 and
then<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.669> subtract<00:00:33.090> 10<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.570> each<00:00:33.630> slider

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
then you subtract 10 for each slider

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.150 
then you subtract 10 for each slider
which<00:00:34.230> means<00:00:34.530> subtract<00:00:34.980> 30<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:35.430> 420<00:00:36.269> calories

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
which means subtract 30 so 420 calories

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
which means subtract 30 so 420 calories
420<00:00:38.160> calories<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:38.910> sliders<00:00:39.350> this<00:00:40.350> is
