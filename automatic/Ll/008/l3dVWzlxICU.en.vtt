00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone and welcome to the blog the bay speed-dating 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.470
 so today I showed you is so recommended tiberi which is from 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.409
 even to scratch his psp 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.539
 so the debris that gives it my lighter for them 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.300
 a senior has gone from an official official fall of the burst - so 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 unofficial of the team p 33 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.470
 once you have your memory stick matic 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.659
 and your pandora battery 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.299
 so how to create other clubs if I'm proud of the tutorial previously 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.480
 so once you have these two elements 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 take your psp 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 to make sure first 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 the planet is hypnotic 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 and then 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.230
 Pandora's box 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 so the psp is the prototype 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 we hear a little bit 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.790
 the man the diode 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.520
 mexico memory stick 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.360
 so to finish fast 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.890
 so we finished 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.320
 so the last three we do not concern ourselves so 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.580
 the first says 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.200
 these courses to install a lot missed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.490
 Oppressed cross to install time slot 300 weekday outings 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.620
 33 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.060
 so we will do 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.160
 and the train station 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
 these extractions were exchanged or not counting from the memory 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 magnetic stick so you have to scroll through everything is done automatically 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.590
 so it's not very heavy but you still need a tournament a minimum 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.120
 to cover himself 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 m 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.860
 here it is finished that tells you 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.059
 for these crosses to be honest explains boris eltsine 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.059
 the uncle 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.199
 m 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.539
 why do we press 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.539
 is that all 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.109
 our children the pandora battery 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.389
 to resume we resume door 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
 our normal homeland 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.249
 so he came back 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.249
 lÃ©vesque 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.009
 for really the game will automatically run 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.349
 if the default settings so we expect from them if you had was well 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.629
 sure 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.629
 note a little bit 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.399
 so I have to trust myself 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.759
 so the language in English 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.619
 default settings if 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.879
 they do not see us very much so I do not know if it's chu where 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.019
 it will do the same but all friends 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.310
 the six coupons economic crisis the cyclone requires it's still 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.479
 much more than when the couple 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.779
 a molding slightly 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.629
 finally short if you know the xmb the menu of your psp 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:28.809
 not at all 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.809
 It's finish 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:34.340
 m 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.189
 much changed m 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.240
 Angles 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.849
 French nico 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.620
 I feel French 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.729
 ultimate 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.939
 so promised the original 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.909
 they ask us to wait 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.949
 double blow their guilt 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.259
 but more than a cure day settings 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.960
 just like the nickname of his lands 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.969
 a lot with the automatic start 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.969
 after you see who 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.300
 the psp 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.069
 crazy 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.069
