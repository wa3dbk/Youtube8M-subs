 ingredients that can attack the skin 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 oil is a paste substance and to be 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 substance needs another substance 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 which can be similar to other oil 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 these only work on a skin like 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.140
 always the first oil I'll go 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:58.649
 using olive oil is due to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 their natural acids and vitamins 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.119

 this substance is an excellent 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.030
 anti-wrinkle treatment because it neutralizes 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.230

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.460
 let's apply 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.990
 if you wish you can apply a good 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:04.150
 amount of oil in a cotton and 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.150
 massage the skin with this cotton 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.090
 or you can do it in a more 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.310
 efficient and most effective application with

 hands 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.970
 massage for approximately four 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.090
 minutes after this time you will 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 need a wet towel 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.840
 warm water will massage the skin with 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.820
 the towel and this will open the pores 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.100
 allowing the oil to penetrate from a 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.430
 more efficient way 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:47.630
 after moving all the oil repeat the operation 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:52.520

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.520
 allowing for deeper cleaning 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:05.370
 after massaging well for approximately 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:11.150
 two minutes this time just remove the 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.150
 oil with a very moist and very hot towel
