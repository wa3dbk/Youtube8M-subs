what what 343 is doing so this is a step

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.640 
what what 343 is doing so this is a step

in that direction you get going boy

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.610 
in that direction you get going boy
casting<00:03:45.520> some<00:03:45.700> matches<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:47.050> start<00:03:47.320> setting

casting some matches you start setting

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.980 
casting some matches you start setting
up<00:03:47.680> spectator<00:03:48.190> mode<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.760> start<00:03:49.030> appeasing

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
know I think that's some indication that

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.610 
know I think that's some indication that
they<00:03:59.709> are<00:03:59.980> at<00:04:00.760> least<00:04:01.060> interested<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.870> doing

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
they are at least interested in doing

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.620 
they are at least interested in doing
that<00:04:02.740> long<00:04:02.980> term<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.580> that's<00:04:04.300> going<00:04:04.570> on

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
that long term so that's going on

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.420 
that long term so that's going on
