00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.810
 hello monsters games today in this 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.309
 I'm going to teach you how to be that video 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.480
 beautiful kitchen for your dolls 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.469
 monsters 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.470
 The materials we will use are 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:22.250
 four large sheets of cardboard I 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.720
 I suggest these colors a sheet of foami 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.419
 Gray 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.210
 glue or a pencil and scissors 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.519
 little 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.949
 we will also need other materials 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.600
 what will you see as you proceed 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.690
 the video 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.809
 so let's start 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.040
 ok for the refrigerator let's draw 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.590
 a coffin 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.880
 it's very easy to draw it we have to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.880
 make a cross 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.980
 of the first which this stick must be 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.500
 of 21 5 centimeters 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.079
 and then at 14 centimeters we make a 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 point and we take seven centimeters to 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.530
 one side and seven centimeters for the other 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.540
 and at the top of each one we get 3.5 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.840
 centimeters 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 as here 3.5 here and 3.5 here 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 also down 305 3.5 and we join and then 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 we are going to do 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.960
 let's make edges to the speaker of the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.390
 thickness of the rule now let's 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.939
 cut out all the corners of this 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 way but without going to remove any 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.610
 single piece to cut make a cut 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.950
 and then we should stay this way 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.860
 it may look like this now what we are going to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 to do is to fold all over the coffin 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.900
 we'll talk the corners they stayed like 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680
 I said let's talk these corners 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.020
 and they were to then paste all of that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.030
 way and that we stay like a coffin of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.210
 true 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.150
 ok once you do not have it so we can already 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.430
 adding shelves is very easy just one 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.530
 strip of cardboard and the glues 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.980
 now let's check that it matches 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.920
 well with the size of our person and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.750
 now we go is the same Paul but of a 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 cardboard of another color I suggest 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.020
 also of the transparent plastic that 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.810
 it comes in the beds of your dolls 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.120
 mentawai and we're going to make the tabs 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.069
 but on only one side so you do not 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.340
 wants this way now we're going to 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.590
 paste these tabs here like this with some 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.670
 like soybeans and a pearl to make it 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.770
 like the little hand to open it and he owes us 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.220
 stay this way 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.240
 ok we should stay this way 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.760
 if so, it can be opened and closed 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.030
 easily and the shelves is necessary 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.890
 put them to hold the door and that 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.810
 I do not know / 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.959
 in relation to a ritual 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.069
 ok for the stove I took a box and the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 ferrÃ© with purple cardboard 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.480
 but you have to verify that it agrees 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.099
 well with the size show with house it 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.810
 go a little low because to be more 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.050
 high 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.440
 in a lot of cardboard in a coffin that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.810
 will match copper wire well 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.060
 I put this on like a cloth and hand 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.670
 subject to whom I put as if 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.440
 they were considering a red I put 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.230
 these little balls now 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.780
 Now stick the one in front of the box and 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.390
 then take a cardboard rectangle 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.850
 big of another color and he's going to put it to 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.569
 who I follow so that it is like the table and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.300
 we will stay like this 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.180
 ok so we should stay 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.110
 let's cut out a rectangle of 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 small cardboard of black color and what 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.950
 let's paste here 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.989
 ok you should stay this way i 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.080
 I put some red flowers for her 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.970
 candela now here we are going to make a strip 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.129
 of paper and we will fly it to form 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.400
 a rectangle and we're just going to 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.530
 hit the field and this box so that 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.750
 it was like the laundry but you 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.889
 you can simply paste a square of 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.540
 cardboard and now this I did this 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.840
 bending a wire 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.560
 and I asked for some accounts and that's how I stay 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.400
 now let's cut out a strip of paper 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.889
 have the length of this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.219
 and the art of this in this way 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.430
 so you can paste it here and we're going 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.310
 to paste once we are left like this only remains 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.420
 put the legs as little beads and 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.650
 will be ready 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.470
 and so you must stay 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.870
