 I call Sande and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.099
 make these rules are called curves 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.500
 French and if you've seen some of my 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.990
 videos I use to make patterns 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.210
 of good clothes in fact for that are they are 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.789
 rules for dressmaker for fashion design 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.689
 and they serve to trace the curves in 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 our patterns for example the sleeves 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.620
 or the necks 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 Many people ask me how I know 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.730
 call in where where they get it because 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.580
 they have not seen them or can not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.230
 get them I buy them in stores 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.230
 large cloths where they also sell 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.090
 accessories for fashion designers or designers and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.860
 I have also bought this some other in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 large stationeries where they sell things 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.480
 for technical drawing and so on but if not 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.379
 get I'm going to teach you in this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.699
 video how to make a french rule 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.250
 just like these that will serve you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.600
 exactly for the same then yes 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 you want to know what we are going to teach you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.070
 with me I also teach how 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.970
 Well you need the cardboard it has to be 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.530
 resistant that does not bend easily 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.880
 Scotch tape 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.180
 spray mount or can be click 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.620
 cutter 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 Liquid silicone 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.980
 and the patterns to make your rules 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.720
 I'm going to leave the link so that 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.720
 download in the video description 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 I'm going to do this one here but you 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.759
 you can do either of the two if 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.250
 you choose to make this larger only 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.020
 print the letter size and go to the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
 stationery that takes you out in an extension 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.909
 or you can print it in two parts as 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 I did it, you paste the two leaves and 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.170
 you have the complete pattern 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.150
 if you get acrylic of this type what 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.680
 you have blank and in transparent it is 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.400
 easier the only thing you have to do 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.520
 is to transfer the shape of your rule and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.069
 cut it and your rule will be ready but if 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.190
 you do not get it easily 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.210
 then use cardboard let's cut 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.430
 two equal cardboard parts 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.180
 in which the whole form of 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180
 our rule 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.310
 then we are going to cut off the excess 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.310
 paper around our pattern 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.610
 and we're going to stick it to one of the pieces 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.610
 of cardboard 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.030
 this is the actual size of the rule 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.750
 now let's cut 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.150
 our rule take your time because the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.980
 Court has to be perfect 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.349
 once you cut it you will be left 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.390
 something like that and now we're going to hit it with 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.810
 liquid silicone in the other piece of 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.810
 paperboard 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.850
 press and wait for it to dry and go back to 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.850
 cut 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.340
 so that you have something like this now is 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.340
 double 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.689
 Take a piece of sandpaper and let's sand 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.700
 all the edges of our rule to 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.299
 make sure they are perfect and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.299
 well smooth 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.300
 Now let's seal the edges with 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.129
 Liquid silicone and see the cardboard 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.480
 has eyes in this part what 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.480
 we want is to seal the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.120
 press with your finger in this way to 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.040
 that silicon enters all 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.409
 holes 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.910
 and you will do the same in all around 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.740
 of your rule 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.740
 then cover the tape 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.340
 and cut the excess 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.860
 now let's put tape on the edges 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.860
 it's easier if you do it this way 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.250
 hitting well 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.250
 and double here 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.320
 you will do the same in all around 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.420
 of your rule 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.190
 once you finish you will have something left 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.760
 so the edges have to look good 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.760
 smooth 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.150
 and you're ready to make your 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.750
 patterns how can you see the line is left 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.750
 very clean 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.550
 The important thing about this rule is that you 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.550
 be sturdy that you can not bend 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.180
 and that's it 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.490
