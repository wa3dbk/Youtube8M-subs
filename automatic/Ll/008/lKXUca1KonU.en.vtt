I<00:03:12.840> started<00:03:13.200> making<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> electrical<00:03:14.100> device

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
I started making the electrical device

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.460 
I started making the electrical device
and<00:03:14.880> here's<00:03:15.330> me<00:03:15.510> making<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.020> electrical

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
and here's me making the electrical

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
and here's me making the electrical
device<00:03:16.770> once<00:03:17.100> i'm<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.459> key<00:03:17.640> i<00:03:17.820> en't<00:03:18.060> into

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
device once i'm in a key i en't into

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.050 
device once i'm in a key i en't into
this<00:03:18.450> room<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.830> there's<00:03:20.730> actually<00:03:20.850> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
this room here and there's actually a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.479 
this room here and there's actually a
part<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.660> room<00:03:21.930> which<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.220> see<00:03:23.250> is

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
part in this room which you can see is

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.770 
part in this room which you can see is
different<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> other<00:03:24.330> round<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.800> then

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
different to the other round and I then

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.560 
different to the other round and I then
open<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.900> dog<00:03:28.200> got<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:29.090> fit<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.300> onto<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
open this dog got out fit it onto the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.990 
open this dog got out fit it onto the
bus<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.739> time<00:03:32.070> round<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.670> show<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.910> with

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
bus and this time round to show it with

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.449 
bus and this time round to show it with
different<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.480> well<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.470> thought<00:03:35.400> of

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
different as well I actually thought of

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.990 
different as well I actually thought of
all<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> zombies<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.540> roof<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.220> he<00:03:38.730> Ramage

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
am just start working up some points and

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.210 
am just start working up some points and
then<00:04:34.570> here<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> enter<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.560> electrical<00:04:36.010> door

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
then here I enter the electrical door

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.590 
then here I enter the electrical door
and<00:04:36.810> once<00:04:37.810> again<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.260> prove<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:40.330> a

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
and once again to prove that it's a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.510 
and once again to prove that it's a
different<00:04:40.960> game<00:04:41.080> play<00:04:41.350> from<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.560> horn<00:04:41.920> and<00:04:42.160> I
