00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hi jp this time I will tire swing of Gashapon Kamen Rider Drive 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.969
 I will introduce 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 This is the guy I turned at the editing shop 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:20.490
 I say this Nakane in the fact that 8 all four 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.880
 The first time is max flare 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.279
 Certainly the second time 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:34.750
 Third time in this Kana second time I certainly roadway 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:43.150
 It is to feel a look at the pipe out to you Oh Did you mean complete with Panki 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 The fourth one is max flare ah ah oh what kind of after speed is type speed 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.680
 ua 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 The three other types speed this time by say jam and the public like a 8 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 The booklet I would like to introduce is 200 yen once with such feeling 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.220
 In line-up type speed tire Max flare Tire bread copy spike 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 tire 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.159
 Midnight Roadway Tires Complete 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:17.659
 There are 4 types , so it's a Mac flare that I 've set aside for the booklet 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 Oh, it's quite different from the color of this tire change at all during the play, isn't it? 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.659
 This is also N do or there now 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.159
 play 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.240
 This is 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:34.810
 Oh I have a mind, such as had been fixed to a retirement Gachigachi there was there a but 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.409
 If you go around a little, there are all this 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.750
 It's pretty hard, but I want to go around 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:48.159
 And it is thinner than the tires of this tire replacement series. 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.230
 Of course, the color is not clear, either, so it's better either 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.480
 It is a little pearl-ish beautiful color 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.650
 The letters after max touch are also printed in black. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.250
 Yup 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.840
 It looks ne ne also part of this aluminum is amazing good 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.380
 I have to say whether it properly Annan is between I'm cool this spoke 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 Of or stuck in bad Really cool this tri-drone 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 And the back side looks like this from the tire a little 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.380
 Parts are out and the ball chain ahead 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.440
 It is such feeling when hanging as a good holder because it is learned 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.790
 In guy in this is mapped twice 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.319
 Next 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.680
 Is this five? 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.680
 Often 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.670
 Go Anti-full ne This is also a pretty fine color 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.930
 It is a funky spiked tire and this is also black in the character and aluminum is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 Cool 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:50.900
 The size of the tire is too 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:54.799
 Or ish metallic house the zone something at a fairly high handle and two people compared to the exchange series 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:00.560
 It is a beautiful coloring like pearl-like 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:04.470
 This thorn and handle part is a little painful compared to the tire replacement series 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.480
 In behind this it is has become such a structure 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.080
 The tires are fixed at first, so it's time to leave 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.200
 It moves but this also moves but it hurts 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.100
 I'm sorry . 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.870
 so 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.200
 last 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.280
 After that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 As expected, it is cool as expected 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.830
 midnight It's light and dark This is the coolest thing 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.370
 No than anything it is this color ring Kana And quite darker 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.220
 It may be closer to now than say purple 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:44.400
 midnight roadway of the characters but I'm fine here and 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.010
 It is the other side that comes in here in after all structure in together 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.970
 This too 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.319
 By 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.579
 Five 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.150
 Easy to also be easy to hold with'm spreads out after all this part is also the like this 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.430
 is not it 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:06.210
 By the way, the two we introduced earlier were smaller than the tire replacement series 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 It's bigger than either one, especially this hey four son 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.330
 The part of the shuriken that is hanging out here is big 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:20.100
 It is something the better of here I also balance basis 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.160
 After all, this is a drop off of this goal chain and hold it as a weapon for the Tire No. Building series 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.640
 As it can be 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.520
 I want this one more two 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.849
 I clean the part And that was with a ball chain 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.470
 It is very easy to hold because it is to take 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:40.450
 This is already one 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.160
 Just a non-cage than expected but I did not expect at all in the fact that the counterproposal swing 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.110
 It is expensive 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:53.130
 I think that it is enough for ornamental, especially this Midnight Roadway seems to be in play 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.130
 It is especially recommended I can use as Teura sword of representative goods 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.060
 Thank you for your viewing 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.060
 Mountain panel registered thank you
