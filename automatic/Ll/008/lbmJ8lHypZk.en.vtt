00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
first is you get the glue put a little

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.540 
first is you get the glue put a little
bit<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> glue<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.550> less<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
bit of glue very little less is more and

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.500 
bit of glue very little less is more and
you<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.940> over<00:00:55.129> through<00:00:56.420> slightly<00:00:57.420> where

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
you just go over through slightly where

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.830 
you just go over through slightly where
you<00:01:00.510> need<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.420> pick<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.660> up

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you need this to go you can pick it up

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you need this to go you can pick it up
again<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> same<00:01:04.860> glue<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.619> then<00:01:07.619> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
again with the same glue and then just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.179 
again with the same glue and then just
place<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> goes

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.889 

and<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.729> actually<00:01:16.939> see<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.479> one<00:01:17.630> doesn't<00:01:17.869> even

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
and I actually see that one doesn't even

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.810 
and I actually see that one doesn't even
go<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.469> side<00:01:19.270> it's<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.329> wrong<00:01:20.600> one<00:01:21.820> to

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
go on that side it's the wrong one to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:32.279 
go on that side it's the wrong one to
get<00:01:23.000> rid<00:01:23.149> of<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:25.119> it's<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.360> one<00:01:26.600> in

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.660 

pick<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:33.439> up<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.159> site<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.610> want<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
pick it up the site you want it on and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:51.050 
pick it up the site you want it on and
just<00:01:37.670> drop<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.240> there<00:01:41.200> leave<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.319> off

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.690 

like<00:01:51.869> that

nice and straight nice done uh again get
bit<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.879> glue<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:16.780> over<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.049> outline<00:02:17.200> you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
bit of glue go over the outline you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:28.339 
bit of glue go over the outline you
don't<00:02:17.799> need<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.099> much<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:23.200> over<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.440> outline

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.140 

take<00:02:29.349> off<00:02:29.500> an<00:02:29.650> excess<00:02:30.099> glue<00:02:32.280> pick<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.549> again

I've done is I've reversed this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.729 
I've done is I've reversed this
toothpick<00:02:48.519> which<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.090> dry<00:02:49.420> side<00:02:50.319> with<00:02:50.349> no

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
toothpick which is the dry side with no

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.319 
toothpick which is the dry side with no
glue<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.129> goes<00:02:54.310> astray<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.120> that

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
glue on it if it goes astray like that

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:03.500 
glue on it if it goes astray like that
and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:57.010> move<00:02:57.160> on

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.800
