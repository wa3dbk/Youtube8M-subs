I mean we're talking swingarm and
digital<00:01:39.869> fuel<00:01:40.049> injection<00:01:40.530> tell<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.070> oh

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
digital fuel injection tell me that oh

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:41.719 
digital fuel injection tell me that oh
absolutely

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
absolutely

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
absolutely
so<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.390> we've<00:01:42.509> gone<00:01:42.600> ahead<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.810> done<00:01:43.049> cuz<00:01:43.350> we

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so what we've gone ahead and done cuz we

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
so what we've gone ahead and done cuz we
were<00:01:43.530> able<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> use<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.100> compact<00:01:44.610> motor<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
were able to use a compact motor is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.130 
were able to use a compact motor is
we're<00:01:45.210> able<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> actually<00:01:45.720> lengthen<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we're able to actually lengthen that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
we're able to actually lengthen that
swing<00:01:46.409> arm<00:01:46.619> keeps<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.460> wheelbase<00:01:47.850> short<00:01:48.149> for

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
swing arm keeps our wheelbase short for

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.359 
swing arm keeps our wheelbase short for
you<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:48.990> easy<00:01:49.259> turning<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:49.979> handling

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you know easy turning and good handling

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
you know easy turning and good handling
but<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> longer<00:01:51.420> swing<00:01:51.630> arm<00:01:51.780> actually

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
but the longer swing arm actually

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.139 
but the longer swing arm actually
improves<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> handling<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.610> well<00:01:53.640> something

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
improves that handling as well something

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.460 
improves that handling as well something
we<00:01:54.210> brought<00:01:54.299> over<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.689> our<00:01:54.840> race<00:01:55.020> bike<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
we brought over from our race bike so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
we brought over from our race bike so
even<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> package<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> er6n

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
even into a package like the er6n

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.139 
even into a package like the er6n
