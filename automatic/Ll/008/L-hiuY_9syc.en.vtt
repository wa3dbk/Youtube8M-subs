 and as you all already know, try with all my strength 

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.189
 Fully share who I am here in this YouTube channel. 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.896
 I have noticed, you know what, so long ago that I dedicate myself to this, 

00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:10.785
 that is now your turn. 

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.634
 So, I asked you to send me some videos 

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:14.564
 and that you share what makes you be. 

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:19.521

 - I have masses bottles with little pimples inside. 

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:40.631
 It's getting strange already. 

00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:42.562

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:01.496
 if I feel stuck 

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:03.877
 I wear these false glasses. 

00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:08.347

 No matter who you are, no matter what you are going through, 

00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:32.046
 at the end of the day if you only remember 

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.915
