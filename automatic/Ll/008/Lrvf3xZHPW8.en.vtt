00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.639
 good Sunday to all guys I'm a 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.110
 wine and welcome back with the sixtieth 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.640
 episode of the top five place of the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.440
 week today we are back with an episode 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.060
 where I decided to vary a little from 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.100
 only sniper clips in fact on the fifth 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.930
 place we start immediately that is hines parten 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.740
 who is playing on the domain will see 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.510
 with blades 27 and really makes us a clip 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 fantastic but at the same time 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.719
 incommentabile because it has anyway 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.309
 killed so many and themselves there 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.379
 point out every enemy he has killed 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.289
 you wo n't really end up like you did 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.649
 within 40 seconds 4 quad feed on 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.149
 screen and several multiples, however 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.190
 now you're seeing something anyway 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.539
 of really absurd I obviously decided 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.519
 to put her in fifth place because she is 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.199
 playing on the veteran spawn domain 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.569
 trap so maybe the difficulty isn't 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.800
 just so much but he managed to 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:56.479
 to really end a clip 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.850
 very nice then unfortunately sharpened a 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.800
 very fast core dying in a way 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.589
 quite stupid we now move on to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.239
 fourth position where we find itf k vr 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.180
 tage that is playing on deathmatch a 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.610
 teams with the luncheon score c4 and ago 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.229
 a fair quadruple and the first clip then 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.329
 also kills the fifth but then ok 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.740
 always the same game launches a c4 ne 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.329
 kills one 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.689
 4 kills are missing at the end of the game 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.000
 comes out in the spot of nuketown and makes one 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.380
 quad sit in the cam then in the same 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 game has made two beautiful clips 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.560
 compliments times the short post 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.710
 deserved to third place 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.539
 we find the reset lvs that is playing 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.460
 with the being of mirage ago 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.380
 initially a bit of a face as you can 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.670
 to see the levico missing several times 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.689
 but obviously it is all a reason for 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.969
 hide everything from the enemy and then 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.609
 thus concludes the clip really a to 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.469
 fantastic peace unfortunately periphery there 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.909
 pity about the files in the beginning though 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.700
 obviously he couldn't do much 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.079
 anyway congratulations for the sup ischemia 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.119
 really liked it because it is a 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.890
 trick shot I don't know if complex now not 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.479
 I would like to say shit anyway it seems to me 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.939
 pretty nice on everyone against all 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.320
 then closed the clip then 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.579
 congratulations from his place more than 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.270
 deserved we now pass the second 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:12.500
 position where there is psycho neos that is 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.690
 playing with him sr su strike is here it is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 in fact he immediately makes us a beautiful st 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.950
 rage I have to say start and kill some 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 enemies here and there but the real clip e 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.930
 own will start later so he killed 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.460
 already two enemies now reload comes out where 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.320

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.080
 continue to 345 on screen and then take 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.240
 also the really fantastic sixth clip 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.350
 very very nice especially because on the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.880
 taste of will the sniper is never me 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.620
