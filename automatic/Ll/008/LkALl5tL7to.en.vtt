00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
course this is all speculation if you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.690 
course this is all speculation if you

impact they haven't changed a gravity
just<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.240> outside<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.590> know

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
just because it's outside of you know

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.620 
just because it's outside of you know
gravity<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.190> home<00:03:17.370> or<00:03:17.850> whatever<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.360> out<00:03:18.480> in

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
gravity is home or whatever is out in

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.900 
gravity is home or whatever is out in
space<00:03:18.810> right<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:20.070> course<00:03:20.160> Bungie<00:03:20.760> did

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
space right but of course Bungie did

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
space right but of course Bungie did
back<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.330> day<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.110> obvious<00:03:22.200> that

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
back in the day and it's obvious that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
back in the day and it's obvious that
through<00:03:22.800> 43<00:03:23.160> isn't<00:03:23.459> doing<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.640> same<00:03:23.820> thing<00:03:24.030> as

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
through 43 isn't doing the same thing as

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.509 
through 43 isn't doing the same thing as
Bungie<00:03:24.510> did<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:25.140> make<00:03:25.620> anchor<00:03:25.980> nine<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
Bungie did like make anchor nine and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.759 
Bungie did like make anchor nine and
condemn<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.510> maps<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.170> how<00:03:28.500> about

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
condemn like maps like that how about

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.520 
condemn like maps like that how about
outer<00:03:29.040> space<00:03:29.250> effects<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.959> very

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
outer space effects like you know very

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.130 
outer space effects like you know very
very<00:03:31.830> little<00:03:32.340> gravity<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.810> core<00:03:34.019> right

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
very little gravity and that core right

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.540 
very little gravity and that core right
there<00:03:34.350> will<00:03:34.470> probably<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.920> key<00:03:35.220> part<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
there will probably be a key part of the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.150 
there will probably be a key part of the
map<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.940> orange<00:03:36.750> Electric<00:03:37.350> whips<00:03:37.680> coming

from<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> structure<00:03:38.820> also<00:03:39.060> has<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.019> a

from the structure also has more of a

from the structure also has more of a
mystery<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.610> actually<00:03:41.910> does

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
mystery to what this actually does

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.650 
mystery to what this actually does
endgame<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.950> course<00:03:43.980> what<00:03:44.519> monel<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.330> will

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
endgame and of course what monel it will

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.390 
endgame and of course what monel it will
actually<00:03:45.959> look<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.980> really<00:03:47.130> curious

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
actually look like I'm really curious

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.250 
actually look like I'm really curious
and<00:03:47.760> that's<00:03:48.239> probably<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.570> good<00:03:48.600> stopping

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
and that's probably a good stopping

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.650 
and that's probably a good stopping
point<00:03:49.590> right<00:03:49.830> there<00:03:50.000> expected<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.120> release<00:03:51.269> on
