 without exception household electronic 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.370
 waste where to do the old TV 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.720

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.490
 get rid of old household appliances in 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.960
 our country is not so easy in this 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.600
 Galina Yegorovna was convinced on her own 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.270
 experience when you got a new TV and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.079
 there was a question where to put the old began 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.200
 that newspaper 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.440
 came across an ad turns 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.270
 you can pass the old TV Putin and I 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.840
 I thought how they themselves by wire to 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.090
 trash can 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.770
 it turned out the prices of private companies on 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.200
 services for the export of large household appliances 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.810
 in Moscow start from 1000 rubles 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.370
 rent a TV 500 rubles in some 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.200
 cities there are firms that take away 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.280
 technique for free but still more 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.040
 have to pay 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.989
 These are the prices that are full of internet in 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.239
 In our case, the woman did not save 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.730
 but theoretically it could be done 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.999
 contacting your management company 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.280

 invite the management company there and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 necessarily management company to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 she accordingly presented to the inhabitants

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 for the sake of recycling an old TV 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.430
 unit 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 the vast majority of Russians 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 prefer to throw away unnecessary 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970

 printed circuit boards here are recycled 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 10,000 tons of technology is true of this 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.439
 not enough by the most conservative estimate 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.390
 environmentalists electronic household garbage 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.750
