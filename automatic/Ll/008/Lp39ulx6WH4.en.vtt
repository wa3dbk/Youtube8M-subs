cold steel right here you can see that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:15.710 
cold steel right here you can see that
yep<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.340> first<00:03:11.940> off<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:13.440> bleed<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:15.480> not

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
yep so first off this bleed it's not

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
yep so first off this bleed it's not
pointy<00:03:16.230> she<00:03:16.290> can't<00:03:17.190> really<00:03:17.430> hurt<00:03:17.610> somebody

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
pointy she can't really hurt somebody

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.140 
pointy she can't really hurt somebody
it'll<00:03:18.810> probably<00:03:19.489> sting<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> little<00:03:20.760> bit<00:03:20.880> cuz

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
it'll probably sting a little bit cuz

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.449 
it'll probably sting a little bit cuz
it's<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> rubber<00:03:22.890> knife<00:03:23.130> where<00:03:23.340> it's

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
it's not like a rubber knife where it's

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.670 
it's not like a rubber knife where it's
super<00:03:23.670> bendy<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.360> actually<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
super bendy it's actually kind of like a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.330 
super bendy it's actually kind of like a
hard<00:03:26.100> plastic<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:29.280> still<00:03:29.760> bendy<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:31.410> not<00:03:32.100> as

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
hard plastic it's still bendy but not as

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.600 
hard plastic it's still bendy but not as
Bendis<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.330> think<00:03:33.660> cuz<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.110> rubber<00:03:34.610> but

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
Bendis you think cuz it's rubber but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.390 
Bendis you think cuz it's rubber but
it's<00:03:35.730> more<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.660> hard<00:03:37.110> plastic<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:43.400> as

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
it's more like a a hard plastic and as

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.830 
it's more like a a hard plastic and as
you<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.580> see<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.270> easy<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.569> just

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
you can see it's really easy to just

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.100 
you can see it's really easy to just
flip<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.140> over<00:03:46.640> wrong<00:03:47.640> knife

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
flip it over wrong knife

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.620 
flip it over wrong knife
I<00:03:49.140> think<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> throwing<00:03:50.910> knife<00:03:50.940> if<00:03:51.480> you

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
I think for a throwing knife if you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.500 
I think for a throwing knife if you
throw<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.400> being<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.120> its<00:03:54.270> like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
throw it being because of its like

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.470 
throw it being because of its like
weight<00:03:54.810> or<00:03:55.350> whatever<00:03:55.650> it'll<00:03:56.460> have<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
weight or whatever it'll have the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.820 
weight or whatever it'll have the
momentum<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.440> keep<00:03:58.680> spinning<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.570> go

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
momentum to just keep spinning or go

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.090 
momentum to just keep spinning or go
straight<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:04.100> really<00:04:05.100> good<00:04:05.220> handling<00:04:07.100> looks

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
straight so really good handling looks

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.730 
straight so really good handling looks
really<00:04:08.550> cool<00:04:08.960> could<00:04:09.960> be<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> different<00:04:10.560> color

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
really cool could be a different color

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.890 
really cool could be a different color
but<00:04:11.070> who<00:04:11.340> really<00:04:11.490> cares<00:04:14.210> yeah<00:04:15.210> most<00:04:15.570> people

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
but who really cares yeah most people

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.470 
but who really cares yeah most people
think<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.260> because<00:04:16.890> it's<00:04:17.040> rubber<00:04:17.370> it's<00:04:18.239> like

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
think that because it's rubber it's like

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.680 
think that because it's rubber it's like
really<00:04:18.989> bendy<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:20.730> soon<00:04:21.060> as<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.239> bend<00:04:21.540> it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
really bendy but as soon as you bend it

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.350 
really bendy but as soon as you bend it
it'll<00:04:22.170> snap<00:04:22.380> right<00:04:22.650> back<00:04:22.920> to<00:04:23.520> where<00:04:23.700> it's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
it'll snap right back to where it's

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.180 
it'll snap right back to where it's
supposed<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:25.040> um<00:04:26.690> look<00:04:27.690> really<00:04:28.020> cool<00:04:28.200> the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
supposed to be um look really cool the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.640 
supposed to be um look really cool the
only<00:04:29.400> thing<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.060> kind<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.840> looks<00:04:31.080> weird<00:04:31.350> is

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
only thing that kind of looks weird is

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.750 
only thing that kind of looks weird is
that<00:04:32.000> at<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.720> tip<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.890> kinda<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:35.550> just

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that at the tip here it kinda it's just

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.890 
that at the tip here it kinda it's just
going<00:04:36.060> straight<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.600> don't<00:04:36.780> like

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
going straight and they don't like

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.920 
going straight and they don't like
spreads<00:04:37.770> out<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:39.030> that's<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.690> little

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
spreads out so that that's a little

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.350 
spreads out so that that's a little
downer<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.800> looks<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.640> looks<00:04:41.820> kind<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.180> weird

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
downer and looks it looks kind of weird

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.200 
downer and looks it looks kind of weird
but<00:04:43.350> uh<00:04:43.380> overall<00:04:43.800> looks<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.730> really<00:04:45.030> cool

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
but uh overall looks like a really cool

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.170 
but uh overall looks like a really cool
knife<00:04:45.740> it's<00:04:46.740> my<00:04:47.010> first<00:04:47.220> time<00:04:47.370> in<00:04:47.550> boxing<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.090> I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
knife it's my first time in boxing and I

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.820 
knife it's my first time in boxing and I
didn't<00:04:48.390> like<00:04:48.600> open<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.290> then<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.470> look<00:04:49.680> at

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
didn't like open it and then I look at

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.260 
didn't like open it and then I look at
it<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:52.830> also<00:04:52.980> thought<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.580> would<00:04:53.880> get<00:04:54.060> a

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it so and I also thought I would get a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.460 
it so and I also thought I would get a
little<00:04:54.360> bit<00:04:54.600> more<00:04:55.880> these<00:04:57.169> that's<00:04:58.169> just

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
little bit more these that's just

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.460 
little bit more these that's just
something<00:04:58.710> else<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.690> would<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:00.990> you

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
something else I would think that you

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.850 
something else I would think that you
would<00:05:01.590> get<00:05:01.740> like<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.840> know<00:05:03.960> something<00:05:04.440> from

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
would get like you know something from

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.420 
would get like you know something from
cold<00:05:05.130> steel<00:05:05.550> except<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.330> knife<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:07.430> you

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
cold steel except for the knife like you

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.370 
cold steel except for the knife like you
know<00:05:08.520> maybe<00:05:08.910> like<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.330> knife<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.840> box<00:05:10.110> of

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
know maybe like the knife is in a box of

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.159 
know maybe like the knife is in a box of
cold<00:05:10.620> steel<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:10.980> don't<00:05:11.250> know<00:05:11.400> but<00:05:11.640> it's<00:05:12.630> kind<00:05:13.110> of

cold steel I don't know but it's kind of

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.810

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
weird that they just put it right in the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.200 
weird that they just put it right in the
box<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.360> send<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.840> out<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.230> but<00:05:17.180> still<00:05:18.180> a
