for that's why I really don't mind but
this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.979> still<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.460> especially<00:01:38.790> if

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this is really still good especially if

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
this is really still good especially if
you're<00:01:39.240> trying<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> avoid<00:01:39.689> gel<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.439> Jose<00:01:40.650> don't

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you're trying to avoid gel if Jose don't

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
you're trying to avoid gel if Jose don't
work<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.340> he<00:01:41.460> does<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:42.390> no

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
work for you because he does there's no

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.350 
work for you because he does there's no
point<00:01:42.840> gels<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:43.770> better<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.369> my<00:01:44.460> opinion<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
point gels work better in my opinion but

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
point gels work better in my opinion but
if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:45.990> gels<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.530> some<00:01:46.710> reason<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
if you don't like gels for some reason I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.149 
if you don't like gels for some reason I
