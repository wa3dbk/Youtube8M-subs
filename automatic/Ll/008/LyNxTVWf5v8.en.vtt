00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
makes it a little bit easier to obtain

same model so you can just buy that with

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.619 
same model so you can just buy that with
justice<00:01:02.730> points<00:01:02.910> instead<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> actually

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
justice points instead of actually

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690

farming at local court and similarly

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
farming at local court and similarly

he takes all of five minutes especially
at<00:02:14.310> ninety<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.060> um<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.690> shield<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.110> also<00:02:16.440> from

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
at ninety and um the shield is also from

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.960 
at ninety and um the shield is also from
a<00:02:16.650> quest<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> Shadowmoon<00:02:17.370> Valley<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.760> at

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
a quest in Shadowmoon Valley but it's at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.700 
a quest in Shadowmoon Valley but it's at
the<00:02:18.060> end<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.300> chain<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.320> takes<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.590> little

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the end of a chain so it takes a little

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.050 
the end of a chain so it takes a little
bit<00:02:19.830> longer<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.400> ninety<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:20.940> probably

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
bit longer but a ninety it will probably

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
bit longer but a ninety it will probably
take<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.330> only<00:02:21.480> 25<00:02:21.930> minutes<00:02:22.170> half<00:02:22.470> an<00:02:22.620> hour<00:02:22.770> so

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
take you only 25 minutes half an hour so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980 
take you only 25 minutes half an hour so
it's<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.520> easy<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.820> get<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:24.630> once<00:02:24.840> again

on the entirety of this ectomy bought

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
on the entirety of this ectomy bought
for<00:02:38.610> honor<00:02:38.790> points<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:39.750> really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
for honor points actually so it's really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.300 
for honor points actually so it's really
easy<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.710> farm<00:02:40.980> anything

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
easy to get you don't the farm anything

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.880 
easy to get you don't the farm anything
but<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.940> costs<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.450> quite<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> few<00:02:43.230> honor<00:02:43.440> points

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
but it costs a quite a few honor points

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.200 
but it costs a quite a few honor points
I<00:02:43.980> guess<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.610> about<00:02:44.760> four<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.060> five

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
I guess I think it's about four or five

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.430 
I guess I think it's about four or five
thousand<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> whole<00:02:45.960> set<00:02:46.170> which<00:02:46.320> isn't

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
of them which is why I only have one

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.740 
of them which is why I only have one
equipped<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:14.970> they<00:03:15.120> sheath<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.480> your<00:03:15.600> back

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
which is really awesome and I think they

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.800 
which is really awesome and I think they
cost<00:03:17.400> about<00:03:17.670> two<00:03:17.940> thousand<00:03:18.330> hundred<00:03:18.570> points

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810

sense that it's still from current
content<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.770> guess<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.580> basically<00:05:02.940> it's<00:05:03.120> just

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
content I guess so basically it's just

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.090 
content I guess so basically it's just
the<00:05:03.420> warrior<00:05:03.690> tier<00:05:03.900> 15<00:05:04.110> set<00:05:04.500> from<00:05:04.710> throne<00:05:05.010> a
