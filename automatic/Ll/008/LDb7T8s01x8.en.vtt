00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.290
 open your favorite photo in 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.590
 photoshop 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.529
 I took one of the recognizable monuments 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.230
 architecture of your city 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.700
 and light the brightening of the photos then 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:37.010
 airing by application 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:39.640
 white field around the image remind 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.250
 that photo we will convert 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.430
 in watercolor drawing 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.880
 so we need this one 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.880
 airiness and ease of image 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.730
 send the resulting image to 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.790
 print typing clearly 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.770
 watercolor paper is an important point 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.770
 print me on photo paper 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.179
 now we need to circle the resulting 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.990
 image black ballpoint pen 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:22.810
 You can use any marker but 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.060
 just to keep ink from flowing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 because then we will 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 interact with water and contour 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.149
 we make whether or not to continue 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.989
 did not see loosely intermittent 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:43.849
 in the image there should be some 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:47.890
 scenic graphicity such as how 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:52.569
 we see in book illustrations or on 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.569
 graphic drawings 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.230
 if any line is missing then 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.770
 after completing work on everything 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.940
 images at the very last stage 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.190
 some elements can be added 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.160
 make a thickening 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 lines or add missing 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.730
 finish working with the contour and we will 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.730
 move on to the next stage of work 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.350
 the next stage of work we wet 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 spray water image 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 we need from the photographic 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.110
 images get picturesque 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.990
 image created 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.750
 watercolor we moistened drawing water 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:08.310
 printer ink begins to fade and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.460
 we complement the color of the picture with watercolor 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.460
 paints 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.450
 in this way we completely change 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:21.690
 image perception photograph 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.000
 converted to pictorial 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.690
 artistic drawing 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.920
 so you can understand how to build 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:37.230
 artistic image as far as she is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:41.370
 much more different from photos 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.590
 number of colors optional 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.959
 reflexes respect 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.519
 warm and cold colors 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.459
 attention to the church building I 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.400
 light part of the color part add 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:06.200
 yellow and shadow part 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:11.610
 I have a colder artist always 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:15.620
 works more with color and this one 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.200
 fluidity work with color 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.889
 distinguishes the artistic image from 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.889
 Photo 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.480
 resulting image 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.080
 can be used as a souvenir as 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.130
 source image to create 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 magnets or other souvenirs 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.289
 also 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.259
 I think this image will be nice 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.259
 look into frames 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.280
 as you see we have completely changed 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.430
 completely converted the original 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.430
 picture 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.770
 now it's up to details 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.259
 I add a warm reflex under the roof of the house 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.639
 give volume 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.639
 dome churches 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.880
 I strengthen 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.880
 light shadow part of the job 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.340
 as you see the dark outline slightly 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.270
 underline the image leaves it in 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.270
 visible borders 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.449
 like this from photos 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.449
 we did the painting work 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.090
 pay attention to the resulting 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.090
 result
