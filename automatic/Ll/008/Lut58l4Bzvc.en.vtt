00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.599
 yes hello and welcome i am 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.849
 the silly and today a little video 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 how to get the speedport w 700v and 20 vk 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 the port releases for the game piece of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.980
 So prey is already a tutorial 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.349
 he had made himself almost makes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 could also look like it or 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:29.750
 so you can go other ports two 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.520
 for other games you need it 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.530
 new devices passport that it on the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.330
 backside of new speedport 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 usually if you did not change it 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.060
 and otherwise he would have got into it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:01:00.120
 internet goes up here 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:01:02.490
 http j.mp should wait a moment 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.729
 actually work faster 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.359
 end hch wegmann yes exactly ok so one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.679
 usb port point ip enter without http 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:15.079
 then you come here on the rethmann 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:18.689
 usb port w7 we 20 cm 24 v 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:22.999
 the device password I must now only 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:37.280
 give me a note 

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:37.280
 at the moment login 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.619
 then it comes down to building nothing more 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.030
 just cancel 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.700
 then that is was with internet 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.159
 usually and he stands here port 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.299
 activation port activation 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.850
 dynamic port activation needs 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.369
 you do not detour there and port 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.389
 forwarding he is on it and at 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399
 I am here for example now 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:08.430
 already in 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.850
 that could delete everything now we 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 show how this works 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.570
 to save 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.190
 that has blasphemed it and others 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.410
 tcp redirects insert title on it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.470
 then here's the portraits of prey 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:36.170
 now you can also say yes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.170
 gives from 99 from 1900 to 9000 euro 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.670
 1910 and video games such as more things 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.290
 We also have more of the clearers 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.300
 only the 9 933 933 then like a device 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.640
 select example here the phones or 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.090
 my pc 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.500
 another at another pc and calm 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.580
 equipment planning 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.220
 Well, but my first pc stretch that 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.130
 is the tcp redirection we need 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.150
 once and once we need the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.959
 Redirection there would be exactly the same 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.959
 just go down 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:24.209
 933 933 violence choose my pc if you 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.380
 normally represents either a pc name 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.100
 in there and I have around there and this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.110
 IP address 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.320
 then just have to look which 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.040
 ip-address had me first 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.450
 to save 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 then we have it all 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.670
 saved that we have saved 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.010
 then we are already done so can 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.200
 So your port unlock here 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.810
 port forwarding redirection 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.660
 forwarding is virtually left 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.620
 become 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:00.090
 that was the speedport lockout like that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:05.040
 if you want to know because then only one 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:11.640
 ip is here on it cmd public that 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:15.180
 window to ip config confixx right 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 bad I think lp confectionery exactly 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.160
 then you are here at ip address 192 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.970
 168 2 1 of the 3 this is not the 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.910
 Internet address and ip addresses 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.770
 where red gives you the ip you then 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.690
 in the internet you can almost 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.760
 choose if you can do it then and 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.860
 write in here what is my ip then 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.390
 you appear you will have done that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.039
 I do not know what everyone knows 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.760
 for an internet ip would like to have 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.560
 I do not because you can order now 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.600
 your example then my beast of prey 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.010
 player going in or out 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.740
 then you can open up an example here 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.729
 which then go in with you 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.590
 our things yes what else is there too 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.139
 say 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.259
 exactly sometimes or most of the time you have to 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.810
 your port still your internet security 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.970
 if it's still free from microsoft 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.780
 you have to have it in windows 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.039
 so to speak, microsoft windows and 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.020
 also released the port and at 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.539
 kaspersky for example what I have here 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.979
 you also have to clear the park then 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.590
 I think that's up to me 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:29.479
 Settings was that I again 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:32.569
 Watching it expand was the last 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.620
 once found so should not be too difficult 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.289
 be found 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.210
 jobcenter da firewall right at yours 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.060
 at the celebration would have to quasi import 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.789
 release the very other who the port 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.479
 get involved with you when you play 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:51.190
 Once upon a time, what does the normal one do? 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.020
 do not release a rule violation report 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.630
 and then you can network here 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.719
 or you can adjust rules then 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.610
 also create some rule 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:06.639
 adapt for programs and was with me 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.639
 the tcp ip 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:17.800
 that means it even only called me like it 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.710
 was said was I must be in the list 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.889
 as well network rule number 16 is 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.860
 tc piding with me is with me 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.360
 in there and it is allowed on here 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.069
 that's because I've got this 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.190
 993 3 released 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:38.659
 for this game virtually zero and rain 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.710
 adapt programs there it is then necessary 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.960
 you click through it 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.789
 because everyone had the have the 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.770
 Kaspersky 's underwear here 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.990
 different versions drawn 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.030
 different things are called if it 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.349
 When entering google it is from kaspersky 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.940
 myself also nice described how to 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:58.099
 I would definitely do that 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.930
 yes then it was already heard in the small 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.839
 fine tutorial how to be death 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.949
 releases at the speed ford of the 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:12.889
 telekom speedport w 70 24 v have the type 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:18.550
 a and then have fun while gambling and until 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.550
 soon and tell me now dire lee
