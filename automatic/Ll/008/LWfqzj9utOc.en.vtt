00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.560
 with the movistar cup and we go to 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.990
 stadium manuel rivera in chimbote for 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.610
 see legal to install glass against 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.750
 university next Sunday and 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.230
 glass closes from local against scienceno 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.230
 excellent to close 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.960
 trip 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.250
 summarize this party not always legal 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 the best team of cyclists won today 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.720
 I was already but a little bit to finish 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.890
 the first tournament because it closed the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.790
 championship when 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 it would be an emotion with the beast because 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.989
 I was working watching 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.989
 observe here 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.080
 the right toché cygan mezarina 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.660
 and salcedo and fire 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.660
 no minute 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 Excellent 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.549
 for me 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.210
 but for me it is a mistake an error 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 frequent and teams do not have to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.030
 avoid playing as the goalie in the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.110
 possible measure should not be given to the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 ball for those who solve a bad 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 side outlet 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 sea 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.509
 he had already gotten a head pass 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.240
 a previous one and it seemed that here and here 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.240
 is with which Washington has improved 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.440
 keep going down 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.960
 you have that had ripped the wheels 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960
 for me 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.850
 finally the crossbar saves him 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.860
 I think he did not disappoint because the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.070
 intensity that corresponds to part of 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.070
 Welsh 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.790
 replacing Juan Carlos Mariño and this one 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.790
 it was out 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.030
 the video 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.580
 good can happen 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.580
 alexander around 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.680
 and with him to that subject 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.360
 it was not a ball so showy but clear 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.580
 as you said last week the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.580
 facilities to the majority is just 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.740
 legal 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.740
 it's a shame for so much 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.709
 goal by josé mesarina without mesalina si 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.000
 this is the level of regret and the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.000
 regularity the selection 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.569
 is a right side with a technique 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.569
 as few 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.030
 because he just 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.979
 because we had an exceptional year and 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.329
 we are the streak taba is saving 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.530
 all the good things we had done 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.910
 good that we get results 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.740
 we broke the streak we continue in the race 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.750
 so they are all positive things for 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.729
 to add and to face state these 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.400
 two weeks left the game is 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.229
 conditioned by the the 36 seconds that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 they can not make a goal to a team that 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.120
 pretend to be a champion and then for a 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.340
 second ball that I do not know if it was foul or 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.470
 he released her if it was good favor this later 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.150
 that the referee has not seen him and if the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.780
 released now good eye have saved us 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.780
 many times 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.440
 to see is not any hand not like before 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.440
 never the ball never 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.080
 for glass 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.310
 I believe that his first best first 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.110
 bloopers and yes yes I think it would be 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.610
 unjust there is no fauna now I do believe that 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.660
 there is a difference with thin not me 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.660
 it seems that they are different hierarchy
