00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this on the paper and add the water if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
this on the paper and add the water if
you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.300> space<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.140> might<00:00:52.379> want

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you have a bit more space you might want

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
you have a bit more space you might want
to<00:00:52.710> start<00:00:53.160> putting<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.579> few<00:00:53.789> colors<00:00:54.149> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
to start putting a few colors in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.540 
to start putting a few colors in
something<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.390> use

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
something like this and so you can use

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.290 
something like this and so you can use
these<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.760> faber<00:01:00.000> castell<00:01:00.480> pencils<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.300> this

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
these are faber castell pencils and this

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.130 
these are faber castell pencils and this
is<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> set<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.140> use<00:01:05.420> we<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is a set that I use we don't use it in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960 
is a set that I use we don't use it in
the<00:01:07.260> team<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.520> take<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the team when I'm on the go I take the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
the team when I'm on the go I take the
pencils<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:11.420> what<00:01:12.420> I've<00:01:12.570> done<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.869> just

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
pencils out and what I've done is just

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.969 
pencils out and what I've done is just
cut<00:01:13.830> away<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.729> extra<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.680> wood

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
cut away a little bit extra of the wood

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.740 
cut away a little bit extra of the wood
so<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> color<00:01:19.340> exposed

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
so that I have more of the color exposed

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
so that I have more of the color exposed
because<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:21.960> you're<00:01:22.110> using<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> want<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
because when you're using it you want to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
because when you're using it you want to
be<00:01:23.280> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> rub<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> end<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> brush<00:01:25.470> onto

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
be able to rub the end of the brush onto

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
be able to rub the end of the brush onto
the<00:01:26.070> color<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.049> color

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the color and if there's more color

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.660 
the color and if there's more color
exposed<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.189> easier<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.360> these<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.670> typically

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
exposed it's easier so these I typically

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.810 
exposed it's easier so these I typically
put<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> pencil<00:01:33.810> case<00:01:34.220> with<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.460> little

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
put into a pencil case with my little

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.399 
put into a pencil case with my little
watercolor<00:01:36.420> brush

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
watercolor brush

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.260 
watercolor brush
my<00:01:39.409> pencil<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:41.200> my<00:01:42.200> black<00:01:42.530> pen<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.579> I<00:01:44.030> need

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
my pencil and my black pen if I need

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.709

extra water I just use one of these put
water<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.719> it's<00:01:50.719> great<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:51.200> you

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
water in it and it's great because you

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.899 
water in it and it's great because you
unscrew<00:01:51.859> it<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.310> you've<00:01:52.429> got<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> little

unscrew it and you've got a little

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.149 
unscrew it and you've got a little
container<00:01:53.450> here<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.649> can<00:01:54.890> pour<00:01:55.130> water
