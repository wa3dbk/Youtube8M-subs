00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
financial numbers on what they did but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.600 
financial numbers on what they did but
basically<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.770> goal<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.220> one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
basically if the goal was to make one

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.670 
basically if the goal was to make one
dollar<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.810> hit<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.079> goal<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.470> one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
dollar and if we hit that goal of one

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.770 
dollar and if we hit that goal of one
dollar<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.090> mad<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.570> didn't

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
dollar they would get mad that we didn't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.319 
dollar they would get mad that we didn't
exceed<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.469> dollar<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.149> be

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
exceed that one dollar so it would be

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510 
exceed that one dollar so it would be
why<00:02:00.750> didn't<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.530> dollars<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
why didn't you make two dollars and this

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
why didn't you make two dollars and this
was<00:02:02.700> consistent<00:02:03.090> month<00:02:03.719> after<00:02:03.899> month<00:02:04.229> week

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
was consistent month after month week

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.730 
was consistent month after month week
after<00:02:05.159> week<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:06.210> mind<00:02:06.479> goals<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.560> hit

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
after week I don't mind goals to hit

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
after week I don't mind goals to hit
because<00:02:07.950> I'm<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.160> goal-oriented<00:02:08.759> person<00:02:08.940> but

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
because I'm a goal-oriented person but

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.220 
because I'm a goal-oriented person but
it's<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> way<00:02:10.470> they

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
it's the way they

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.339 
it's the way they
coached<00:02:12.159> us<00:02:12.459> into<00:02:12.940> hitting<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.480> goal<00:02:13.780> they
