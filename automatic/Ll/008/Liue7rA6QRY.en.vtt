00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.729
 also 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.089
 sure you have noticed more than once 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.279
 in summer 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 Climbing plants are very loose 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.109
 those plants to the guards 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.420
 bugambilias are two plants that love the heat 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.460
 they love the sunny areas 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 and when it starts to bloom strongly in its controls more temperature we have 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 in the environment 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have to take into account efe 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.230
 being a plant 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.320
 that needs a lot of heat 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.030
 we have to locate them 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.310
 south-southeast orientation southwest 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.370
 in an area where the roof is not too windy and that it is 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 protected 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 especially for the inclemencies of the winter 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.440
 it is a plant that does not require excessive merciless, rather the opposite in 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.200
 periods of drought 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 oo of little water the plant blooms best ladies quantity of flowers and inc has a 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.830
 excess moisture 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 maybe by mule 1 yellow in the leaves 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 depending on the variety for example the purple variety fuchsia globality are 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.500
 very vigorous varieties then it may be that the plant tends to grow a lot 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 if we cut them edil the irrigation and we provide a fertilizer potassium no 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 We always want to export anything that is not a little bit more said 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.750
 another one of the reasons why in the leaf you in the bougainville can marÃ­as 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.970
 for making a lack of 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.980
 in urgent and especially a lack of iron in those nutrients 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.550
 so that the sheet 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.050
 It will take its green tone of strong we should bring a little 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.720
 that the iron cross and the plant would recover quickly 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.760
 as before being done p 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.289
 this plant 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.859
 he needs 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.819
 Unamuno rich in potassium are the fertilizers that are commonly used to 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.659
 in strangers for flower plants also for fruit trees 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:25.029
 the pests that normally attack this plant sulser the van in spring if 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.519
 they say we find them in the new meetings that 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.039
 that come out from winter 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.589
 percent the red spider so the summer we can find a little bit of spider 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.089
 red when it's hot 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.069
 and without it the cochineal is also a plague that 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.279
 if you attack me enough, half praised 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.779
 with these three insecticides we could generate to be perfectly 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.709
 the three plagues that we have said that could have more of the bougainvillea 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 cochineal museum in red spider has the lungs the bougainvillea to be 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.909
 a vigorous growth plant 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 we have to control the mediation by pruning 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.409
 the best time of pruning good asia when 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.559
 photo years that is coming to an end and before the arrival of 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.379
 cold of winter or when winter also comes to an end and the first 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.959
 heats of spring 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.719
 the reason for these dates 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.469
 to prune the bougainvilleas is to not get caught 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.709
 to the freshly cut plant 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 one of the winter frosts that could cause death 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.199
 encourage you to place this plant with the advice lagged because if you have a 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.319
 wall where 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.299
 in place it is worth with the one of the wall perfectly itene and sector during 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 All summer 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.009
 prob 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.319
 but they also died 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.349
 First
