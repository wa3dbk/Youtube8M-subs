00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
air cells will remain intact I put it in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.469 
air cells will remain intact I put it in
this<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.320> roll<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.330> like

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this way and I roll it up so I get like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
this way and I roll it up so I get like
that<00:01:11.030> then<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.350> make<00:01:13.350> sure<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:13.920> cut<00:01:14.430> end<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that then I make sure that my cut end is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
that then I make sure that my cut end is
up<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.360> tells<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.049> end<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.770> up

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
up this tells me which end will be up

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.840 
up this tells me which end will be up
when<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> packaged<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> Box<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.670> roll<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

and I just put a quick piece of tape on
each<00:01:35.310> end<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.689> egg<00:01:36.840> does<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.220> fall<00:01:38.220> out

each end so the egg does not fall out

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.969 
each end so the egg does not fall out
put<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.549> other<00:01:41.700> eggs<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.710> the

these<00:01:57.540> pieces<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.380> bubble<00:01:58.590> wrap<00:01:58.770> are

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
these pieces of bubble wrap are

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.639 
these pieces of bubble wrap are
approximately<00:02:00.210> between<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:01.259> right

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
approximately between there right

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.830 
approximately between there right
between<00:02:01.979> 7<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.549> 8<00:02:02.640> inches<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.240> found<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.659> that

between 7 and 8 inches I found that that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.119 
between 7 and 8 inches I found that that
