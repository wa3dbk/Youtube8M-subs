the issues online right now playing out

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.569 
the issues online right now playing out
over<00:02:18.989> three<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.859> can't<00:02:20.129> join<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> session

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
over three we can't join a session

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.050 
over three we can't join a session
because<00:02:20.879> he's<00:02:21.090> appeared<00:02:21.450> offline<00:02:21.719> damn<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.620> oh

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
because he's appeared offline damn it oh

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
because he's appeared offline damn it oh
yeah<00:02:24.060> those<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.659> who<00:02:24.840> were<00:02:24.870> thinking<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
yeah those of you who were thinking to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.319 
yeah those of you who were thinking to
send<00:02:25.829> her<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> message<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.549> hope<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:26.790> her<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
send her a message and hope for her to

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.849 
send her a message and hope for her to
send<00:02:27.569> back<00:02:27.750> or<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.109> anyone<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> crew

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
send back or just anyone in the crew

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.979 
send back or just anyone in the crew
just<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> could<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:30.180> their<00:02:30.329> profile<00:02:30.719> joint

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
just you could do their profile joint

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.990 
just you could do their profile joint
session<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.950> probably<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.849> good

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
session and that is probably not a good

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.690 
session and that is probably not a good
idea<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.389> they<00:02:33.599> all<00:02:33.750> appear<00:02:34.109> offline

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
idea because they all appear offline

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.580 
idea because they all appear offline
