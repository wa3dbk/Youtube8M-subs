 thank you very much that the truth has the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.520
 ica's collaboration would not have 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.800
 could reach this this certification 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.320
 that is so important that all 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 cattlemen we must fight to obtain 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.190
 that there are a series of rules that you have to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.129
 meet and they would not be the very important 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.140
 for the benefit of livestock that 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.190
 all farmers of all 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.100
 things that manage the sector 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.490
 agriculture and that it links as an entity in 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.680
 these 45 years because it enforces them 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.030
 the good welfare of all these 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.630
 people who send to the sector 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.160
 agricultural 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.410
 decree 616 7 adviser the decree 616 has 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.750
 due to live as a result of work 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.089
 set between the ica the ministry of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.090
 esther social protection and agriculture 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.310
 in order to improve the conditions of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.850
 the entire dairy chain from the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.530
 herd production the processors and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 the final issuance of certificates 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.430
 sanitary milk as a product 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.970
 innocuous 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 for consumers with products or 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.730
 be that it is healthy to its consumers 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.610
 and that this also seeks the welfare of the 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.200
 producer of competitiveness and that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 have a healthy product for all 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.830
 Colombians and also exporter when 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.619
 will export the fulfillment of this 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.450
 decree is fundamental to the process 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.210
 of insertion of dairy products 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.860
 Colombians in the markets 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.760
 international that I liked us 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.310
 we visited previous ones and we have them as in 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.320
 previous high-risk categories that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.570
 they mobilize a lot we do the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.750
 visits and we also guarantee that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.090
 biological is fine that the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.950
 distributors are doing well and 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.990
 that the vaccinators are making a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.060
 good activity to guarantee that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.830
 protection to animals what happens with 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.690
 the farmer who arrives I do not believe of the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.489
 eggs well we also have to be 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.430
 unique unique strong that enforces the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.820
 regulations and there are sanctions and one 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.770
 has but not been productive 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.600
 it necessarily has to be a hand 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.910
 for all in institutions like the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.120
 health because it is the fundamental basis 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.580
 of the act but people know people will 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.690
 says or not that what should do that already 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 is invented then is to follow the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.940
 steps that the training program 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.760
 see all producers 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.970
 dairymen that effectively are 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 taking out a product and not the market 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.720
 independent of the amount of liters 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.670
 that produce a dependent of the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 infrastructure or be helpless to the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.570
 production with mechanical milking 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.920
 milking tank for another was also is 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.510
 valid as long as it is complied with 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.070
 all good practices channels if 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.300
 we dismiss the rules because we have 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.710
 which is to ask us not to 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.610
 we sit every day for sale nothing 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.540
 more, we are regulating 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.700
 conformity with what exists today 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.990
 in the world market every day will see 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.340
 more demands on producers 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.660
 agricultural exports 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.460
 agriculture and we have to be 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.350
 regulating so that our agriculture 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.520
 then have the possibility to enter 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.520
 the international markets
