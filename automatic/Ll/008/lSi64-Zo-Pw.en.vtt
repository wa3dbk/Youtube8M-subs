behind<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.450> fuel<00:01:13.690> pump<00:01:13.990> if<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.470> have<00:01:14.650> one<00:01:14.890> and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
behind the fuel pump if you have one and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.940 
behind the fuel pump if you have one and
there<00:01:16.270> are<00:01:16.300> a<00:01:16.360> couple<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:16.690> clips<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.230> hold<00:01:17.620> it

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
there are a couple of clips that hold it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.470 
there are a couple of clips that hold it
that's<00:01:18.250> very<00:01:18.340> important<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.210> doesn't

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
that's very important so it doesn't

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.660 
that's very important so it doesn't
interfere<00:01:19.960> with<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.560> steering<00:01:20.830> rack<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.550> is

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
interfere with the steering rack this is

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.240 
interfere with the steering rack this is
line<00:01:21.940> five<00:01:22.360> right<00:01:22.930> front<00:01:24.690> again<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.080> clip<00:01:26.470> to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
the Flex line which you should always

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.150 
the Flex line which you should always
replace<00:01:29.200> these<00:01:29.380> if<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.680> don't<00:01:29.890> know<00:01:29.980> how<00:01:30.100> old

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
replace these if you don't know how old

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.050 
replace these if you don't know how old
they<00:01:30.580> are<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.560> front<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
go from the flex line to the banjo

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.190 
go from the flex line to the banjo
fitting<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.750> caliper<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.550> is<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
fitting on the caliper now this is a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.930 
fitting on the caliper now this is a
aluminum<00:01:55.200> caliper<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.400> has<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.580> bridge

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
aluminum caliper so that it has a bridge

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.380 
aluminum caliper so that it has a bridge
pipe<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.350> side<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.390> these

pipe from one side to the other these

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
pipe from one side to the other these
are<00:02:00.450> probably<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> trickiest<00:02:01.200> lines<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.010> bend

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
are probably the trickiest lines to bend

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.390 
are probably the trickiest lines to bend
up<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> whole<00:02:03.600> kit<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.010> the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
up out of the whole kit because the the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.910 
up out of the whole kit because the the
exact<00:02:05.790> location<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.720> very<00:02:06.780> important<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
exact location is very important you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669 
exact location is very important you
know<00:02:08.070> where<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.580> where<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:09.000> ends<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.530> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
know where that where it ends up and you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.729 
know where that where it ends up and you
may<00:02:10.830> choose<00:02:11.100> not<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.670> replace<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.270> lines<00:02:12.739> if

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
may choose not to replace these lines if

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.220 
may choose not to replace these lines if
you're<00:02:13.980> not<00:02:14.100> comfortable<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:15.810> bending

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you're not comfortable with with bending

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.050 
you're not comfortable with with bending
them<00:02:16.380> up<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.709> usually<00:02:17.459> they're<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.850> pretty

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
