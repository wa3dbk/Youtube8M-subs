hills and I am there's that one kind of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
hills and I am there's that one kind of
technical<00:01:40.170> section<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> road<00:01:41.520> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
technical section it's a road but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
technical section it's a road but
there's<00:01:41.909> both<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.659> rocks<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.259> big<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
there's both you know rocks this big and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
there's both you know rocks this big and
so<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.490> trying<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> navigate<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.299> for

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so you're trying to navigate that for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
so you're trying to navigate that for
like<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> mile<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> half<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.490> made<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like a mile and a half and i just made a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130 
like a mile and a half and i just made a
conscious<00:01:47.970> effort<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> push<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.840> hard<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
conscious effort to push as hard as I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.889 
conscious effort to push as hard as I
could<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.590> knew<00:01:49.740> once<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.009> got<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
could because I knew once I got to the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
could because I knew once I got to the
15.5<00:01:51.899> halfway<00:01:52.409> aid<00:01:53.070> station<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> doing<00:01:53.850> out

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
15.5 halfway aid station you doing out

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
15.5 halfway aid station you doing out
and<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.600> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.290> had

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and back and I want to make sure I had

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.969 
and back and I want to make sure I had
still<00:01:56.430> out<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> good<00:01:56.759> cushion<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
still out a good cushion there so I I

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.180 
still out a good cushion there so I I
push<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> down<00:01:59.579> too<00:01:59.759> hard

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
push that down too hard

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.220 
push that down too hard
think<00:02:00.430> Assad<00:02:00.700> about<00:02:01.420> four<00:02:01.720> minutes<00:02:01.900> there

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
think Assad about four minutes there

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.050 
think Assad about four minutes there
which<00:02:02.410> was<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.860> same<00:02:03.070> as<00:02:03.100> hidden<00:02:03.400> peak<00:02:03.700> so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
which was the same as hidden peak so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.760 
which was the same as hidden peak so
gotcha<00:02:04.510> how<00:02:04.780> did<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.080> how<00:02:05.530> do<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.680> actually

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
gotcha how did I how do you actually

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.130 
gotcha how did I how do you actually
navigate<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:07.090> rocky<00:02:07.300> cobbled<00:02:07.810> section

any<00:05:14.890> mountains<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.490> mean<00:05:16.360> just<00:05:16.390> mainly<00:05:16.750> getting

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
any mountains I mean just mainly getting

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.659 
any mountains I mean just mainly getting
more<00:05:17.290> vertical<00:05:17.740> in<00:05:17.830> your<00:05:17.950> training<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.370> think

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
more vertical in your training I think

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.550 
more vertical in your training I think
he'll<00:05:19.120> training<00:05:19.540> it's<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.900> lot<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.200> strength

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
he'll training it's in a lot of strength

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.590 
he'll training it's in a lot of strength
and<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:21.160> know<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:21.940> lot<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.180> people<00:05:22.270> live<00:05:22.570> in

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.460 
and I know a lot of people live in
environments<00:05:22.780> where<00:05:23.140> they<00:05:23.229> don't<00:05:23.410> have

environments where they don't have

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.340 
environments where they don't have
mountains<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.270> used<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.870> ramp<00:05:26.050> up<00:05:26.169> my

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
Washington and so any Hill training I

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.280 
Washington and so any Hill training I
guess<00:05:30.190> that's<00:05:30.370> just<00:05:30.430> uphill<00:05:30.880> but<00:05:31.060> some<00:05:31.840> some

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
guess that's just uphill but some some

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.570 
guess that's just uphill but some some
troubles<00:05:32.590> go<00:05:32.740> will<00:05:32.950> be<00:05:33.130> fine

troubles go will be fine

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.939 
troubles go will be fine

good fine you know a little pillow you

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.710 
good fine you know a little pillow you
could<00:05:38.110> do<00:05:38.439> repeats<00:05:38.830> up<00:05:39.009> that<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.430> go<00:05:40.300> down<00:05:40.479> and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
could do repeats up that and go down and

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.249 
could do repeats up that and go down and
fast<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.199> doing<00:05:42.189> more<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.789> know<00:05:43.259> off-road

fast to doing more you know off-road

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.920 
fast to doing more you know off-road
trail<00:05:44.590> running<00:05:44.830> rather<00:05:45.370> than<00:05:45.610> just<00:05:45.930> speed

trail running rather than just speed

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.529

work<00:05:47.139> on<00:05:47.319> the<00:05:47.409> track<00:05:47.680> or<00:05:47.710> tempo<00:05:48.430> tempo<00:05:49.090> runs<00:05:49.419> in

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
work on the track or tempo tempo runs in

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.540 
work on the track or tempo tempo runs in
the<00:05:49.629> woods<00:05:49.919> getting<00:05:50.919> out<00:05:51.069> there<00:05:51.250> and<00:05:51.310> then

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
the woods getting out there and then

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.309 
the woods getting out there and then
lengthening<00:05:52.060> your<00:05:52.120> long<00:05:52.419> run<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.840> guess<00:05:53.080> is

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
lengthening your long run to I guess is

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.959 
lengthening your long run to I guess is
the<00:05:53.860> other<00:05:53.979> thing<00:05:54.039> spending<00:05:54.610> time<00:05:54.729> on<00:05:54.849> your
