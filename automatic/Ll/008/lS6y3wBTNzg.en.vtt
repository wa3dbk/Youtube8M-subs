00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.820
 Hello everyone today I propose you a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.789
 stuffed focaccia baked in the oven with 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.380
 cooked ham and smoked scamorza cheese 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.079
 one has already been proposed in the past 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.430
 stuffed focaccia but pan-fried cup 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.400
 in ten minutes 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.769
 if you want to see the video I'll put it in 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.379
 overlay in video cards 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.720
 or in the limbo box below the video 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.790
 therefore we have now a 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.190
 see all the ingredients and phases 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.690
 preparation for this year's hunt 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.690
 stuffed baked in the oven 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.710
 first I go to prepare 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.780
 I put the focaccia dough 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.770
 inside the container 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 planetary the fresh yeast of beer goes 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.950
 to add water and a teaspoon of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.230
 sugar meanwhile I dissolve the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.750
 brewer's yeast in the water 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.010
 the yeast has melted it goes to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.530
 add the extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:33.700
 and began to add the flour of 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.700
 semolina and 00 flour in equal parts 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 I insert both flours up to 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 to exhaust the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.439
 and as the last ingredient of a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 gonzÃ¡lez continues to let go 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.549
 kneader for 5 10 minutes until 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.909
 I won't have got a dough but it is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.399
 worked a well kneaded dough 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.380
 worked I go to place it on the floor of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.640
 work 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.229
 I put some flour and my dough 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 I'm going to work it just in time 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:26.340
 necessary to form a dough I go to 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.580
 forming a loaf I put it in a 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:35.220
 container and I go to cover it or like the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.670
 transparent film or cloth 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 clean I do a rest up to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.610
 doubling your volume just 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.100
 the dough will have doubled its own 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:57.390
 volume I transfer it to the plan of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:59.670
 work from a job briefly help me 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.660
 with flour if of course 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.660
 necessary 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.019
 and I'm going to divide it into two equal parts 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:30.489
 I'm going to spread the first disc with a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:35.470
 rolling pin and after laying it I go to 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:47.739
 place on a baking sheet in this case I have 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:50.410
 I chose a round baking pan I took a 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.140
 round baking pan that I arranged for 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:04:02.019
 baking paper over and I go there to 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.829
 distribute or distribute the first disc 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.500
 of pasta 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.549
 the dimensions of the round pan are 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.090
 of 35 cm in diameter 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:17.350
 at this point I'm going to get it 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:20.190
 of cooked ham and I go to 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.190
 to distribute 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.050
 you can put the quantity you want 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:39.460
 I indicatively have given a quantity 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:42.430
 than 150 grams and then I go to put 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.410
 of the smoked rod also here 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.270
 you can choose the type of cheese 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.990
 you can also put st motta 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.150
 sweet or even change the type 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.150
 of cheese according to your tastes 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.790
 at this point it should be spread 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.450
 the other disc of dough goes to arrange 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.450
 over it 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.210
 once even spread of other 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.210
 find them only on top of the focaccia 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.069
 to enlarge it and I go to fix it on 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:45.080
 edges going to just press with i 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:48.349
 fingertips of leisure fingers to press 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.110
 goods so the edges will be well sealed 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.590
 and there will be no risk of it coming out 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.169
 the focaccia filling is now ready 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.690
 missing the last detail go and get 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.180
 extra virgin olive oil and fatah 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.199
 brush the entire surface with a 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.949
 brush now before putting it in 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:14.539
 oven wait ten minutes so 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:21.590
 let the dough relax now 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:24.349
 let's bake and here's the focaccia ready 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.340
 to be served I let it cool a 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:31.009
 now I go to cut and here is the 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.770
 stuffed focaccia baked in the oven with 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.770
 cooked ham and smoked scamorza is 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.080
 a fairly quick recipe can be 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.650
 propose both as a snack and as a dinner 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.139
 fast 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.509
 I hope that this research was also 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.880
 to your liking a kiss to all
