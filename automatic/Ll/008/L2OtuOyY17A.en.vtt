nonsense<00:00:14.990> when<00:00:15.590> you<00:00:15.680> install<00:00:16.010> a<00:00:16.040> game<00:00:16.280> on

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
nonsense when you install a game on

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400 
nonsense when you install a game on
Steam<00:00:16.700> then<00:00:17.030> you<00:00:17.210> can<00:00:17.510> select<00:00:17.900> where<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:18.170> want

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
to install it to this is a very nice

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.120 
to install it to this is a very nice
feature<00:00:20.690> because<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.170> can<00:00:21.350> then<00:00:21.529> install<00:00:21.980> a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
feature because you can then install a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.830 
feature because you can then install a
game<00:00:22.369> on<00:00:22.490> an<00:00:22.610> SSD<00:00:22.730> where<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.360> know<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:23.720> it

game on an SSD where you know that it

game on an SSD where you know that it
will<00:00:23.990> benefit<00:00:24.410> from<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:24.770> additional<00:00:25.100> speed

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
will benefit from the additional speed

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.370 
will benefit from the additional speed
and<00:00:25.700> games<00:00:26.240> way<00:00:26.419> I<00:00:26.450> know<00:00:26.660> that<00:00:26.869> they<00:00:27.080> don't

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.510 
require that speed or games that you
just<00:00:29.840> don't<00:00:30.050> play<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:30.410> often<00:00:30.740> can<00:00:31.369> be

battlefield 4 CTE to my SSD to speed it
up<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.160> bit<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:59.000> what<00:00:59.480> I<00:00:59.510> could<00:00:59.630> do<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.380> use<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
up a bit now what I could do is use the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.530 
up a bit now what I could do is use the
workaround<00:01:01.370> well<00:01:01.550> change<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.180> installation

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
workaround well change the installation

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.109 
workaround well change the installation
directory<00:01:02.960> inside<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.159> origin<00:01:04.610> settings

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
directory inside the origin settings

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.630 
directory inside the origin settings
even<00:01:06.110> though<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:06.350> works<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:06.950> not<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.400> very

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
even though this works it's not a very

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.940 
even though this works it's not a very
nice<00:01:07.880> method<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.780> what<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.290> want<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.680> show<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
nice method so what I want to show you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.460 
nice method so what I want to show you
is<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.310> very<00:01:10.549> elegant<00:01:11.180> way<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.390> move<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.290> game

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
is a very elegant way to move the game

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.140 
is a very elegant way to move the game
to<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> different<00:01:13.130> folder<00:01:13.340> or<00:01:13.670> hard<00:01:13.909> drive

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
to a different folder or hard drive

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.940 
to a different folder or hard drive
where<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.960> do<00:01:15.140> not<00:01:15.289> have<00:01:15.469> to<00:01:15.590> mess<00:01:15.770> around

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
where you do not have to mess around

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.910 
where you do not have to mess around
with<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.549> settings<00:01:16.969> inside<00:01:17.390> origin<00:01:17.990> what<00:01:18.829> we

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
with the settings inside origin what we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.889 
with the settings inside origin what we
will<00:01:19.070> do<00:01:19.219> is<00:01:19.460> take<00:01:19.850> use<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.359> feature<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.689> is

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
will do is take use of a feature that is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.590 
will do is take use of a feature that is
provided<00:01:21.409> by<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.649> NTFS<00:01:22.520> file<00:01:22.820> system<00:01:22.850> which

is<00:01:23.749> called<00:01:24.049> junction<00:01:24.740> point<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.999> is<00:01:26.149> not

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
is called junction point so this is not

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.760 
is called junction point so this is not
a<00:01:26.329> heck<00:01:26.539> or<00:01:26.749> something<00:01:27.229> we<00:01:27.469> will<00:01:27.619> use<00:01:27.740> a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
a heck or something we will use a

drop<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.530> function<00:03:34.150> what<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.269> have<00:03:35.450> here<00:03:35.600> now

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
drop as function what we have here now

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.990 
drop as function what we have here now
looks<00:03:36.110> like<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.380> normal<00:03:36.680> Windows<00:03:37.190> shortcut<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
looks like a normal Windows shortcut and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.060 
looks like a normal Windows shortcut and
that's<00:03:38.299> basically<00:03:38.810> also<00:03:39.080> what<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.350> junction<00:03:39.799> is

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
that's basically also what a junction is

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.400 
that's basically also what a junction is
but<00:03:40.549> unlike<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.150> Windows<00:03:41.450> shortcut<00:03:41.989> this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
but unlike the Windows shortcut this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.860 
but unlike the Windows shortcut this
Junction<00:03:42.920> act<00:03:43.130> like<00:03:43.489> an<00:03:43.850> alias<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.600> that

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
Junction act like an alias of that

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.710 
Junction act like an alias of that
directory<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.640> folder<00:03:47.000> looks<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.540> works

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
directory so this folder looks and works

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.380 
directory so this folder looks and works
like<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.260> located<00:03:48.650> on<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.010> e<00:03:49.040> hard<00:03:49.549> disk<00:03:49.820> but

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
like it's located on the e hard disk but

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.059 
like it's located on the e hard disk but
it's<00:03:50.540> actually<00:03:50.989> located<00:03:51.410> on<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.799> SSD
