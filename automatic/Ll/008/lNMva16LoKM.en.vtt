I<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.990> this<00:03:14.380> start<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:15.070> bleeding<00:03:15.490> about<00:03:16.110> 40

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
I want this start of bleeding about 40

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.460 
I want this start of bleeding about 40
frame<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.850> basically<00:03:19.360> one<00:03:19.900> second

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
frame here so it's basically one second

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.230 
frame here so it's basically one second
and<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:21.580> will<00:03:22.570> end<00:03:22.840> reading<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.890> ad<00:03:25.380> ad<00:03:26.380> frame

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
and it will end reading an ad ad frame

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.220 
and it will end reading an ad ad frame
so<00:03:28.240> somewhere<00:03:28.660> here

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
so somewhere here

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.340 
so somewhere here
alright<00:03:29.770> so<00:03:30.010> let's<00:03:30.280> play<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:32.260> your

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
alright so let's play it for your

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.670 
alright so let's play it for your
friends<00:03:32.710> here<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.780> ending<00:03:35.230> on<00:03:35.440> a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
friends here and it's ending on a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.229 
friends here and it's ending on a
different<00:03:36.100> move

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.080 

as<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.890> virtual<00:03:41.670> floor

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
as you can see there is a virtual floor

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.360 
as you can see there is a virtual floor
look<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:44.370> makes<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> dynamics<00:03:47.640> effect

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
look that makes the dynamics effect

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.500 
look that makes the dynamics effect
alright<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.849> some<00:03:51.180> more<00:03:51.599> ceilings<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:53.510> can

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
alright so some more ceilings you can

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.229 
alright so some more ceilings you can
also<00:03:54.780> change<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:57.409> change<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.590> block<00:03:58.859> mm<00:03:59.400> so

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
also change the change the block mm so

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.410 
also change the change the block mm so
now<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.480> have<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:02.420> 150<00:04:03.420> blocks<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.980> block<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.390> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
now I have a 150 blocks or block so I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.559 
now I have a 150 blocks or block so I
can<00:04:06.720> change<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.200> about<00:04:07.849> 60<00:04:09.650> right<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.569> there

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
can change it to about 60 right so there

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.450 
can change it to about 60 right so there
you<00:04:12.629> go

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
you go

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.950 
you go
or<00:04:14.550> huge<00:04:15.240> mo<00:04:15.570> above<00:04:16.580> 300<00:04:18.260> like<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.590> move<00:04:20.930> okay

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
or huge mo above 300 like this move okay

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.500 
or huge mo above 300 like this move okay
you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.590> change<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:23.070> block<00:04:23.310> speed<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.360> it

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
you can change the block speed so it

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.800 
you can change the block speed so it
will<00:04:24.690> be<00:04:24.840> more<00:04:25.140> spirits<00:04:26.180> like<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.200> will

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
will be more spirits like so so it will

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.410 
will be more spirits like so so it will
split<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:33.510> more<00:04:33.840> distance

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
split to more distance

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.160 
split to more distance
okay<00:04:36.760> all<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:38.840> five<00:04:39.170> or<00:04:39.470> six<00:04:39.770> no<00:04:41.170> it's

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
okay all about five or six no it's

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.800 
okay all about five or six no it's
simple<00:04:44.980> No

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
simple No

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.230 
simple No
also<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.860> change<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.400> amount<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.880> want<00:04:50.120> to

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
also I change the amount I want to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.240 
also I change the amount I want to
change<00:04:50.420> just<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.680> steep<00:04:52.210> amount<00:04:53.210> about

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
change just is the steep amount about

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.820 
change just is the steep amount about
100<00:04:55.750> okay<00:04:58.210> Bo

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
100 okay Bo

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.140 
100 okay Bo
you<00:05:01.400> can<00:05:01.550> also<00:05:01.930> turn<00:05:02.930> off<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.620> dynamics<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:04.970> it

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
you can also turn off the dynamics so it

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.430 
you can also turn off the dynamics so it
will<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:06.530> will<00:05:07.129> just<00:05:07.460> fall<00:05:07.759> down<00:05:08.530> like<00:05:09.530> this<00:05:09.800> or

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
will it will just fall down like this or

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.700 
will it will just fall down like this or
yeah<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.770> dynamic<00:05:13.310> ground<00:05:13.610> like<00:05:14.569> so<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.560> it

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
yeah the dynamic ground like so so it

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.469 
yeah the dynamic ground like so so it
will<00:05:15.949> fall<00:05:16.280> down<00:05:16.310> but<00:05:16.879> there's<00:05:17.539> no<00:05:17.870> ground

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
will fall down but there's no ground

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.040 
will fall down but there's no ground
okay<00:05:21.159> so<00:05:22.159> I<00:05:22.190> think<00:05:22.340> that's<00:05:22.729> all<00:05:22.909> for<00:05:23.629> this<00:05:23.750> rig

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
okay so I think that's all for this rig

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.850 
okay so I think that's all for this rig
so<00:05:24.409> I<00:05:24.440> hope<00:05:24.979> this<00:05:25.400> tutorial<00:05:25.669> helped<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.860> if
