does pick up a lot I don't love it for
loose<00:02:18.160> powder<00:02:18.490> because<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> picks<00:02:19.450> up

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
loose powder because it just picks up

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.140 
loose powder because it just picks up
way<00:02:20.020> too<00:02:20.080> much<00:02:20.290> for<00:02:20.650> loose<00:02:20.800> powder<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.370> too

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
way too much for loose powder it's too

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.930 
way too much for loose powder it's too
dense<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.840> flat<00:02:23.320> picks<00:02:23.800> up<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.280> lot<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
dense it's flat picks up just a lot of

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.280 
dense it's flat picks up just a lot of
powder<00:02:25.120> too<00:02:25.390> much<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.780> then<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> pick<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.230> up

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
powder too much and then you pick it up

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.380 
powder too much and then you pick it up
you<00:02:26.500> put<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.040> your<00:02:27.190> face<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:28.240> like

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
you put on your face and I just be like

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.510 
you put on your face and I just be like
it<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.350> just<00:02:29.590> sticks<00:02:29.830> right<00:02:30.100> where<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.340> put<00:02:30.490> it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
it it just sticks right where you put it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.310 
it it just sticks right where you put it
like<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.240> pick<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:31.990> goes<00:02:32.140> right

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
like if you pick up just goes right

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.760 
like if you pick up just goes right
there<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.910> hard<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> like<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.620> end

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
there so it's hard to like you just end

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.470 
there so it's hard to like you just end
up<00:02:35.830> using<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.490> much<00:02:36.610> powder<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.210> get<00:02:37.360> your

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
up using so much powder to get your

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.910 
up using so much powder to get your
whole<00:02:37.600> face<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.230> brush<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.710> don't

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
whole face with this brush so I don't

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.040 
whole face with this brush so I don't
like<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.190> for<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> loose<00:02:39.520> powder<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.810> used

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
like it for a loose powder I have used

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.520 
like it for a loose powder I have used
it<00:02:41.290> for<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.540> packed<00:02:43.540> powder<00:02:43.720> before<00:02:43.990> which<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.470> do

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
it for a packed powder before which I do

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.670 
it for a packed powder before which I do
like<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:46.150> picks<00:02:46.420> up<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.870> perfect<00:02:47.200> amount<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
like it picks up the perfect amount that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140 
like it picks up the perfect amount that
I<00:02:47.710> feel<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.520> need<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.970> like

foundation even if I just like take some

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.130 
foundation even if I just like take some
foundation<00:03:08.920> my<00:03:09.010> hands<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.610> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
foundation my hands go like this and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010 
foundation my hands go like this and
then<00:03:11.140> smooth<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.670> doesn't<00:03:13.420> smooth

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
then smooth this in it doesn't smooth

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.020 
then smooth this in it doesn't smooth
enough<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.530> it'll<00:03:14.860> get<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:15.820> if<00:03:15.940> I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
enough like it'll get it here but if I

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.490 
enough like it'll get it here but if I
try<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.360> bring<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.720> up<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.050> doesn't<00:03:17.170> really

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
try and bring it up it doesn't really

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.150 
try and bring it up it doesn't really
bring<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.190> up<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.700> way<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.120> want<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.540> uh

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
bring it up the way that I want to uh

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.990 
bring it up the way that I want to uh
maybe<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.519> foundations<00:03:21.970> that

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
maybe it's just the foundations that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.640 
maybe it's just the foundations that
were<00:03:22.180> using<00:03:22.360> they<00:03:22.570> were<00:03:22.660> thicker<00:03:23.050> foundations

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
were using they were thicker foundations

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.420 
were using they were thicker foundations
when<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.250> use<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.670> with<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.120> watery<00:03:25.690> or

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
when I use this with a watery or

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.860 
when I use this with a watery or
foundation<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.940> works<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.330> better<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.840> I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
foundation it works a lot better so I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.740 
foundation it works a lot better so I
would<00:03:29.140> say<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:30.370> doesn't<00:03:30.700> work<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.269> greatest

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
would say this doesn't work the greatest

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
would say this doesn't work the greatest
for<00:03:32.080> thicker<00:03:32.590> foundations<00:03:33.220> creamy<00:03:34.150> you're

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
for thicker foundations creamy you're

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.509 
for thicker foundations creamy you're
heavier<00:03:34.690> foundations<00:03:35.290> more<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.160> liquidy

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
heavier foundations more with liquidy

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.880 
heavier foundations more with liquidy
foundations<00:03:37.060> like<00:03:37.780> BB<00:03:38.110> cream<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.500> really<00:03:38.769> like
