rolls<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.470> cockpit<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.160> here<00:03:42.400> does<00:03:42.700> turn<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
rolls the cockpit up here does turn it

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.390 
rolls the cockpit up here does turn it
does<00:03:43.780> swivel<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:45.040> as<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.780> front<00:03:47.080> tank<00:03:47.860> it
