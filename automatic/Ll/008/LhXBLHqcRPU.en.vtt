complaint<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:53.530> far<00:03:53.769> about<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.159> layout<00:03:54.489> here

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
complaint so far about the layout here

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.509 
complaint so far about the layout here
is<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:57.629> speaker<00:03:59.099> cable<00:04:00.099> assembly

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
is this is the speaker cable assembly

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.660 
is this is the speaker cable assembly
right<00:04:00.670> there<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:02.530> kind<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.890> draped

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
right there that is just kind of draped

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.900 
right there that is just kind of draped
over<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.360> heatsink<00:04:05.019> pipe<00:04:05.680> there<00:04:06.040> runs<00:04:06.670> up

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
over the heatsink pipe there runs up

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.850 
over the heatsink pipe there runs up
there<00:04:07.120> tapes<00:04:07.840> there<00:04:08.140> runs<00:04:08.560> down<00:04:08.829> here

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
there tapes there runs down here

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.390 
there tapes there runs down here
underneath<00:04:09.400> here<00:04:09.879> and<00:04:10.709> there<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.860> know<00:04:15.160> from

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
underneath here and there I I know from

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.819 
underneath here and there I I know from
experience<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:16.030> heat<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:18.269> wire<00:04:19.650> don't<00:04:20.650> go

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
experience that heat and wire don't go

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.969 
experience that heat and wire don't go
together<00:04:21.030> especially<00:04:22.030> over<00:04:22.539> time<00:04:22.949> so<00:04:23.949> I

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
together especially over time so I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.920 
together especially over time so I
checked<00:04:24.610> with<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.880> Dell<00:04:25.060> Tech's<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.780> they

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
checked with the Dell Tech's and they

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.170 
checked with the Dell Tech's and they
assure<00:04:26.229> me<00:04:26.410> that's<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:27.520> routing<00:04:27.910> from<00:04:28.090> the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
assure me that's the routing from the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.820 
assure me that's the routing from the
factory<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.020> guess<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.470> know<00:04:29.500> if<00:04:29.680> these

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
factory and I guess you know if these

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.560 
factory and I guess you know if these
stickers<00:04:30.190> can<00:04:30.550> hold<00:04:30.789> up<00:04:30.940> on<00:04:31.120> here<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.360> guess

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
stickers can hold up on here I guess

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.000 
stickers can hold up on here I guess
we'll<00:04:31.750> see<00:04:31.930> how<00:04:31.960> well<00:04:32.229> these<00:04:32.410> speaker<00:04:32.800> wires

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
we'll see how well these speaker wires

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.540 
we'll see how well these speaker wires
hold<00:04:33.340> up<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.930> other<00:04:35.560> than<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.190> system

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
hold up so other than that the system

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.050 
hold up so other than that the system
seems<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.479> salad<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:37.990> other<00:04:38.550> 6500<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.699> so

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
seems the salad is the other 6500 and so

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.650 
seems the salad is the other 6500 and so
forth<00:04:40.330> Siri<00:04:40.600> seems<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.199> so<00:04:42.330> can't<00:04:43.330> wait<00:04:43.479> to

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
forth Siri seems to be so can't wait to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.960 
forth Siri seems to be so can't wait to
get<00:04:43.780> this<00:04:43.930> one<00:04:44.139> ready<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.710> get<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.490> out<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.849> the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
get this one ready and get it out to the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.889 
get this one ready and get it out to the
employee<00:04:46.440> thanks<00:04:47.440> for<00:04:47.560> watching
