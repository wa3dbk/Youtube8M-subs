00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello very good everyone I'm fury we go 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.959
 to see the possible achievements and trophies I say 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 possible because this has leaked 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.189
 there's nothing official yet I have not 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 could really check the list of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.270
 trophies until it appears on the map 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 obviously, but it looks like 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.489
 be true if we are going to see them 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.219
 continuation as background break the cycle 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.510
 and in dfu the deep mode breaks the cycle 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.219
 completes the cycle three times 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 next is emotion the deep improvement 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.520
 all the traps before round 10 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 we will know that we can improve the traps 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 I do not know how later we'll see that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 we can have a kit to improve the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.839
 weapons regularly gets this here not 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.120
 I know we will have to wait until the 16th for 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.399
 see him 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.040
 the next trophy will be emotion of 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.719
 pass a round 15 higher but it does 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 reference to a bridge we will not know if 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.920
 this image corresponds to the end of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.070
 stereo or that we can go to a new 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.070
 zone 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.290
 open doors without spending points either 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.670
 we know nothing about it can be that 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.200
 in after life mode we can open 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.509
 doors pulling sparks 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.130
 the next trophy of the tradition of 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.780
 with nine lives so it's clear to the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.340
 reload we will jump sparks and it will be done 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.460
 Kill 10 zombies with this new 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 brutus advantage completes his patrol 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.500
 well this we see that it deactivates the advantage 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.330
 or do something will surely turn off 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.659
 all the advantages or something like that 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.190
 with this new zombie boss the mode 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.409
 that turns a weapon using a foot is 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.670
 here in the first trailer we saw the gun 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.380
 and then we saw the improved weapon 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 surely we have a kit to improve 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.240
 the weapon part of the pack to punch 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.060
 get the infernal tomahawk when 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.290
 says the boss or retriver he takes water 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.540
 this one that we saw in the second trailer that 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.400
 you will have in the description surely 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.010
 will be feeding the beast won a 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.830
 eating zombies the infernal dog 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.020

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.330
 new tomahawk and finally run the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.980
 escape plan he has all the looks of 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.950
 be the moose that execute the plan of 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.040
 escape that we saw in the in the first 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.020
 trailer and we'll have to wait until day 16 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.580
