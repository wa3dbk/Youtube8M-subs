the Indian Road man see another one nano
gear<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.720> I'm<00:01:29.810> choosing<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.290> Nano

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.390 

I'm<00:01:33.850> gonna<00:01:34.270> beat<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.720> up<00:01:34.830> my<00:01:35.830> god<00:01:36.190> my
