was the very first Pokemon game I had
and<00:00:32.989> my<00:00:33.470> parents<00:00:33.770> bought<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.160> for<00:00:34.309> me<00:00:34.399> because

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
and my parents bought it for me because

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.979 
and my parents bought it for me because
they<00:00:34.760> didn't<00:00:34.940> know<00:00:34.970> anything<00:00:35.059> about<00:00:35.390> Pokemon

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
they didn't know anything about Pokemon

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.900 
they didn't know anything about Pokemon
and<00:00:36.170> then<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:36.440> eventually<00:00:36.980> traded<00:00:37.490> that<00:00:37.730> in

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
and then we eventually traded that in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.070 
and then we eventually traded that in
for<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> red<00:00:38.510> version<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:40.210> even<00:00:41.210> then<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.660> still

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080
