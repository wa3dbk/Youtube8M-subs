00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
that's hard like what's really good is

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.480 
that's hard like what's really good is
that<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.229> she<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.679> tries<00:01:34.950> she<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.399> do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that when she really tries she can do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.279 
that when she really tries she can do
like<00:01:35.520> speed<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> hard<00:01:37.140> for

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
like speed was something was hard for

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.169 
like speed was something was hard for
her<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.499> get<00:01:37.649> like<00:01:37.859> she<00:01:38.100> couldn't<00:01:38.490> improve<00:01:38.969> it

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
her to get like she couldn't improve it

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.779 
her to get like she couldn't improve it
but<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:40.020> last<00:01:40.259> session<00:01:40.530> she<00:01:41.219> wanted<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
but like the last session she wanted so

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.849 
but like the last session she wanted so
bad<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> pass<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.530> reason<00:01:43.770> she

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
bad to pass there for some reason she

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.300 
bad to pass there for some reason she
blew<00:01:44.249> it<00:01:44.280> alive<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.679> she<00:01:46.890> really

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
blew it alive so it's like if she really

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.849 
blew it alive so it's like if she really
tried<00:01:47.609> I<00:01:47.909> don't<00:01:48.509> doubt<00:01:48.749> that<00:01:48.810> she<00:01:49.289> could<00:01:49.710> do

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
tried I don't doubt that she could do

00:01:49.859 --> 00:02:03.800 
tried I don't doubt that she could do
whatever
