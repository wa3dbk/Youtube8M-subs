00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
situations and I can't imagine anything

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.170 
situations and I can't imagine anything
more<00:00:50.559> exciting<00:00:50.860> than<00:00:51.160> competing<00:00:51.700> at<00:00:51.910> home

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
more exciting than competing at home

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.820 
more exciting than competing at home
Olympics<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.809> having<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.200> opportunity<00:00:53.440> to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
Olympics and having the opportunity to

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.350 
Olympics and having the opportunity to
stand<00:00:54.040> on<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.280> podium<00:00:54.400> sure<00:00:55.030> while<00:00:55.239> you're

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
stand on the podium sure while you're

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.310 
stand on the podium sure while you're
still<00:00:55.450> in<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.600> podium<00:00:55.840> last<00:00:55.989> time<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.290> the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
still in the podium last time with the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.710 
still in the podium last time with the
bronze<00:00:56.559> medal<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:57.790> have<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.180> first<00:00:58.450> one

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
bronze medal so you have that first one

bronze medal so you have that first one
so<00:00:59.199> I'm<00:00:59.260> wondering<00:00:59.350> if<00:00:59.589> that<00:00:59.710> quest<00:01:00.010> for<00:01:00.250> the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
so I'm wondering if that quest for the

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.640 
so I'm wondering if that quest for the
first<00:01:00.610> one<00:01:00.879> versus<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.900> almost

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
first one versus the the almost

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.220 
first one versus the the almost
addictive<00:01:03.519> feeling<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.970> one<00:01:04.089> another<00:01:04.390> what

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
addictive feeling to one another what

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.750 
addictive feeling to one another what
was<00:01:05.379> harder<00:01:05.620> for<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.890> or<00:01:06.190> what<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.520> harder

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
was harder for you or what is harder
