testing tell me when the right way so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.529 
testing tell me when the right way so
first<00:00:26.340> off<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> says<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> kill<00:00:27.330> an<00:00:27.449> enemy

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
frost or unholy presence your next death

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
frost or unholy presence your next death
strike<00:00:32.579> within<00:00:32.759> 15<00:00:33.239> seconds<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> free<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
max health so basically what this means

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
max health so basically what this means
is<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:40.020> need<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.469> either<00:00:40.590> frost<00:00:40.950> or

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is you need to be in either frost or

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
is you need to be in either frost or
unholy<00:00:41.520> presence<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.090> you're<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.360> blood<00:00:42.600> it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
unholy presence if you're in blood it's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
unholy presence if you're in blood it's
not<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.379> anything<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.950> need<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
not going to do anything you need to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.959 
not going to do anything you need to
land<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.510> killing<00:00:45.960> blow<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
land the killing blow so if you are in a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.400 
land the killing blow so if you are in a
battleground<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.780> something<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.200> someone

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
battleground or something and someone

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
battleground or something and someone
else<00:00:49.649> lands<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> killing<00:00:50.309> blow<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.730> don't

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
else lands the killing blow I don't

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
else lands the killing blow I don't
think<00:00:51.329> it'll<00:00:51.629> give<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> proc<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.699> then

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
think it'll give you the proc and then

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.479 
think it'll give you the proc and then
the<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.930> other<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> course<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the the other thing is of course that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
the the other thing is of course that
they<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.840> around<00:00:58.140> about

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they need to be pretty much around about

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
they need to be pretty much around about
the<00:00:58.440> same<00:00:58.530> level<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.910> you're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the same level as you because if you're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
the same level as you because if you're
hitting<00:01:00.300> something<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> gray<00:01:01.170> mob<00:01:01.469> then

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hitting something that's a gray mob then

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
hitting something that's a gray mob then
it's<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.149> trigger<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:03.989> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it's not going to trigger and if you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
it's not going to trigger and if you're
hitting<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> person<00:01:04.890> who's<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.250> 20<00:01:05.519> levels

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
hitting a person who's like 20 levels

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
hitting a person who's like 20 levels
lower<00:01:05.970> than<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> guess<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.530> not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lower than you guess what you're not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
lower than you guess what you're not
going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.159> getting<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.549> glyph<00:01:08.820> proc<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
going to be getting this glyph proc and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.520 
going to be getting this glyph proc and
if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> glyph<00:01:10.049> proc<00:01:10.350> while

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
if you need the glyph proc while

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
if you need the glyph proc while
fighting<00:01:10.770> someone<00:01:11.159> 20<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> 30<00:01:11.820> levels<00:01:12.180> lower

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
fighting someone 20 to 30 levels lower

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.200 
fighting someone 20 to 30 levels lower
than<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.189> maybe<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.909> need<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
than you I think that maybe you need to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.789 
than you I think that maybe you need to
look<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.869> else<00:01:16.430> okay<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.500> before<00:01:19.500> we

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
look at something else okay so before we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
look at something else okay so before we
go<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> start<00:01:20.520> setting<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.150> actually

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
go and start setting it up I actually

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
go and start setting it up I actually
have<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.680> proc<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> called

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
have a look at what this proc is called

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
have a look at what this proc is called
to<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.700> sure<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.540> correctly

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to make sure we have that all correctly

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.219 
to make sure we have that all correctly
so<00:01:25.740> let's<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> beat<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> bird<00:01:27.229> hello
