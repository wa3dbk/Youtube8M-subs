00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
drilled from the ground though it was

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.960 
drilled from the ground though it was
manufactured<00:00:07.560> by<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.069> companies<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.760> say

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
manufactured by the companies you say

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.740 
manufactured by the companies you say
here<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.290> tiny<00:00:10.679> little<00:00:11.460> unit<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.570> an

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
here and this tiny little unit on an

so<00:00:15.089> like<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.330> say<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> question<00:00:16.199> today<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.650> if

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
so like you say the question today is if

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.910 
so like you say the question today is if
this<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.760> manufactured<00:00:18.590> could<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> help

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this can be manufactured could it help

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.910 
this can be manufactured could it help
in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.609> battle<00:00:20.910> against<00:00:21.330> climate<00:00:21.689> change

in the battle against climate change

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
in the battle against climate change
could<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.130> helped<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.609> solve<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.420> world's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
could it be helped to solve the world's

how<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.359> made<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:28.439> come<00:00:28.619> inside<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.189> unit

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
how it's made we come inside this unit

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
how it's made we come inside this unit
here<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> glasses<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.019> clearly<00:00:31.349> I'm

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
here the glasses are on so clearly I'm

here the glasses are on so clearly I'm
going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.740> talking<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.279> science<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
going to be talking some science this is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
going to be talking some science this is
methanol<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.260> tank<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.649> which<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
methanol in this tank here which the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.700 
methanol in this tank here which the
company<00:00:35.670> has<00:00:35.930> manufactured<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.110> mixed<00:00:37.590> with

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
company has manufactured it's mixed with

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
company has manufactured it's mixed with
something<00:00:38.070> called<00:00:38.250> DME<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.140> an

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
something called DME which is an

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
something called DME which is an
alternative<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> diesel<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> used<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
alternative to diesel that is used to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
alternative to diesel that is used to
fuel<00:00:42.540> things<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.379> public<00:00:43.829> transport<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
fuel things like public transport in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
fuel things like public transport in
places<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:44.969> Sweden<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.289> distilled<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
places like Sweden is then distilled and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.540 
places like Sweden is then distilled and
this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> where<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.989> fuel<00:00:49.230> comes<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this is where the fuel comes out of this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.479 
this is where the fuel comes out of this
tank<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.600> let's<00:00:52.260> speak<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.280> chief

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
tank here let's speak now to the chief

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
tank here let's speak now to the chief
executive<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.629> company<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.230> Peter

executive of the company here Peter

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.369 
executive of the company here Peter
Harrison<00:00:56.510> efficiency<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
Harrison efficiency this is what the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
Harrison efficiency this is what the
scientists<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:59.250> asking<00:00:59.460> today<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.020> heard

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
scientists are asking today as we heard

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
scientists are asking today as we heard
a<00:01:01.199> minute<00:01:01.440> ago<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.890> sounds<00:01:02.399> too<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.090> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a minute ago it sounds too good to be

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
a minute ago it sounds too good to be
true<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.899> how<00:01:04.199> long<00:01:04.350> does<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.339> say

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
true so how long does it take to say

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.140 
true so how long does it take to say
make<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.479> liter<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.439> fuel<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.340> unique<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
make a liter of this fuel the unique we

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
make a liter of this fuel the unique we
have<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> demonstration<00:01:10.049> facility<00:01:11.000> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
have here is a demonstration facility so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
have here is a demonstration facility so
we'll<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.390> using<00:01:12.570> existing<00:01:12.930> technology<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we'll be using existing technology to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.440 
we'll be using existing technology to
bring<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> together<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
bring all this together and to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
bring all this together and to
demonstrate<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.009> these

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
demonstrate that we can make all these

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
demonstrate that we can make all these
processes<00:01:17.850> work<00:01:18.090> together<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.640> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
processes work together so this is not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
processes work together so this is not
an<00:01:20.909> efficient<00:01:21.360> sight<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.380> something

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
an efficient sight that is something

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
an efficient sight that is something
that<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.070> develop<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> next<00:01:24.030> project

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that we will develop in the next project

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600 
that we will develop in the next project
I<00:01:24.720> guess<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.350> evaluating<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:26.280> good

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I guess when you're evaluating how good

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
I guess when you're evaluating how good
it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:27.270> something<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> look

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it is that's something you have to look

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.340 
it is that's something you have to look
at<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.680> how<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.310> cost<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> far

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
at so how much is all this cost so far

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
at so how much is all this cost so far
we<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:32.040> year<00:01:32.310> project<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.060> we've

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
we have had a two year project and we've

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
we have had a two year project and we've
invested<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.290> million<00:01:34.680> pounds<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.460> where

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
invested a million pounds to get where

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.469 
invested a million pounds to get where
we<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.790> today<00:01:36.650> what's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> next<00:01:37.890> step<00:01:38.479> right

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
we are today what's the next step right

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
we are today what's the next step right
well<00:01:39.750> we've<00:01:39.869> got<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> design<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> one

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
well we've got a design now for a one

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
well we've got a design now for a one
ton<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> day<00:01:41.640> unit<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.869> three

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

that<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.220> us<00:02:27.340> here<00:02:27.700> today<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.510> there<00:02:29.350> may<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
that to us here today so there may be a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
that to us here today so there may be a
long<00:02:29.770> way<00:02:29.800> off<00:02:30.160> yet<00:02:30.460> before<00:02:30.790> we<00:02:30.880> start<00:02:31.150> putting

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
long way off yet before we start putting

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
long way off yet before we start putting
this<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:32.020> our<00:02:32.530> cars<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.370> clearly<00:02:33.730> what<00:02:33.850> they

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
this in our cars but clearly what they

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.210 
this in our cars but clearly what they
are<00:02:34.060> saying<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.480> T<00:02:34.690> side<00:02:34.990> today<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.010> isn't

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
are saying on T side today is this isn't

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.790 
are saying on T side today is this isn't
production<00:02:37.210> it's<00:02:37.420> demonstration<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.590> let's

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
production it's demonstration so let's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.550 
production it's demonstration so let's
try<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:40.150> what<00:02:40.360> we<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.510> created<00:02:40.810> here<00:02:41.170> -

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
try and use what we have created here -

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.070 
try and use what we have created here -
perhaps<00:02:41.800> solve<00:02:42.310> energy<00:02:43.180> problems<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
perhaps solve energy problems in the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.230 
perhaps solve energy problems in the
future
