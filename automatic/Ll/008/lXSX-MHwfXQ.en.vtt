00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.450
 great fighters with you 3d and today we have 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.519
 regular lips life 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.740
 full review of such 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.920
 to a wonderful heavy tank 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.640
 if not to say u like t-35 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.650
 so guys look throws us on 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.300
 map of poland on which of course in 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.669
 the city I did not push for that simple 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.820
 the reason is that with our mobility do 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.059
 there is absolutely nothing but i'm poper 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.040
 just across the field immediately to the capture point 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.290
 enemy bases using high 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.810
 the survivability rate of your car and so 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.710
 here is our first goal of the stage for 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.730
 four modifications c stop 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.620
 calmly on enter your main 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.910
 caliber on the enemy tank and do 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.080
 just falling 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 the enemy rolls back 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.170
 making a shot to 45 liters cannon and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.120
 destroy only radio operator 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.479
 oh-oh-oh our opponent managed to leave 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 from inevitable death well well we continue 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.880
 we are moving on the map in order 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.509
 to be as close as possible to ours 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.609
 to the enemy and so we can say so 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.229
 convenient to shoot with the main cannon 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.700
 which horrible flight paths 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.429
 projectile seen by his counterpart who 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.539
 very and very carefully substitutes 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.069
 to your board 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.829
 again stop aiming and 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.679
 with a shot from 76 meter gun we set fire 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.289
 the enemy's tank can be seen escaping 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.289
 building last night ass German tanker 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.060
 will mark that again the path is free and we 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.880
 moving forward 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.130
 we break trees greenpeace does not approve but 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.539
 where to go war is war see on 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.549
 map marker of our enduring pandora 4 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.490
 but I just can not find with her 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.259
 eye contact coverage is he checking 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.509
 own kebab on readiness 2 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.639
 shots well, in principle, yes roasting 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.999
 good steak turned out great 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:10.690
 more precisely schnitzel in our conditions and right there 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:13.030
 notice one more panzar 4 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 make a shot at him and again only 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.740
 only hits but this opponent 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.680
 turned out to be more stubborn therefore just 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.400
 stands still well to know 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.739
 suddenly the commander stands on you in 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.840
 gunner and loader worth yes and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.180
 here's another one for mehvod 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 endured quietly in three shots we 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.409
 whole crew 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 have this stubborn German tanker 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.209
 and we go on and somewhere far away in a haze 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.859
 we notice another enemy tank 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.840
 sighting shot undershoot what 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.739
 annoying recharge fast enough yet 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.750
 shot and the target is not damaged oyoi 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.250
 the enemy is already beginning to think probably 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.919
 it's getting dangerous unfortunately 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.099
 flies over our third projectile and cut in 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.609
 we turn our 45 mm cannon 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.379
 left 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:09.900
 battery in battle tube 15 sight 120 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:12.780
 battery fire and point in great style 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 we are taking in our third frag simply 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.200
 tore a boy away from so much 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.000
 attention from so much and 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.829
 great tank well 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.139
 keep moving forward with you 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.909
 uses tactical scope which 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.540
 we are by the way ourselves and 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.280
 organized will do in a few minuses 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.409
 enemy machines of their own with one 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.689
 the simple goal is to tighten up 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.629
 close up to respawn at the enemy 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:42.000
 to dagger in melee 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:47.129
 if you will, and so it is convenient to spread 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.930
 the remnants of the enemy forces to the maximum 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.030
 close u roll back to positions 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 the enemy and see what's left of us 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.069
 rolls out a very tricky flank 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.639
 rounds we beat him right off the caterpillar and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.250
 see how in beautiful tango rotates 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.040
 around its axis German tank on one 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.579
 caterpillar and we, in turn, thank 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.259
 and in every way we cheer with our shells 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.720
 our opponent is so handsome 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:15.900
 dance and of course he in turn does not 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.090
 gives us another frag in the t-35 piggy bank 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.359
 thank you talk about big and roll 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.000
 farther in literally in the next box 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.750
 we already have several goals ahead 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.599
 our great friend voracious well 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.810
 what are the guys and now according to our method 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.570
 great teacher hello tankers with you 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.029
 40 tons we will study with you 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.580
 Throw our shells to the enemy for 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.710
 mound and now our first goal is a little 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.690
 one can see the commander's turret pd20 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.110
 Throw in it we fall from razukrasim entire 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.120
 crew 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.349
 second shot unfortunately not penetration 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.690
 water is charging the third projectile 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.729
 which becomes fatal to the lung 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.270
 enemy tank but not relax 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.349
 pz 4 and drive to the right 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.669
 I miss and I slept commander 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.320
 the turret of the enemy machine trying 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.169
 fix the error using 45 meters 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.260
 guns fail tank shells and already 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.270
 on the leaving enemy I'm shooting back 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.130
 and such get into the ill-fated 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.320
 commander's cupola but right there on the left 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.659
 on the left thickets lit marker 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.460
 medium tank another medium tank 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.370
 the enemy is unable to notice him 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.909
 through thickets but can be seen 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.860
 square case 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.360
 the enemy machine immediately we derive 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.729
 driver-radio operator from 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.860
 building trying to finish it right there 0 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.469
 only hitting us is haunted with 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.659
 With the help of 45 liters of cue, we set fire to 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.339
 knock out the gunner from the enemy's tank 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.789
 but he is moving away 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:41.940
 moves back and offhand already through 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.580
 thickets we still finish off the enemy tank 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.159
 Well, guys, this battle can 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.620
 be considered as finished because 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.279
 more nimble allies overtook ours 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.300
 sloupochny t-35 and such ate the remains 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:59.060
 enemy team well and you were 3 before
