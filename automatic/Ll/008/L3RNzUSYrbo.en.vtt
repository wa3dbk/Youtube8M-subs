00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
of read and how to prefer a read I

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.020 
of read and how to prefer a read I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.549 
actually use Van Doren's v12 mostly I
have<00:00:12.540> been<00:00:12.690> using<00:00:12.840> them<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.200> long<00:00:13.349> time

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
have been using them for a long time

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.039 
have been using them for a long time
Bingley<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.030> consistency<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.630> sound

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
Bingley because the consistency of sound

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
Bingley because the consistency of sound
and<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.830> consistency<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> quality<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and the consistency of the quality of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.140 
and the consistency of the quality of
the<00:00:18.090> Kane<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.449> been<00:00:18.630> very<00:00:19.439> good<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.430> always

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the Kane has been very good and I always

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.400 
the Kane has been very good and I always
I<00:00:21.420> loved<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.740> part<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> process<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.930> one

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
I loved that part of the process now one

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.810 
I loved that part of the process now one
of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> things<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> remember

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
of the things that we have to remember

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.560 
of the things that we have to remember
is<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.689> piece<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.050> cane<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:29.150> really<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
is that the piece of cane is really a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.370 
is that the piece of cane is really a
living<00:00:31.320> matter<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> piece<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
living matter and when we get a piece of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.440 
living matter and when we get a piece of
wood<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.070> actually<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.120> start

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
wood like this and actually we start

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
wood like this and actually we start
applying<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.829> starts<00:00:38.160> decaying

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
applying it on it it starts decaying

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
applying it on it it starts decaying
because<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> acidity<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> saliva<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
because of the acidity of the saliva so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.970 
because of the acidity of the saliva so
you<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> try<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:42.450> sure<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.770> get

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you have to try to make sure that we get

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
you have to try to make sure that we get
it<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.520> balanced<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.149> quickly<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.840> possible

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it to be balanced as quickly as possible

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.979 
it to be balanced as quickly as possible
in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> process<00:00:47.270> sometimes<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.840> talk

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
in the process sometimes people talk

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
in the process sometimes people talk
about<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.770> breaking<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.280> every<00:00:50.610> sort<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
about just breaking in every sort of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
about just breaking in every sort of
muscling<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.530> letting<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.100> its

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
muscling it and just letting it do its

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.360 
muscling it and just letting it do its
own<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.899> while<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.980> actually

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
own thing for a while but I actually

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.990 
own thing for a while but I actually
think<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.270> mistake<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.859> once<00:00:59.000> we

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
think that's a mistake because once we

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
think that's a mistake because once we
actually<00:01:00.420> start<00:01:00.629> playing<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> ring<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
actually start playing the ring the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
actually start playing the ring the
clock<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> ticking<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.059> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.449> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
clock is ticking so you want to get as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.530 
clock is ticking so you want to get as
much<00:01:03.930> life<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.040> read<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.549> possible<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
much life out of the read as possible so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810 
much life out of the read as possible so
one<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> things<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.890> immediately<00:01:08.640> do

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
one of the things that I immediately do

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600 
one of the things that I immediately do
when<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.780> brand<00:01:10.200> new<00:01:10.260> read<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
when I get a brand new read is that I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.700 
when I get a brand new read is that I
try<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.020> balance<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> tip<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.479> try<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
try to balance the tip I actually try to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
try to balance the tip I actually try to
use<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.740> by<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.479> front<00:01:18.869> day

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
use it by something there the front day

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
use it by something there the front day
of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.409> read<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> way<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> around<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the read all the way to around the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.690 
of the read all the way to around the
heart<00:01:22.259> area<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.670> sure

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
heart area so that then to make sure

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
heart area so that then to make sure
that<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> whole<00:01:24.360> tip<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> well<00:01:25.409> balanced<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that the whole tip is well balanced and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
that the whole tip is well balanced and
that<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.610> am<00:01:27.180> able<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> determine<00:01:27.900> better

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that way I am able to determine better

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
that way I am able to determine better
how<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> respond<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.869> from

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
how it's going to respond and then from

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
how it's going to respond and then from
there<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:32.100> check<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> sides

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
there I can actually check out the sides

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
there I can actually check out the sides
okay

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
okay

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.149 
okay
then<00:01:35.549> when<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.390> does<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.070> most<00:01:38.070> people

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
then when one does that then most people

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.450 
then when one does that then most people
do<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> day<00:01:39.720> test<00:01:40.049> from<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> side<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
do the day test from side to side of the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.870 
do the day test from side to side of the
read

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
read

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.520 
read
everybody<00:01:42.299> goes<00:01:42.659> something<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.110> there

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.520 

and<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> compare<00:01:46.979> size<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.610> tend<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.530> do

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and to compare size and they tend to do

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310 
and to compare size and they tend to do
a<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.520> adjustment<00:01:50.970> based<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a the adjustment based on that but it is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.100 
a the adjustment based on that but it is
important<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.450> specific<00:01:54.659> because

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
important to be really specific because

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
important to be really specific because
as<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.719> way<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.049> fixes<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> will<00:01:58.979> only

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
as the way that one fixes it will only

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.120 
as the way that one fixes it will only
be<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.549> accurate<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.719> testing<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
be as accurate as the testing so one of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039 
be as accurate as the testing so one of
the<00:02:02.219> things<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.390> based<00:02:03.840> on

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the things that I like to do is based on

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.709 
the things that I like to do is based on
actually<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> ATG<00:02:05.280> system<00:02:05.700> by<00:02:05.850> Tom<00:02:06.360> Brianna

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
actually the ATG system by Tom Brianna

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.469 
actually the ATG system by Tom Brianna
which<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.409> simple<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.030> works

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
which is very simple but it works

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.669 
which is very simple but it works
extremely<00:02:09.690> well

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
extremely well

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.160 
extremely well
and<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:11.549> test<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.629> most<00:02:12.750> important<00:02:13.049> thing

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and the test the most important thing

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.959 
and the test the most important thing
about<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.469> test<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.250> manner<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.640> which<00:02:14.670> we

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
about the test is the manner in which we

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.390 
about the test is the manner in which we
do<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.269> for<00:02:15.480> example<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.140> side<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.650> side<00:02:16.859> of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
do it for example the side to side of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.610 
do it for example the side to side of
the<00:02:17.609> testing<00:02:17.939> degree<00:02:18.209> when<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.750> checking

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the testing degree when we are checking

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.099 
the testing degree when we are checking
one<00:02:20.129> side<00:02:20.549> muffling<00:02:21.359> the<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.689> one<00:02:21.959> by

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
one side muffling the other one by

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.259 
one side muffling the other one by
basically<00:02:22.709> moving<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> reed<00:02:23.579> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:24.150> bit

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
basically moving the reed a little bit

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.750 
basically moving the reed a little bit
or<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.659> side<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.799> we<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.400> check<00:02:26.579> out

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
or the side is that we have to check out

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.300 
or the side is that we have to check out
the<00:02:27.000> initial<00:02:27.510> response<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.139> how<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.099> tapers

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the initial response and how it tapers

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
the initial response and how it tapers
down<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.939> that<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.299> instead<00:02:30.689> of<00:02:30.750> just

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
down so that then instead of just

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.000 
down so that then instead of just
blowing<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> random<00:02:33.599> open<00:02:34.439> G<00:02:36.829> like<00:02:37.829> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
blowing just a random open G like that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.429 
blowing just a random open G like that
it's<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.299> very<00:02:39.510> useful<00:02:40.019> what

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
it's not that it's not very useful what

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.229 
it's not that it's not very useful what
is<00:02:40.560> important<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.069> see<00:02:41.340> how<00:02:41.639> it<00:02:41.879> responds

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
is important is to see how it responds

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.240 
is important is to see how it responds
to<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> initial<00:02:42.959> attack<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.500> how<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.709> decay

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
to the initial attack and how the decay

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.390 
to the initial attack and how the decay
goes<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.299> he<00:02:45.569> recommends<00:02:46.049> I've<00:02:46.470> been<00:02:47.189> using

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
goes so as he recommends I've been using

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.270 
goes so as he recommends I've been using
that<00:02:47.639> method<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.389> work<00:02:48.689> so<00:02:48.989> sexually<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:50.129> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
that method I work so sexually and it is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.009 
that method I work so sexually and it is
that<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.639> to<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> Forte<00:02:51.389> piano<00:02:51.419> and

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
that we have to do a Forte piano and

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.679 
that we have to do a Forte piano and
then<00:02:52.980> diminuendo<00:02:53.489> from<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.909> Forte<00:02:54.180> piano<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.510> it

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
then diminuendo from a Forte piano so it

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.869 
then diminuendo from a Forte piano so it
goes<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.530> nothing<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.069> would<00:02:56.219> be<00:02:56.370> more

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
goes down to nothing so it would be more

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:05.050 
goes down to nothing so it would be more
like<00:02:57.060> this<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.219> other<00:03:02.400> side<00:03:03.500> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
like this and then the other side and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.659 
like this and then the other side and
then<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.269> see<00:03:06.419> how<00:03:06.719> they<00:03:07.409> even<00:03:07.769> show<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.459> K

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
then just see how they even show the K

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.129 
then just see how they even show the K
goes<00:03:08.879> now<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.629> one<00:03:09.780> since<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.019> already

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
goes now in this one since I already

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.349 
goes now in this one since I already
worked<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:11.069> decay<00:03:11.400> goes<00:03:11.639> pretty

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
worked it at the decay goes pretty

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.550 
worked it at the decay goes pretty
similarly<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.319> then<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.459> last<00:03:14.760> test<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.560> as

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
similarly and then the last test as as

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.619 
similarly and then the last test as as
the<00:03:16.829> method<00:03:17.099> recommends<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.639> just<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.329> check

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
the method recommends is just to check

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.390 
the method recommends is just to check
the<00:03:18.989> response<00:03:19.229> through<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> register<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
the response through the register so I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.699 
the response through the register so I
play<00:03:21.019> going<00:03:22.019> through<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.349> harmonic<00:03:22.680> series

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
play going through the harmonic series

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.479 
play going through the harmonic series
the<00:03:23.069> DOE<00:03:23.760> Sol<00:03:24.239> me<00:03:24.629> la<00:03:25.079> fortissimo<00:03:25.949> and<00:03:26.250> then

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
the DOE Sol me la fortissimo and then

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.640 
the DOE Sol me la fortissimo and then
pianissimo<00:03:27.180> immediately<00:03:28.019> after<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.379> check

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
pianissimo immediately after to check

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:37.610 
pianissimo immediately after to check
the<00:03:28.829> response<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.760> responds<00:03:36.620> easily

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
the response and if you responds easily

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.530 
the response and if you responds easily
like<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.189> one<00:03:38.459> day<00:03:38.549> then<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.090> rate<00:03:39.269> is

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
like this one day then the rate is

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.960 
like this one day then the rate is
balanced<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.650> therefore<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.459> would<00:03:41.609> respond

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
balanced and therefore it would respond

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.839 
balanced and therefore it would respond
well<00:03:42.479> so<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.739> course<00:03:43.949> there's<00:03:44.220> all<00:03:44.430> kinds<00:03:44.790> of

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
well so of course there's all kinds of

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.659 
well so of course there's all kinds of
little<00:03:44.909> tricks<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.449> we<00:03:45.629> always<00:03:46.370> adopt<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
little tricks that we always adopt and

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.460 
little tricks that we always adopt and
there's<00:03:48.120> also<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.689> manner<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.019> which<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.290> do

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
there's also the manner in which we do

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.319 
there's also the manner in which we do
it<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.859> depending<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> summer<00:03:50.729> where<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
it and depending on the summer where the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.089 
it and depending on the summer where the
swell<00:03:51.989> up<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.259> little<00:03:52.439> bit<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.919> winter

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
swell up a little bit or the winter

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.740 
swell up a little bit or the winter
where<00:03:53.340> they<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> little<00:03:53.729> bit<00:03:53.909> brittle<00:03:54.269> so

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
where they are a little bit brittle so

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.179 
where they are a little bit brittle so
we<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.139> make<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.500> adjustments<00:03:55.650> to

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
we have to make little adjustments to

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.479 
we have to make little adjustments to
that<00:03:56.340> process<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.930> main<00:03:58.139> idea<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.620> trying

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
that process but the main idea is trying

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.670 
that process but the main idea is trying
to<00:03:59.669> find<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.629> best<00:04:00.840> way<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.019> balance<00:04:01.409> each

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
to find the best way to balance each

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.490 
to find the best way to balance each
side<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.030> tip<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.750> then<00:04:03.930> everything

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
side and the tip so that then everything

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.129 
side and the tip so that then everything
works<00:04:04.829> together<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:06.000> always<00:04:06.299> get<00:04:06.689> into<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
works together we always get into the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.170 
works together we always get into the
place<00:04:08.040> where<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.430> are<00:04:08.549> trying<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:08.909> find

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
place where we are trying to find

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.330 
place where we are trying to find
something<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.900> sounds<00:04:10.530> good<00:04:10.680> or<00:04:10.889> feels<00:04:11.159> good

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
something that sounds good or feels good

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.949 
something that sounds good or feels good
versus<00:04:11.759> something<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.419> actually<00:04:12.540> functions

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
versus something that actually functions

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.960 
versus something that actually functions
properly<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.069> important<00:04:14.400> thing<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.609> that

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
properly and the important thing is that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.339 
properly and the important thing is that
we<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.269> get<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.509> reed<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.750> do<00:04:15.989> what<00:04:16.199> we

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
we have to get the reed to do what we

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.080 
we have to get the reed to do what we
need<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.709> need<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.130> play<00:04:17.310> softly<00:04:17.789> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
need we need it to play softly and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.460 
need we need it to play softly and
loudly

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.650 

and<00:04:28.470> be<00:04:28.950> able<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.280> play<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.700> louder<00:04:30.030> part

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
and be able to play in the louder part

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.390 
and be able to play in the louder part
with<00:04:31.020> keeping<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.470> integrity<00:04:31.890> of<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.160> sound

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
with keeping the integrity of the sound

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.130 
with keeping the integrity of the sound
and<00:04:32.640> for<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.150> responding<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.660> soft<00:04:33.930> a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
and for it to responding in soft a

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:47.620 
and for it to responding in soft a
logical<00:04:34.890> ation<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:46.080> that's<00:04:46.980> why<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.190> little

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
logical ation so that's why this little

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.620 
logical ation so that's why this little
boring<00:04:48.630> exercises<00:04:49.560> or<00:04:50.070> make<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> work<00:04:51.600> very

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
boring exercises or make it work very

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.710 
boring exercises or make it work very
well<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.260> then<00:04:52.440> we<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:52.620> actually<00:04:52.830> use<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.760> reed

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
well and then we can actually use a reed

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:04.679 
well and then we can actually use a reed
that<00:04:54.750> is<00:04:54.990> functional<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:55.560> play<00:04:55.890> music

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.749
