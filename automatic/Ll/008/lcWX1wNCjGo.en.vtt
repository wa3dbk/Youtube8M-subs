00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:16.680
 A storm is coming. 

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:23.729
 It seems you want it to come. 

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.467
 I'm adaptable 

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:33.620
 What are you? 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.718
 I am with whom Gotham will have to settle accounts. 

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.310
 They killed him? 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.501
 I'm not sure. 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.207
 Why do not you just kill me? 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.500
 Your punishment must be more severe. 

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.830
 HOPE HAS BEEN LOST 

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:10.513
 Do you think he will come back? 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.923
 I do not know. 

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.595
 Why did you run away, Bane? 

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:22.964
 You should fear him as much as I do. 

00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:25.433
 FAITH HAS BEEN FRACTURED. 

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:26.893
 I will not bury you. 

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.965
 I've already buried enough members 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 of the Wayne family. 

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:33.772
 A FLAME WILL BURN 

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:38.893
 You do not owe anything to these people anymore. 

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:43.633
 You have given everything. 

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.116
 Not all. 

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:48.448
 Not yet. 

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:51.429
 THIS YEAR 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.763
 THE EPIC CONCLUSION 

00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:58.857
 FROM THE LEGEND OF THE KNIGHT OF THE NIGHT 

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:07.435
 BATMAN THE KNIGHT OF THE NIGHT ASCENDS 

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:10.938
 My mother told me not to get into cars with strangers. 

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:12.788
 This is not a car. 

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:18.374
 SOON
