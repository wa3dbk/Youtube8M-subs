this huge huge cliff I think this is a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.539 
this huge huge cliff I think this is a
something<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> happened<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
something that happened on the

bottom<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> first<00:02:04.049> things

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
bottom of and one of the first things

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.499 
bottom of and one of the first things
I've<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.729> across<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.210> land

I've got to do is get across this land
watch<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.619> zombie

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.880 

so<00:02:12.220> here<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:12.430> go<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.940> they<00:02:13.060> try<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.240> jump<00:02:13.480> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so here we go and they try and jump it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.240 
so here we go and they try and jump it
here<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:14.980> go

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
here we go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:24.210 
here we go
ah<00:02:16.350> 1<00:02:17.350> 2<00:02:17.820> 3<00:02:18.820> yes<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:23.350> thing<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.590> love<00:02:23.740> about<00:02:23.770> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
ah 1 2 3 yes the thing I love about so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.950 
ah 1 2 3 yes the thing I love about so
much<00:02:24.460> about<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> gorillas<00:02:25.180> ORS<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.780> you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
much about the gorillas ORS is that you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.570 
much about the gorillas ORS is that you
can<00:02:26.200> actually<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.710> leave<00:02:26.890> these<00:02:27.100> here<00:02:27.160> and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
can actually just leave these here and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.280 
can actually just leave these here and
you<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.880> come<00:02:28.000> back<00:02:28.180> eventually<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.870> there

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you can come back eventually and there

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.400 
you can come back eventually and there
will<00:02:29.470> grow<00:02:29.710> about<00:02:30.310> 3<00:02:30.730> tool<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.410> they're

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
will grow about 3 tool and they're

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.780 
will grow about 3 tool and they're
pretty<00:02:32.560> decent<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:33.100> honest<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.400> really<00:02:33.430> like

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
pretty decent to be honest I really like

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.640 
pretty decent to be honest I really like
them<00:02:34.030> I've<00:02:34.420> taken<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> diamond<00:02:35.260> ones<00:02:35.440> but

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
them I've taken all the diamond ones but

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.870 
them I've taken all the diamond ones but
if<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.860> want<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.070> grow<00:02:36.190> them<00:02:36.370> all<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.610> do<00:02:36.820> is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
if you want to grow them all you do is

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.220 
if you want to grow them all you do is
just<00:02:37.030> place<00:02:37.210> them<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.660> they<00:02:37.870> will<00:02:38.080> grow

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
just place them and they will grow

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.140 
just place them and they will grow
eventually<00:02:38.470> they<00:02:39.250> don't<00:02:39.430> take<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.730> long<00:02:39.970> at

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
eventually they don't take that long at

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.420 
eventually they don't take that long at
all<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.480> grow<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:42.130> something<00:02:42.280> I've

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
all to grow but this is something I've

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.740 
all to grow but this is something I've
got<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.640> leave<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:43.000> while<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> more<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
got to leave for a while for the more to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.140 
got to leave for a while for the more to
grow<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.830> time<00:02:45.100> for<00:02:45.340> me<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.580> figure<00:02:45.880> out

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
grow but this time for me to figure out

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.710 
grow but this time for me to figure out
what's<00:02:46.450> going<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:48.400> think<00:02:49.150> I'm<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.660> to

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
what's going on and I think I'm going to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.900 
what's going on and I think I'm going to
take<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:50.020> plane<00:02:50.320> if<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.220> actually<00:02:51.490> get

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
take my plane if I can actually get

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.400 
take my plane if I can actually get
there<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:53.020> know<00:02:53.080> how<00:02:53.260> I'm<00:02:53.320> gonna

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
there because I don't know how I'm gonna

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.650 
there because I don't know how I'm gonna
get<00:02:53.590> past<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:53.920> whole<00:02:54.130> cliff<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.300> am<00:02:55.480> gonna

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
get past this whole cliff but I am gonna

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.030 
get past this whole cliff but I am gonna
take<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.930> plane<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.170> go<00:02:56.530> around<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.920> island

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
take my plane and go around the island

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.220 
take my plane and go around the island
and<00:02:57.520> figure<00:02:58.180> out<00:02:58.209> what<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.630> going<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.170> I'm

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
and figure out what is going on so I'm

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.580 
and figure out what is going on so I'm
gonna<00:02:59.380> jump<00:02:59.530> here<00:02:59.709> into<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> water<00:03:01.590> because

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
gonna jump here into the water because

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.410 
gonna jump here into the water because
I've<00:03:02.830> got<00:03:02.950> my<00:03:03.070> basic<00:03:03.520> requirements<00:03:04.090> now<00:03:04.180> of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I've got my basic requirements now of

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.940 
I've got my basic requirements now of
just<00:03:04.750> some<00:03:04.870> ores<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.530> kind<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.740> stuff

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
just some ores and that kind of stuff

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.900 
just some ores and that kind of stuff
and<00:03:06.550> what<00:03:06.940> I'm<00:03:07.030> looking<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:08.910> to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and what I'm looking for is just to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.880 
and what I'm looking for is just to
figure<00:03:10.480> out<00:03:10.570> why<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.110> many<00:03:11.260> people<00:03:11.410> are<00:03:11.650> cured

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
figure out why so many people are cured

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.150 
figure out why so many people are cured
by<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.220> tsunami<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.739> has<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.130> be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
by that tsunami and this just has to be

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.020 
by that tsunami and this just has to be
stopped<00:03:15.550> because<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.420> my<00:03:16.630> last<00:03:16.840> little<00:03:17.230> vlog<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
stopped because of my last little vlog I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.000 
stopped because of my last little vlog I
I<00:03:19.030> did<00:03:19.600> find<00:03:19.930> out<00:03:20.050> some<00:03:20.290> weird<00:03:20.440> stuff<00:03:20.800> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
I did find out some weird stuff and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.040 
I did find out some weird stuff and
there's<00:03:21.640> something<00:03:21.850> definitely<00:03:22.420> dodgy<00:03:22.900> going

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
there's something definitely dodgy going

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.170 
there's something definitely dodgy going
on<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> that's<00:03:24.400> why<00:03:24.580> I've<00:03:24.670> got<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.820> figure<00:03:25.090> out

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
on and that's why I've got to figure out

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.900 
on and that's why I've got to figure out
what<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.570> hell<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.840> going<00:03:26.110> on<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.670> I've<00:03:27.790> been

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
what the hell is going on so I've been

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.030 
what the hell is going on so I've been
traveling<00:03:28.150> now<00:03:28.480> for<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.410> little<00:03:29.680> bit<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
traveling now for just a little bit and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.770 
traveling now for just a little bit and
I've<00:03:30.550> decided<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.000> I'm<00:03:31.180> gonna<00:03:31.330> stop<00:03:31.630> off

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
I've decided that I'm gonna stop off
