tillage<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> increase<00:00:19.920> soil<00:00:20.160> fertility<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
tillage so increase soil fertility and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.370

that worms till it up they come up in
the<00:00:25.470> winter<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:26.039> eat<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> cardboard<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the winter they eat the cardboard and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.259 
the winter they eat the cardboard and
the<00:00:27.420> hay<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:29.099> spring<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:30.029> kind

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the hay and then in spring you just kind

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.160 
the hay and then in spring you just kind
of<00:00:30.300> pull<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.539> apart

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of pull it apart

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.850 
of pull it apart
plant<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.949> seedlings<00:00:32.239> it's<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.559> less<00:00:34.559> labor

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
plant your seedlings it's a less labor

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.580 
plant your seedlings it's a less labor
overall<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.820> better<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> soil<00:00:39.590> I'm

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
overall and it's better for the soil I'm

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.190 
overall and it's better for the soil I'm
in<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> sustainable<00:00:41.340> program<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.660 

firing<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.289> necessary<00:00:46.860> people<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> eat

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
firing is necessary people need to eat

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840 
firing is necessary people need to eat
food<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.020> believe<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.460> should<00:00:50.489> do

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
food and so I believe that we should do

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.040 
food and so I believe that we should do
it<00:00:51.030> appropriately<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> work<00:00:54.050> for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it appropriately and have it work for

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.310 
it appropriately and have it work for
all<00:00:55.110> people<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.129> serve<00:00:56.430> some<00:00:56.820> needs

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
all people not just serve some needs

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
all people not just serve some needs
because<00:00:58.320> ultimately<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.070> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
