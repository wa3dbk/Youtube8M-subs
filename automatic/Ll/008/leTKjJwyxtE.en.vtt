00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it everywhere I think it stays on a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.870 
it everywhere I think it stays on a
really<00:00:54.989> long<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:56.790> a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
really long time it's a really even a

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.240 
really long time it's a really even a
national<00:00:57.090> tanner<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.590> doesn't<00:00:58.920> take<00:00:59.070> time

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
national tanner and it doesn't take time

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
national tanner and it doesn't take time
to<00:00:59.399> build<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> Jergens<00:01:00.300> ones<00:01:00.510> do

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
to build up like the Jergens ones do

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
to build up like the Jergens ones do
those<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.320> feel<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.040> on<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
those I feel you have to put on like

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
those I feel you have to put on like
five<00:01:02.460> times<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.059> anything<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.110> sudden

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
five times see anything this is sudden

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
five times see anything this is sudden
color<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.219> as<00:01:05.460> soon<00:01:05.579> as<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.759> put<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
color so as soon as you put it on you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.699 
color so as soon as you put it on you
can<00:01:06.450> tell<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.959> and<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.439> takes<00:01:07.530> about

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:07.709 
can tell it's there and it takes about

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.949 
can tell it's there and it takes about
four<00:01:08.009> hours<00:01:08.039> see<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.609> the<00:01:08.700> full<00:01:08.939> color<00:01:09.209> and<00:01:09.899> I

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
four hours see at the full color and I

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.359 
four hours see at the full color and I
would<00:01:10.079> say<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> lasts<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.799> week<00:01:11.039> without

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
would say it lasts about a week without

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.099 
would say it lasts about a week without
touching<00:01:11.819> up<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.209> like<00:01:12.389> to<00:01:12.420> keep<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:12.959> it

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
touching up I like to keep it up with it

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.660 
touching up I like to keep it up with it
so<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.289> probably<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.740> twice<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> week<00:01:14.219> it<00:01:14.429> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so I probably do it twice a week it is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
so I probably do it twice a week it is
best<00:01:14.909> before<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.359> put<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.569> on<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> exfoliate

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
best before you put it on to exfoliate

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
best before you put it on to exfoliate
the<00:01:16.289> skin<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.859> then<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.609> say<00:01:17.759> today

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the skin and then I would say today

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
the skin and then I would say today
after<00:01:18.329> you<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.539> it<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.749> make<00:01:19.079> sure<00:01:19.109> you<00:01:19.289> keep

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
after you put it on make sure you keep

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
after you put it on make sure you keep
moisture<00:01:19.679> izing<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.639> you<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.759> get

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
moisture izing just so you don't get

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179 
moisture izing just so you don't get
dead<00:01:21.119> skin<00:01:21.149> because<00:01:21.659> dead<00:01:21.899> skin<00:01:22.170> makes<00:01:22.619> your

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
dead skin because dead skin makes your

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
dead skin because dead skin makes your
skin<00:01:23.340> flake<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.029> if<00:01:24.209> your<00:01:24.329> skin<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.600> flaking

looking<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.210> concealer<00:04:43.690> for<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.530> redness

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
looking for a concealer for the redness

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.230 
looking for a concealer for the redness
or<00:04:45.130> under-eye<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.729> would<00:04:45.880> highly<00:04:46.210> recommend

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
or under-eye I would highly recommend

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.610 
or under-eye I would highly recommend
giving<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.020> try

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
giving this a try

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.760 
giving this a try
it<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.520> mineral<00:04:48.820> base<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.630> would<00:04:49.960> say<00:04:50.200> use

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
it is a mineral base so I would say use

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.430 
it is a mineral base so I would say use
it<00:04:50.800> with<00:04:51.160> mineral<00:04:51.520> makeup<00:04:51.900> I've<00:04:52.900> never<00:04:53.169> used

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
it with mineral makeup I've never used

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.200 
it with mineral makeup I've never used
it<00:04:53.620> with<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.860> liquid<00:04:54.250> foundation<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:54.910> don't

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
it with a liquid foundation so I don't

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.510 
it with a liquid foundation so I don't
know<00:04:55.419> how<00:04:56.290> well<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.860> will<00:04:56.979> pair

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
know how well that you will pair

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.980 
know how well that you will pair
together<00:04:57.669> but<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.300> really<00:04:58.540> like<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> well

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
together but I really like the well

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.560 
together but I really like the well
rested<00:04:59.290> concealer<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.910> last<00:05:01.120> thing<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.540> a

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
rested concealer and the last thing is a

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.740 
rested concealer and the last thing is a
Maybelline<00:05:02.100> palette<00:05:03.100> called<00:05:03.610> natural<00:05:04.390> smokes

everything even if I just use one of the
colors<00:05:14.100> I'll<00:05:15.100> pair<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.490> with<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.640> bunch<00:05:15.820> of

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.109 
must be eyeliner but you can wear them
however<00:05:38.909> you<00:05:39.209> want<00:05:39.889> again<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:41.489> color<00:05:41.909> payoff

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:42.119 
however you want again the color payoff

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:44.179 
however you want again the color payoff

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189

it's<00:05:46.979> a<00:05:47.039> great<00:05:47.219> palette<00:05:47.899> not<00:05:48.899> only<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.289> wear

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
it's a great palette not only to wear

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.229 
it's a great palette not only to wear
altogether<00:05:49.949> by<00:05:50.279> itself<00:05:50.519> but<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:50.999> pair<00:05:51.179> with

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:51.239 
altogether by itself but to pair with
