 today we are going to make some delicious balls 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.899
 of candy popcorn that surely 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.150
 that you have tried them all but in the 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.459
 balls is going to be a delicious snack and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.869
 sure they will fly off the table besides 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.390
 They are ideal for a party 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.740
 birthday or even to give as 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.810
 following that we are going to use are going to 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.600
 be a half bag of popcorn for 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.330
 microwave about 40 milliliters of cream 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.760
 to mount 70 grams of white sugar 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.160
 a trickle of water 10 grams of 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.190
 unsalted butter and about 2 tablespoons 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.710
 of agave syrup or syrup though 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 this is optional 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.590
 first what we are going to do is put 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.030
 our bag of popcorn in the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.410
 microwave following the instructions 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.720
 to put the bag 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.780
 and once we have them we will pass them 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.850
 to a bowl to cool it I remember you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.770
 that the amounts come for a half 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.809
 of the stock market if you have company at home 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.210
 do it twice as surely because they are going to 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 fly and while there are many guys 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 of them are going to fall 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 once we let them cool down we put in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 a saucepan in a pan our caramel 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.680
 let's do so we put first the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.610
 sugar we can put a splash of water 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.670
 and leave it without moving a medium fire for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 another side we will put our cream with 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.820
 our butter and our syrup 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 agave to heat the microwave when 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.550
 our block candy is ready 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.800
 that starts to get golden 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.140
 we will pour our cream mixture and 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 butter and it must be hot 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 so that when the truth does not 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.720
 splash 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.750
 but I'm saying it 's on fire 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.090
 It is off and has no heat once 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.770
 we mix it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.170
 we will pour this on the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.179
 the lomitas and we will remove them so that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.609
 all integrate well and only 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.530
 we have to get our hands wet with oil and 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.539
 give it the shapes that we want can be 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.710
 bigger are smaller me with the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.640
 size that have come out since 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.530
 about 8 balls 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.540
 I remember that it has been with half a bag 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.220
 and then also if you want instead of that 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.570
 be like popcorn rocks you can 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.549
 put the sticks that we use to 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.530
 make the cake pops bohai simply a 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.660
 extreme in the candy and also what 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.040
 you can present to give a gift 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040
 sachet that are ideal 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.269
 and once we're doing it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.310
 we leave on the oven tray or 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.600
 on a tray where we will have 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 put baking paper 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.160
 and we'll let them cool down and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 fit well and uniform and rigid 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.980
 I also remind you that you should have retired 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.480
 the grains that have not exploded to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.829
 then when you eat it, not the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.379
 I found is what can be a little bit 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.879
 unpleasant and you see that it is very 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.640
 simple also if you want you can then 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.079
 melt about 50 grams of chocolate and with 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.670
 a fine mouthpiece make it a small 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.560
 drawing or if you do not have a mouthpiece 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.019
 simply with a fork you go through 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.909
 above you see that it is very simple that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.739
 the kids will love it and it can be 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.019
 ideal for a birthday party or 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.120
 to put a snack tray 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.739
 sweet so I hope you become very
