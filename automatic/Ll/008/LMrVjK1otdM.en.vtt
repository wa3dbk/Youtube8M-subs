00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
the two balls that you will see in this

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.700 
the two balls that you will see in this
video<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:39.430> first<00:00:39.460> ball<00:00:39.940> number<00:00:40.270> 48<00:00:40.720> has<00:00:41.140> been

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.310 
video the first ball number 48 has been
drilled<00:00:41.980> so<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.430> pin<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:43.149> above<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.930> fingers

drilled so the pin is above the fingers
and<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:45.160> just<00:00:45.429> so<00:00:45.550> happens<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.090> we<00:00:46.269> need<00:00:46.420> a

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
and it just so happens that we need a

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.930 
and it just so happens that we need a
balanced<00:00:46.960> hole<00:00:47.170> right<00:00:47.559> next<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:48.039> the<00:00:48.129> pin<00:00:48.399> to
