between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock on the drum right

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.210 
between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock on the drum right
here<00:03:19.700> between<00:03:20.150> 6<00:03:20.480> &amp;<00:03:20.660> 9<00:03:20.690> o'clock<00:03:21.140> now<00:03:22.070> what

here between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock now what

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.290 
here between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock now what
we're<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.490> use<00:03:22.610> we're<00:03:22.820> going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.000> tape

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
we're going to use we're going to tape

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.750 
we're going to use we're going to tape
take<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.960> pencil<00:03:24.380> tip<00:03:24.560> we're<00:03:25.340> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.550> put

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
take that pencil tip we're going to put

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400 
take that pencil tip we're going to put
it<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:25.970> towards<00:03:26.240> yourself<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.080> we're<00:03:27.260> going

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
it in towards yourself and we're going

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.980 
it in towards yourself and we're going
to<00:03:27.560> drop<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.250> pencil<00:03:28.520> tip<00:03:28.880> across<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.750> drum

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
to drop the pencil tip across the drum

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.250 
to drop the pencil tip across the drum
like<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.400> between<00:03:31.400> 6<00:03:31.670> &amp;<00:03:31.820> 9<00:03:31.850> o'clock<00:03:32.240> and<00:03:32.930> just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
like this between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock and just

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.180 
like this between 6 &amp; 9 o'clock and just
go<00:03:33.380> down<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.890> then<00:03:34.880> come<00:03:34.910> up<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.680> same<00:03:36.980> way

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
go down and then come up the same way

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.040 
go down and then come up the same way
that<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.490> went<00:03:37.670> down<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.630> let's<00:03:38.750> do<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> couple

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
that you went down so let's do a couple

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.340 
that you went down so let's do a couple
of<00:03:39.200> basic<00:03:39.590> strokes<00:03:39.920> together

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.870 

so<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.830> basic<00:03:49.160> background<00:03:49.280> stroke

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
so this is the basic background stroke

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.770 
so this is the basic background stroke
it's<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:51.050> down<00:03:51.290> up<00:03:51.620> motion<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:53.330> best<00:03:53.540> bar

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
it's just a down up motion the best bar

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.000 
it's just a down up motion the best bar
on<00:03:53.930> players<00:03:54.200> in<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.470> world<00:03:54.650> will

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
on players in the world will

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.400 
on players in the world will
continuously<00:03:55.520> do<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.120> with<00:03:56.360> one<00:03:56.750> beater<00:03:57.110> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
continuously do this with one beater and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.470 
continuously do this with one beater and
as<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.100> work<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.370> faster<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:58.880> faster<00:03:59.060> there's

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
as they work a faster and faster there's

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.120 
as they work a faster and faster there's
so<00:03:59.630> much<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.990> can<00:04:00.110> be<00:04:00.230> done<00:04:00.410> with<00:04:00.620> one<00:04:00.890> side

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
so much that can be done with one side

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.790 
so much that can be done with one side
of<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.340> beater<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:02.450> fun<00:04:02.900> part<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.380> eventually

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
of the beater the fun part is eventually

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.680 
of the beater the fun part is eventually
getting<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.670> top<00:04:04.910> end<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.330> beater<00:04:05.510> to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
getting the top end of the beater to

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.720 
getting the top end of the beater to
come<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.800> what<00:04:06.950> we're<00:04:07.070> going<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.220> do<00:04:07.400> now<00:04:07.550> is

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
come in so what we're going to do now is

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.430 
come in so what we're going to do now is
we're<00:04:07.880> going<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.120> talk<00:04:08.390> about<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.960> rhythm<00:04:09.290> and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
we're going to talk about a rhythm and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.440 
we're going to talk about a rhythm and
that<00:04:09.740> is<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.160> next<00:04:10.370> lesson<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.240> if<00:04:11.300> you're
