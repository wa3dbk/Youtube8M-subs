and heal it around the plant
keine<00:01:49.229> doesn't<00:01:49.680> seem<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.009> sometimes<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> had

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
keine doesn't seem right sometimes I had

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.639 
keine doesn't seem right sometimes I had
a<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.420> hard<00:01:51.659> time<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.200> hilling

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
a really hard time with a hilling

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.639 
a really hard time with a hilling
because<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.869> covering<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> green<00:01:55.380> which

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
because of covering up the green which

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.820 
because of covering up the green which
is<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.189> photosynthesis<00:01:56.970> for<00:01:57.830> getting

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
is what the photosynthesis for getting

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.010 
is what the photosynthesis for getting
food<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.340> plants<00:01:59.729> but<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.119> potatoes<00:02:00.659> if

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
food for the plants but with potatoes if

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.649 
food for the plants but with potatoes if
you<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.289> not<00:02:01.439> heal<00:02:01.770> them<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.250> will<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.970> lot

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you do not heal them you will get a lot

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
you do not heal them you will get a lot
less<00:02:03.689> potatoes<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> first<00:02:05.640> time<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
less potatoes I know the first time I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.900 
after but I loosen the dirt around and
you<00:02:32.430> got<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.670> heal<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:34.370> cover<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.459> some<00:02:35.819> of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you got to heal it up cover up some of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.259 
you got to heal it up cover up some of
these<00:02:36.030> basically<00:02:36.870> there's<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.620> tiny

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
these basically there's little tiny

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.130 
these basically there's little tiny
spines<00:02:39.269> on<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> edge<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.239> stem<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.540> those

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
spines on the edge of the stem and those

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
spines on the edge of the stem and those
will<00:02:43.410> actually<00:02:43.620> root<00:02:44.100> out<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.610> make<00:02:44.850> more

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
will actually root out and make more

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.380 
will actually root out and make more
tubers<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.709> more<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.010> heal<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:48.209> more

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
tubers so the more you heal the more

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.949 
tubers so the more you heal the more
potatoes<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.930> get<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.410> after<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.280> heal<00:02:50.519> it

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
potatoes you get and after you heal it

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.560 
potatoes you get and after you heal it
like<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> say<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:53.070> found<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> lot<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.359> some

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
like I say I just found it a lot of some

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.199 
like I say I just found it a lot of some
people<00:02:54.959> will<00:02:55.470> take<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> tire<00:02:56.100> an<00:02:56.430> old<00:02:56.609> tire<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
people will take a tire an old tire and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.520 
people will take a tire an old tire and
they<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.510> keep<00:02:57.690> filling<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.320> dirt

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
they just keep filling it with dirt

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.650 
they just keep filling it with dirt
basically<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.489> do<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.820> make<00:03:00.359> sure<00:03:00.390> you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
basically if you do that make sure you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.140 
basically if you do that make sure you
leave<00:03:00.840> some<00:03:01.290> green<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.769> top<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:02.640> grow<00:03:02.850> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
leave some green at the top to grow and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.789 
leave some green at the top to grow and
then<00:03:03.239> after<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.660> grows<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.350> continue

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
then after that grows you can continue

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.110 
then after that grows you can continue
to<00:03:04.920> heal<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.430> kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.820> an<00:03:05.940> interesting

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
to heal it it's kind of an interesting

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.960 
to heal it it's kind of an interesting
process<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.680> more<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.010> Hill<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.790> more

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
process but the more you Hill the more

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.390 
process but the more you Hill the more
potatoes<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.510> will<00:03:09.660> get<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.620> another<00:03:11.070> key

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
potatoes you will get but another key

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.030 
potatoes you will get but another key
also<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.359> that<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.660> need<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.049> water<00:03:13.260> from

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
here so you want a nice thick layer of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.940 
here so you want a nice thick layer of
straw<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.750> want<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.989> bring<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.350> up<00:03:55.709> and

over and what that does is it keeps the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.949 
over and what that does is it keeps the
potatoes<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.940> tubers<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.449> will<00:04:00.600> kind<00:04:00.840> of

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
potatoes the tubers that will kind of

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.090 
potatoes the tubers that will kind of
