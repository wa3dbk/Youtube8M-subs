00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.530
 once there are those who want 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.510
 this measure 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.529
 everything works 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.529
 everyone is reading 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.970
 I can imagine 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.849
 but more than the economy has returned to win 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 there are dreams that are born with us 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.349
 and grow with us 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.769
 dreams that accompany us through life both strength and courage to face 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.489
 the challenges that the saved destination 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.510
 this is the history of solidarity or 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.430
 he was raised in a true paradise 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 and since I usually say 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 always dreamed of leaving behind his life and his city 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.270
 to make your life and life 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.450
 a distant Kirilenko country of opportunities 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.549
 the same goal in very distant dreams 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.449
 but united by peace and a slice a shipment in living a much better life than 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.970
 in the United States do not quote peace 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.360
 the others 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 and the life that we plan 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.890
 all united has a price to conquer it it is necessary to go back is 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.040
 hard to win 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 tonight through a group by the river and you go with them 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.140
 flowers 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 the square of wood 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.140
 it's a love story, passion and hope 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330
 a great success in brazil 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.520
 since people always dreamed
