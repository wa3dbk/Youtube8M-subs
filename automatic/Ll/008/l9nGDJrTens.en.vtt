hi<00:00:06.240> welcome<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> fin<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.049> feather<00:00:07.109> report

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
hi welcome to the fin and feather report

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.930 
hi welcome to the fin and feather report
today<00:00:07.830> as<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.280> we're<00:00:08.580> talking<00:00:08.849> about

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
today as you can see we're talking about

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.120 
today as you can see we're talking about
sleeping<00:00:09.389> bags<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.050> how<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.860> choose<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
sleeping bags and how to choose the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.910 
sleeping bags and how to choose the
right<00:00:11.250> sleeping<00:00:11.759> bag<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:13.500> two<00:00:13.740> main

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
right sleeping bag for you the two main

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.230 
right sleeping bag for you the two main
differences<00:00:14.160> between<00:00:14.429> them<00:00:14.910> will<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
differences between them will be the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390 
differences between them will be the
type<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> insulation<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.740> there's

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
type of insulation that you have there's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
type of insulation that you have there's
synthetic<00:00:17.789> insulation<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.480> down<00:00:18.600> insulation

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
synthetic insulation and down insulation

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.660 
synthetic insulation and down insulation
and<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.770> which<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and you want to know which is going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.010 
and you want to know which is going to
be<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> right<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.420> where<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.720> going

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
be the right one for where you're going

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.359 
be the right one for where you're going
the<00:00:22.350> first<00:00:22.590> thing<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.949> should<00:00:22.980> think<00:00:23.250> about

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the first thing you should think about

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
the first thing you should think about
is<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.850> type<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.510> temperature<00:00:24.869> range<00:00:25.050> going

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
is what type of temperature range going

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.540 
is what type of temperature range going
to<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.949> if<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.430> other

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
to be in like if you already have other

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.890 
to be in like if you already have other
sleeping<00:00:26.880> bags<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.720> need

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
sleeping bags where you just need

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
sleeping bags where you just need
something<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.410> fill<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.830> temperature<00:00:29.310> ranges

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
something to fill in temperature ranges

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.550 
something to fill in temperature ranges
that<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.150> cover<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:31.109> you're<00:00:31.470> looking

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that you don't cover or you're looking

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860 
that you don't cover or you're looking
for<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:31.980> bag<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.030> so

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
for one bag that's going to do it all so

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
for one bag that's going to do it all so
for<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.590> instance<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> look<00:00:35.430> at

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
for this instance we're going to look at

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
for this instance we're going to look at
30<00:00:35.790> degree<00:00:36.090> bags<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> your<00:00:37.469> two

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
30 degree bags that's kind of your two

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
30 degree bags that's kind of your two
and<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> half<00:00:38.309> season<00:00:38.969> bags<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.570> something<00:00:39.870> will

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and a half season bags so something will

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
and a half season bags so something will
be<00:00:40.170> mostly<00:00:40.739> comfortable<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> summer<00:00:41.460> but

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
be mostly comfortable in the summer but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.069 
be mostly comfortable in the summer but
if<00:00:42.059> you're<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.570> longer

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
if you're going to be going longer

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
if you're going to be going longer
either<00:00:43.430> early<00:00:44.430> spring<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.450> bit

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
either early spring or like a little bit

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000 
either early spring or like a little bit
into<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> fall<00:00:46.079> we'll<00:00:46.289> still<00:00:46.500> cover<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
into the fall we'll still cover you for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
into the fall we'll still cover you for
a<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.219> temperature<00:00:47.460> range<00:00:47.820> there's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
a good temperature range there's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
a good temperature range there's
synthetic<00:00:48.960> insulation<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:49.950> down

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
synthetic insulation and there's down

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790 
synthetic insulation and there's down
insulation<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.120> most<00:00:51.390> cases<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.140> down-filled

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
insulation in most cases a down-filled

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
insulation in most cases a down-filled
bag<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.000> superior<00:00:54.449> insulation<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
bag will have a superior insulation and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
bag will have a superior insulation and
that<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.190> lighter<00:00:56.430> weight<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that it's going to be lighter weight to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
that it's going to be lighter weight to
be<00:00:57.449> more<00:00:57.690> compressible<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
be more compressible and it's going to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.459 
be more compressible and it's going to
last<00:00:59.039> longer<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.510> works<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> bag

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
last longer so the down works in the bag

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
last longer so the down works in the bag
the<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.100> works<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> goose<00:01:02.609> when

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the same way it works on the goose when

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
the same way it works on the goose when
it<00:01:03.480> gets<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:03.840> cold<00:01:04.080> outside<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.769> feathers

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it gets really cold outside the feathers

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
it gets really cold outside the feathers
all<00:01:05.430> expand<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> create<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.600> loft<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all expand out and create more loft and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.000 
all expand out and create more loft and
it's<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> keep<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.799> comfortable

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it's going to keep you more comfortable

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's going to keep you more comfortable
but<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.060> gets<00:01:09.180> warmer<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.659> those<00:01:10.140> feathers

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
but as it gets warmer out those feathers

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
but as it gets warmer out those feathers
start<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.240> don't<00:01:12.240> provide<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.600> much

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
start to come down don't provide as much

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
start to come down don't provide as much
insulation<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.159> keeps<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> more

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
insulation and it keeps you more

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
insulation and it keeps you more
comfortable<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.420> warmer<00:01:15.979> synthetic

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
comfortable just warmer synthetic

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
comfortable just warmer synthetic
fabrics<00:01:17.340> can't<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.119> ok<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.689> we're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fabrics can't do that ok so we're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.390 
fabrics can't do that ok so we're
picking<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> bag<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> we're<00:01:20.340> gonna

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
picking out a bag here and we're gonna

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
picking out a bag here and we're gonna
go<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.850> Marmot<00:01:21.330> neverwinter<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.049> a
