down the stretch in this game

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.460 
down the stretch in this game
and<00:02:09.729> even<00:02:10.420> yesterday<00:02:10.599> we<00:02:10.899> scored<00:02:11.170> some<00:02:11.290> big

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
fourth-quarter ticks on fries which is

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.490 
fourth-quarter ticks on fries which is
nice<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.480> see<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> pressure<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
nice to see when the pressure is the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.020 
nice to see when the pressure is the
highest<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.580> weren't<00:02:15.700> here<00:02:15.760> six

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030

highest that's when you weren't here six
on<00:02:16.180> five<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.690> at<00:02:16.959> its<00:02:17.140> best<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.190> know

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
on five to be at its best so you know

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.729 
on five to be at its best so you know
that's<00:02:18.400> certainly<00:02:18.730> an<00:02:18.849> area<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:20.440> want<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
that's certainly an area that we want to

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's certainly an area that we want to
be<00:02:21.010> at<00:02:22.000> top<00:02:22.270> shape<00:02:22.510> when<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:22.989> get<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> world

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
be at top shape when we get the world

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.870 
be at top shape when we get the world
championships<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.069> we'll<00:02:24.459> spend<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.849> of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
championships and we'll spend a lot of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.309 
championships and we'll spend a lot of
time<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.930> better<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.260> better

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
time on that it got better and better

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.780 
time on that it got better and better
throughout<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> week<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.459> nice<00:02:27.640> to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
throughout the week and that was nice to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970
