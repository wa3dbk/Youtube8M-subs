 samuel towers that occupy the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.650
 space where there were before 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.110
 buildings inserted in the Moorish fence 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.630
 that there were preserved the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 and other old elements that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 tell the story of the place 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.920
 in all outer spaces we want 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.400
 to recover the affection the idea of ​​the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.950
 idea of ​​the açaí of the round that would exist 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.050
 we are on one of the feet of the wall 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.000
 is about sewage and therefore it is 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.610
 was not visible slow because they saw the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.730
 usaid hid the situation so much zeal 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.160
 manifest and a whole logic of the castle 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.580
 is precisely in this situation of the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.920
 different planes in which stage in the zone 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.900
 malaria and then softwares that had 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.720
 because there are others that the line that only for the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.080
 the tip after the cult 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.500
 to the other that you eva the possible trait goes 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.680
 to take everything on course what is it 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.630
 this constant also the logic of 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.330
 different levels that happens when speaking 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.310
 therefore this special situation of the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.950
 The own alfama fabric also happens 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.110
 here in outer space the colonel wore 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.400
 10 have ways to live a moment 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.600
 look like a bread factory exams 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.930
 antidoping forums is to create a space 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.190
 very special and that is what leads to 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 article 3 of the value of sports alcohol 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:25.250
 and then there's the lessons from this living room 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:29.910
 It has the same contemporary dining room 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.120
 mexico where it's like a house 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.130
 dunga parts do not match in all 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.280
 there is neither the same date nor the same 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.940
 language and therefore in a logic not 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.079
 is doing everything to give her everything 's not the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.590
 to match 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.480
 both this is the promotion of events of 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.370
 france though all drawn effects 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.430
 today and was developed to what is known 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.950
 to be seen but the hotel has 42 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.349
 bedrooms 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.610
 the stink guests can access the 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.890
 sleeping steps 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.080
 through a staircase that 12 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.420
 buildings and that once again that through 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.319
 of a book released shows the hardness of 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.660
 alfama 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.580
 the rooms are contemporary with 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.800
 materials and colors that refer to one 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.590
 comfortable and chemical environment 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.720
 the same is the reputation of brands for the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.989
 which is most characteristic 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.989
