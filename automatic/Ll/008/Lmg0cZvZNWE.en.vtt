real at support and I think it might be
the<00:00:40.140> first<00:00:40.469> gameplay<00:00:41.070> footage<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.239> very

based<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.770> way<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:57.980> works<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.550> that<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
based on the way it works is that the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.110 
based on the way it works is that the
villain<00:01:59.830> looks<00:02:00.830> down<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.400> whole<00:02:01.550> level<00:02:01.760> and

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
villain looks down the whole level and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.690 
villain looks down the whole level and
he<00:02:02.300> can<00:02:02.480> set<00:02:02.810> monsters<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.590> attack<00:02:03.620> he<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.460> set

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
he can set monsters to attack he can set

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.050 
he can set monsters to attack he can set
traps<00:02:05.210> he<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:05.840> set<00:02:06.470> up<00:02:06.620> ambushes<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.880> can

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
traps he can set up ambushes you can

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.330 
traps he can set up ambushes you can
tell<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.420> monsters<00:02:08.899> which<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.130> four

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
tell the monsters which of the four

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.120 
tell the monsters which of the four
heroes<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.850> attack<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.200> becomes<00:02:12.500> more<00:02:12.800> sort

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
heroes to attack so it becomes more sort

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.830 
heroes to attack so it becomes more sort
of<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.550> guess<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:14.000> kind<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.180> more<00:02:14.300> tabletop

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
of I guess that's kind of more tabletop

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.520 
of I guess that's kind of more tabletop
RPGs<00:02:15.350> there's<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.920> sense<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
RPGs there's a sense of of that to it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860 
RPGs there's a sense of of that to it
and<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.730> mean<00:02:19.850> what<00:02:20.060> was<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.630> impression

being one type of game and then sign
comes<00:02:33.260> out<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.620> they've<00:02:33.770> changed<00:02:34.070> quite<00:02:34.400> a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
comes out and they've changed quite a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.910 
comes out and they've changed quite a
lot<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.000> because<00:02:35.570> obviously<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:36.380> think<00:02:36.830> your

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
lot of it because obviously I think your

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.210 
lot of it because obviously I think your
gut<00:02:37.130> feeling<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.730> bit<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.360> bit<00:02:39.190> yeah

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
gut feeling it's a bit be a bit yeah

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.010 
gut feeling it's a bit be a bit yeah
what's<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.820> but<00:02:40.940> certain<00:02:41.330> bits<00:02:41.510> kind<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
what's going it but certain bits kind of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.280 
what's going it but certain bits kind of
seem<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.350> they<00:02:42.500> they<00:02:42.920> worked<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.850> heroes

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
seem like they they worked the heroes

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.510 
seem like they they worked the heroes
combined<00:02:45.290> or<00:02:45.950> something<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.280> not<00:02:46.400> like

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
combined or something it's not like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.760 
combined or something it's not like
physically<00:02:47.030> combined<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.080> mage<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.620> this

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
physically combined but the mage in this

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.840 
physically combined but the mage in this
demo<00:02:49.010> at<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.910> sort<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.650> frosty<00:02:51.650> spell<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
demo at this sort of frosty spell the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.390 
demo at this sort of frosty spell the
froze<00:02:53.209> enemies<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.140> then<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.040> other<00:02:55.190> player

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
froze enemies and then the other player

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.240 
froze enemies and then the other player
one<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> Archer<00:02:56.690> could<00:02:57.050> pursue<00:02:57.920> enemy<00:02:58.190> so

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
one of the Archer could pursue enemy so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.250 
one of the Archer could pursue enemy so
I<00:02:58.430> mean<00:02:58.610> that's<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.940> bit<00:02:59.090> basic<00:02:59.239> but<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.870> could

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
I mean that's a bit basic but you could

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.860 
I mean that's a bit basic but you could
kinda<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.950> stuff<00:03:01.190> working<00:03:01.660> possibly<00:03:02.660> I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
kinda see that stuff working possibly I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.810 
kinda see that stuff working possibly I
mean<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.440> really<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:03.890> think<00:03:03.950> much<00:03:04.520> way<00:03:04.760> to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
mean it really is I think much way to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.449 
mean it really is I think much way to
tell<00:03:05.720> an<00:03:06.230> even<00:03:06.380> lion<00:03:06.709> had<00:03:06.920> said<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.220> game<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
tell an even lion had said this game is

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.190 
tell an even lion had said this game is
all<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> long<00:03:08.000> way<00:03:08.209> off<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.570> this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.810> nothing

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
all a long way off and this is nothing

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080 
all a long way off and this is nothing
so<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:09.440> not<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> launch<00:03:09.860> title<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.790> know<00:03:10.970> in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so it's not a launch title I know in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.699 
so it's not a launch title I know in
this<00:03:11.209> launch<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.690> game<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> long

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
this launch this game is a long

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.259 
this launch this game is a long
