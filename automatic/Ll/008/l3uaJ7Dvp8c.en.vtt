00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
going to be because Peter Capaldi seems

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.510 
going to be because Peter Capaldi seems
like<00:06:03.000> he's<00:06:03.120> kind<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.420> like<00:06:03.480> edgy<00:06:04.380> and<00:06:04.650> funny

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
like he's kind of like edgy and funny

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.700 
like he's kind of like edgy and funny
and<00:06:05.880> he's<00:06:06.060> also<00:06:06.300> older<00:06:06.690> so<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.020> really<00:06:07.410> like<00:06:07.560> to

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
and he's also older so I really like to

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.910 
and he's also older so I really like to
see<00:06:07.890> how<00:06:08.390> that<00:06:09.390> goes<00:06:09.450> I'm<00:06:10.290> kind<00:06:10.710> of

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
see how that goes I'm kind of

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.590 
see how that goes I'm kind of
anticipating<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.820> day<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.120> Steven<00:06:12.450> Moffat

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
anticipating the day that Steven Moffat

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.180 
anticipating the day that Steven Moffat
leaves<00:06:12.960> just<00:06:13.320> because<00:06:13.560> he's<00:06:13.710> been<00:06:13.890> with<00:06:14.100> the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
leaves just because he's been with the

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.760 
leaves just because he's been with the
show<00:06:14.340> for<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> long<00:06:14.730> time<00:06:15.030> and<00:06:15.330> I<00:06:15.990> think<00:06:16.440> we<00:06:16.560> need

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
show for a long time and I think we need

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.930 
show for a long time and I think we need
some<00:06:17.370> fresh<00:06:18.000> ideas<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:19.050> people<00:06:19.740> in<00:06:20.250> with<00:06:20.700> the

some fresh ideas and people in with the
new<00:06:21.120> doctor<00:06:21.540> so<00:06:21.750> maybe<00:06:21.990> Steven<00:06:22.440> Moffat<00:06:22.620> will
