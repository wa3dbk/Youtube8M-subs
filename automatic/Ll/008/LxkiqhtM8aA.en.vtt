against the wall but we'll get into that
a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.609> bit<00:00:59.730> later

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a little bit later

now with the unit comes a docking

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
now with the unit comes a docking
station<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.609> serves<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> charging

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
station it also serves as a charging
station<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> has<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:05.640> AC

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
station as well because it has an AC

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
station as well because it has an AC
adapter<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.689> there's<00:01:06.869> already<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.320> AC

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
adapter on the actual unit itself seems

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.179 
adapter on the actual unit itself seems
kind<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.020> redundant<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> won't<00:01:10.799> complain

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
kind of redundant but I won't complain

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.730 
kind of redundant but I won't complain
about<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> extra<00:01:12.060> compatibility<00:01:12.990> there's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
about the extra compatibility there's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.210 
about the extra compatibility there's

speaker<00:01:40.500> itself<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.159> limited<00:01:41.759> now<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
speaker itself it is limited now the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.850 
speaker itself it is limited now the
speaker<00:01:42.689> itself<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.229> limited<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.770> its

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
speaker itself is limited in its

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
speaker itself is limited in its
functionality<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.270> capacity<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
functionality in the capacity that it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.340 
functionality in the capacity that it
can't<00:01:47.130> backwards<00:01:47.880> control<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.750> sound<00:01:49.020> source

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
can't backwards control the sound source

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.770 
can't backwards control the sound source
so<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.280> basic<00:01:50.729> functions<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.600> on

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so the basic functions that you have on

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.499 
so the basic functions that you have on
here<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.049> power<00:01:52.229> Bluetooth<00:01:52.920> mute<00:01:53.310> volume<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
here are power Bluetooth mute volume and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.440 
here are power Bluetooth mute volume and
aux<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.340> control<00:01:56.729> skipping<00:01:57.240> for

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
aux but you can't control skipping for

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.780 
aux but you can't control skipping for
track<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.200> winding<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.680> track<00:01:58.950> pausing<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.549> track

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
track or winding a track pausing a track

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.770 
track or winding a track pausing a track
or<00:01:59.939> anything<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
or anything like that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
or anything like that
in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> sound<00:02:02.159> capacity<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.479> your

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
in the sound capacity if you have your

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.050 
in the sound capacity if you have your
sound<00:02:03.899> source<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.320> 50<00:02:04.619> percent<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.460> maximum

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
sound source at 50 percent the maximum

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
sound source at 50 percent the maximum
that<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.570> push<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.110> 50<00:02:07.409> percent<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that it can push out is 50 percent of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
that it can push out is 50 percent of
that<00:02:07.920> volume<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.700> can't<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.239> control

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that volume so you can't really control

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
that volume so you can't really control
anything<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.009> an<00:02:11.129> outward<00:02:11.610> punch

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
anything it's more like an outward punch

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
anything it's more like an outward punch
from<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> sound<00:02:13.080> source<00:02:13.379> will

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
from what the sound source will

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
from what the sound source will
aiyoo<00:02:13.920> -<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.180> option<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.990> being

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
aiyoo - now this option not being

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.570 
aiyoo - now this option not being
available<00:02:16.530> may<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.250> little<00:02:17.430> bit

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
available may be a little bit

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250 
available may be a little bit
inconvenient<00:02:17.910> thing<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.080> just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
inconvenient thing for some so I just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.690 
inconvenient thing for some so I just
wanted<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> point<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.370> Bluetooth

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
wanted to point that out the Bluetooth

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.130 
wanted to point that out the Bluetooth
does<00:02:20.880> work<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.450> let's<00:02:21.600> take<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.960> at<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
does work well so let's take a look at a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.550 
does work well so let's take a look at a
clip<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.410> me<00:02:22.740> outside<00:02:23.000> testing<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> distance

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 

so<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:32.940> walking<00:02:33.120> outside

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so as you can see I'm walking outside

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.940 
so as you can see I'm walking outside
and<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:33.990> kind<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.350> pausing<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.830> that's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and I'm kind of pausing and that's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
and I'm kind of pausing and that's
because<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> Bluetooth<00:02:35.790> actually<00:02:36.150> cut<00:02:36.450> out

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
because the Bluetooth actually cut out

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.390 
because the Bluetooth actually cut out
but<00:02:36.870> then<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.140> reconnected<00:02:37.680> nose<00:02:37.830> full<00:02:38.069> force

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
but then it reconnected nose full force

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.550 
but then it reconnected nose full force
when<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.819> got<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> end<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.110> Bluetooth

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
when I got to the end the Bluetooth

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
when I got to the end the Bluetooth
signal<00:02:41.069> finally<00:02:41.430> cut<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.270> could<00:02:42.540> still

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
signal finally cut out but I could still

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.260 
signal finally cut out but I could still
hear<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.290> music<00:02:43.530> clearly<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.880> point<00:02:45.120> when

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
hear the music clearly at the point when

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.640 
hear the music clearly at the point when
it<00:02:45.390> did<00:02:45.569> cut<00:02:45.810> out<00:02:45.990> also<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.560> was

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it did cut out also there was

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
it did cut out also there was
landscaping<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.520> on

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
landscaping going on

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.550 
landscaping going on
some<00:02:48.000> guys<00:02:48.150> were<00:02:48.300> mowing<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.750> lawn<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.020> mowing

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
some guys were mowing the lawn or mowing

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
some guys were mowing the lawn or mowing
the<00:02:49.800> greenery<00:02:50.340> somewhere<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.209> still<00:02:51.600> could

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the greenery somewhere and I still could

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.809 
the greenery somewhere and I still could
hear<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.260> with<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.860> interference<00:02:53.580> so

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
hear that with all that interference so

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.240 
hear that with all that interference so
imagine<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.660> sound<00:02:55.050> capacity<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:56.010> when

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
imagine this sound capacity of when

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070 
imagine this sound capacity of when
you're<00:02:56.400> inside<00:02:56.700> an<00:02:56.850> office<00:02:57.330> or<00:02:57.540> inside<00:02:57.870> your

you're inside an office or inside your

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.490 
you're inside an office or inside your
den<00:02:58.319> or<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.830> home<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.819> powerful

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
den or your home it's really powerful

just really impactful now what like I
said<00:03:21.300> before<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.050> Bose<00:03:22.890> logo<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.880> an

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
said before the Bose logo is an

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
said before the Bose logo is an
indicator<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.690> where<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> front<00:03:25.680> speakers

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
indicator of where the front speakers

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.610 
indicator of where the front speakers
are<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.060> back<00:03:27.420> speaker<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.140> though<00:03:28.350> they

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
are but the back speaker is though they

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.559 
are but the back speaker is though they
push<00:03:28.920> out<00:03:29.100> lower<00:03:29.430> tones<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.060> what<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.360> does

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
push out lower tones and what it does

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.630 
push out lower tones and what it does
the<00:03:31.350> reason<00:03:31.590> why<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.980> important<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the reason why this is important is

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.610 
the reason why this is important is
because<00:03:32.700> there's<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.450> speaker<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.110> back<00:03:34.290> if

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because there's a speaker on the back if

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.340 
because there's a speaker on the back if
you<00:03:34.830> put<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.459> next<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.060> wall<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.630> creates

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
you put this next to a wall it creates

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.930 
you put this next to a wall it creates
like<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> reverb<00:03:37.980> effect<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:38.700> what<00:03:38.910> that

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
like a reverb effect now what that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.090 
like a reverb effect now what that
reverb<00:03:39.450> effect<00:03:39.840> will<00:03:40.019> do<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.530> explain<00:03:40.950> is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
reverb effect will do just explain is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860 
reverb effect will do just explain is
kind<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.519> an<00:03:41.640> echo<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.269> you're<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.630> cave

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
kind of like an echo if you're in a cave

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.259 
kind of like an echo if you're in a cave
and<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> say<00:03:43.350> hello<00:03:43.890> hello

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
and you say hello hello

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.520 
and you say hello hello
well<00:03:45.450> what<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.720> sound<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.110> doing<00:03:46.380> is

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
well what that sound is doing is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
well what that sound is doing is
bouncing<00:03:46.980> off<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.310> walls<00:03:47.519> right<00:03:47.820> because

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
bouncing off the walls right because

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.850 
bouncing off the walls right because
that's<00:03:48.120> what<00:03:48.269> sound<00:03:48.480> does<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.350> travels

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
that's what sound does it it's travels

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.170 
that's what sound does it it's travels
and<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.070> has<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> ability<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.640> bounce<00:03:51.000> off

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
and it has the ability to bounce off

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.340 
and it has the ability to bounce off
walls<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.790> if<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.910> put<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.420> next<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
walls so if you put this next to the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.830 
walls so if you put this next to the
wall<00:03:55.730> what's<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> happen<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.600> lower

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
wall what's going to happen is the lower

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.500 
wall what's going to happen is the lower
tones<00:03:58.200> from<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.769> back<00:03:59.040> will<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.489> pushed<00:03:59.850> out

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
tones from the back will be pushed out

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.979 
tones from the back will be pushed out
and<00:04:01.070> then<00:04:02.070> bounce<00:04:02.430> off<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.850> wall<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.269> travels

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and then bounce off the wall and travels

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.140 
and then bounce off the wall and travels
with<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> music<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.100> firing<00:04:05.790> through

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
with the music that is firing through

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.449 
with the music that is firing through
the<00:04:06.239> front<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.049> there<00:04:07.620> are<00:04:07.859> bass<00:04:08.160> tones

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
the front so that there are bass tones

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.770 
the front so that there are bass tones
at<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.609> fire<00:04:08.820> through<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.150> front<00:04:09.480> but<00:04:09.630> there's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
