special summon facedown but at the same

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.460 
special summon facedown but at the same
time<00:01:54.030> has<00:01:54.240> no<00:01:54.329> name<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> can't<00:01:55.200> determine

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
time has no name so you can't determine

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
time has no name so you can't determine
that<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.610> strange<00:01:56.939> ruling<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> card

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that but the strange ruling on this card

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.639 
that but the strange ruling on this card
is<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.409> set<00:01:58.710> um<00:01:59.240> sacrifice<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.649> climate

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
is you can set um sacrifice on climate

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
is you can set um sacrifice on climate
change<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> believe<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.640> laser<00:02:02.969> cliff

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
change and I believe also laser cliff

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.249 
change and I believe also laser cliff
I'm<00:02:03.329> pretty<00:02:03.479> sure<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.719> also<00:02:03.840> set<00:02:04.049> laser

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
I'm pretty sure you can also set laser

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.550 
I'm pretty sure you can also set laser
clip<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> reason<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.320> because

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
clip and the reason for that is because

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
clip and the reason for that is because
they<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.429> plea<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> clean<00:02:09.660> their<00:02:09.869> name

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
they are plea they have clean their name

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
they are plea they have clean their name
which<00:02:10.560> means<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:11.069> their<00:02:11.190> special<00:02:11.489> summon

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
which means when their special summon

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
which means when their special summon
they're<00:02:11.819> basically<00:02:12.090> treated<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.480> clean

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
they're basically treated as clean

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.000 
they're basically treated as clean
monsters

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
monsters

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.100 
monsters
however<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.870> do<00:02:15.959> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
however you can do that you can do that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.270 
however you can do that you can do that
obviously<00:02:16.200> when<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> scale<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
obviously when you have a scale but you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.910 
obviously when you have a scale but you
cannot<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:17.940> with<00:02:18.330> months<00:02:18.840> cards<00:02:19.560> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
cannot do that with months cards that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
cannot do that with months cards that
are<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.310> sacrifice<00:02:21.000> climate<00:02:21.840> change<00:02:22.050> or

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
are not sacrifice climate change or

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.110 
are not sacrifice climate change or
laser<00:02:22.470> click<00:02:22.770> or<00:02:22.920> any<00:02:23.099> other<00:02:23.280> likely<00:02:23.790> traps

laser click or any other likely traps

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.580 
laser click or any other likely traps
but<00:02:24.300> nobody<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:24.750> runs<00:02:24.959> anything<00:02:25.230> outside

have clean their name when you have

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.540 
have clean their name when you have
scales<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:28.739> means<00:02:28.950> you're<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:29.310> special

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
scales which means you're not special

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
people have been doing that when they

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.699 
people have been doing that when they

figure<00:03:20.160> people<00:03:20.370> don't<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.269> about<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.630> or

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
figure people don't know about this or

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.259 
figure people don't know about this or
just<00:03:21.870> haven't<00:03:22.260> seen<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.440> or<00:03:22.709> they<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:24.090> just

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
just haven't seen it or they really just

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.310 
just haven't seen it or they really just
haven't<00:03:24.480> come<00:03:24.570> across<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.200> has

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
haven't come across it but it has

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.840 
haven't come across it but it has
happened<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.709> me<00:03:25.829> at<00:03:25.920> least<00:03:26.010> twice<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.519> far<00:03:26.700> and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
happened to me at least twice so far and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.050 
happened to me at least twice so far and
I've<00:03:26.910> seen<00:03:27.060> other<00:03:27.239> people<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.930> duels<00:03:28.140> um

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I've seen other people do it in duels um

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.039 
I've seen other people do it in duels um
so<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.180> just<00:03:30.359> something<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.780> aware<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
so it's just something to be aware of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.259 
so it's just something to be aware of
it's<00:03:31.920> not<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> card<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> every<00:03:32.640> deck<00:03:32.790> early<00:03:33.030> uses

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it's not a card to every deck early uses

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.190 
it's not a card to every deck early uses
it's<00:03:33.390> actually<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.630> card<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:33.959> never<00:03:34.109> really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it's actually a card that's never really

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860 
it's actually a card that's never really
seen<00:03:34.590> competitive<00:03:35.160> play<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> yeah<00:03:36.660> neither

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
seen competitive play so yeah neither

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.120 
seen competitive play so yeah neither
glad<00:03:37.170> it's<00:03:37.320> pretty<00:03:37.470> cool<00:03:37.560> card<00:03:37.799> but<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> think

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
glad it's pretty cool card but I think

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.009 
glad it's pretty cool card but I think
it's<00:03:38.250> gimmicky<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.760> guess<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.750> kind<00:03:39.989> of

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
it's gimmicky I guess this is kind of

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.920 
it's gimmicky I guess this is kind of
like<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.200> carter<00:03:40.440> view<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.739> really<00:03:41.100> um

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
like a carter view but not really um

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.319 
like a carter view but not really um
this<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.109> i'll<00:03:43.320> let<00:03:43.890> people<00:03:44.250> know<00:03:44.609> of

this is just i'll let people know of

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.970 
this is just i'll let people know of
some<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.630> dangers<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.019> either<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.410> using

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
some of the dangers of either a using

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.509 
some of the dangers of either a using
this<00:03:47.070> card<00:03:47.340> or<00:03:47.640> playing<00:03:48.060> against<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:49.250> yeah<00:03:50.250> so

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
this card or playing against it yeah so

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.180
