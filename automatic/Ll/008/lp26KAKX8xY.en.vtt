00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.210 
why that that kind of engagement can be
so<00:02:08.250> valuable<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.780> why<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.530> such<00:02:11.160> a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
about the end consumer and therefore

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.059 
about the end consumer and therefore
there's<00:04:09.579> a<00:04:09.639> lot<00:04:10.030> that's<00:04:10.269> lost<00:04:10.599> lost<00:04:11.139> out<00:04:11.439> it's

which<00:04:19.780> does<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> pitch<00:04:20.229> then<00:04:20.530> there's<00:04:20.739> a

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
which does a pitch then there's a

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.189 
which does a pitch then there's a
creative<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.729> each<00:04:22.060> process<00:04:22.570> by<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.020> time

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
creative and in each process by the time

talked<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.840> lot<00:04:26.259> and<00:04:26.470> therefore<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.190> brand<00:04:27.400> is

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
talked a lot and therefore the brand is

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.060 
talked a lot and therefore the brand is
not<00:04:27.759> doing<00:04:28.030> communications<00:04:28.659> job<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.530> PR<00:04:29.889> is

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070

eight months back I do believe it's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.879 
eight months back I do believe it's
about<00:05:45.729> cost<00:05:46.389> but<00:05:47.110> I<00:05:47.139> also<00:05:47.200> believe<00:05:47.410> it's<00:05:47.740> about
