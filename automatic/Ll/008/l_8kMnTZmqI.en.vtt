insane<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.610> actually

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
insane so you see there's actually

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
insane so you see there's actually
complicated<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> lever

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
complicated like a kind of like a lever

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
complicated like a kind of like a lever
mechanism<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.720> spring

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
mechanism and can like a little spring

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.889 
mechanism and can like a little spring
mechanism<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> inside<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.780> have

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mechanism on the inside so and you have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
mechanism on the inside so and you have
like<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> flip<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> stick<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> funky

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
like a flip you stick and a funky

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the spring but once you overcome the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
the spring but once you overcome the
center<00:01:52.439> point<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.340> spring<00:01:53.759> starts<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.659> work

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
center point the spring starts to work

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
center point the spring starts to work
for<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.950> kinda<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.610> looks

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like it's spring a sistah just starts

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.950 
like it's spring a sistah just starts
bending<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.610> other<00:01:59.640> way<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.780> your

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bending the other way and you know your

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
bending the other way and you know your
work<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> overcome<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> center<00:02:02.310> point

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
work on this overcome the center point

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.130 
work on this overcome the center point
and<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.390> why<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.780> open<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and just why it's open the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.350 
and just why it's open the
thumps<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.250> actually<00:02:07.640> stopped<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.270> an

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
thumps that is actually stopped in an

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.050 
thumps that is actually stopped in an
open<00:02:08.720> position<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.280> also<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.790> and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
open position and so is also this and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.730 
open position and so is also this and
the<00:02:11.180> cool<00:02:11.420> thing<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the cool thing is know is that the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.170 
the cool thing is know is that the
handle<00:02:13.100> load<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> bottom<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> handle

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
handle load is the bottom of the handle

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.370 
handle load is the bottom of the handle
what<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.660> does<00:02:15.640> see<00:02:16.640> how<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.480> travels<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
what it does see how it travels back and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.610 
what it does see how it travels back and
forth<00:02:18.620> kinda<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.540> even<00:02:20.960> though<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.200> non

the function so not gonna be scores cast

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.909 
the function so not gonna be scores cast
I'm<00:05:12.930> not<00:05:13.050> even<00:05:13.229> close

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
I'm not even close

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.000 
I'm not even close
I<00:05:13.949> suppose<00:05:14.430> custom<00:05:14.909> but<00:05:15.169> it<00:05:16.169> would<00:05:16.380> be<00:05:16.620> pretty

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
I suppose custom but it would be pretty

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.010 
I suppose custom but it would be pretty
cool<00:05:17.130> solution<00:05:18.030> for<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.630> know<00:05:18.750> for

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
cool solution for you know for

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.520 
cool solution for you know for
reasonable<00:05:19.590> price<00:05:20.270> we're<00:05:21.270> getting<00:05:21.599> this<00:05:21.750> but

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
reasonable price we're getting this but

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.159 
reasonable price we're getting this but
University<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.400> don't<00:05:23.610> think<00:05:23.970> even<00:05:24.300> blockers<00:05:24.810> I

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
University I don't think even blockers I

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.930 
University I don't think even blockers I
think<00:05:25.740> even<00:05:25.919> when<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.280> blocker<00:05:26.490> would<00:05:26.729> make

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
think even when the blocker would make

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.000 
think even when the blocker would make
it<00:05:27.180> another<00:05:28.020> thing<00:05:28.199> it's<00:05:28.320> gonna<00:05:28.470> be<00:05:28.650> achieved

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
it another thing it's gonna be achieved

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.659 
it another thing it's gonna be achieved
because<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.960> amount<00:05:31.260> of<00:05:31.380> machining<00:05:31.889> in<00:05:31.979> parts

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
because the amount of machining in parts

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.149 
because the amount of machining in parts
would<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.479> need<00:05:34.689> to<00:05:34.749> put<00:05:35.169> this<00:05:35.319> together<00:05:35.530> to

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
would you need to put this together to

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.550

work<00:05:36.370> like<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.930> there<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:37.960> know<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:38.439> is

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
work like this there you know that is

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.589 
work like this there you know that is
not<00:05:38.919> frame<00:05:39.729> like<00:05:39.969> this<00:05:39.999> it's<00:05:40.240> not<00:05:40.330> lighting

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
complicated than that so I think that I

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.010 
complicated than that so I think that I
don't<00:05:46.960> um<00:05:47.460> I'm<00:05:48.460> kind<00:05:48.699> of<00:05:48.729> scared<00:05:49.029> that<00:05:49.120> even

like<00:05:53.439> this<00:05:53.560> it's<00:05:53.800> gonna<00:05:53.919> be<00:05:54.009> pretty<00:05:54.279> pricey<00:05:54.719> as

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
like this it's gonna be pretty pricey as

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.589 
like this it's gonna be pretty pricey as
it<00:05:55.870> is<00:05:56.020> there's<00:05:56.409> a<00:05:56.469> lot<00:05:56.770> lot<00:05:57.279> of<00:05:57.789> engineering<00:05:58.509> a

it is there's a lot lot of engineering a

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.110 
it is there's a lot lot of engineering a

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
like this together so I think even the

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.580 
like this together so I think even the
production<00:06:04.360> version<00:06:04.509> is<00:06:04.840> not<00:06:05.080> gonna<00:06:05.229> be<00:06:05.409> very

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.420 
production version is not gonna be very
