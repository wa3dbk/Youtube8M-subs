00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.420
 what I like about sailing is that it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.320
 it's still a sport adventure like 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.290
 mountain sports 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.219
 it's a bit of self-transcendence 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.989
 maneuver and lead a boat like 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.250
 it's a 40 feet or a 60 feet in 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.800
 solitary in the middle atlantic 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.350
 it's still something fabulous 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.610
 difficult moments there are moments 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.050
 of dream when sliding in the trade winds 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.339
 his spinnaker that we're all alone aboard 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.350
 his boat we are we are the king of the world 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.700
 is a space of freedom that I have 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.700
 never met in lyon 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 I am lucky to live in big happiness 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.210
 on the arcachon basin side 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.200
 one day I came across the road a 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.940
 great browser called yves 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 talker who took me with him to do 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.659
 great crewed races on these 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.190
 big boats so I was able to learn 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.360
 alongside the best and one day I 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.400
 here is minute made fly capable 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 also crossed the Atlantic alone and 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.680
 so I left like this on the mini 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 sunbed in 98 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.850
 in the voice there are several aspects 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.560
 it's first of all a mechanical sport so a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 strong technological aspect and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.799
 secondly it's a sport 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.299
 in quotation marks 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.590
 since what drives us to go 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.270
 quickly it's the wind so we use the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.649
 natural elements to move forward and the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.030
 third parameter which is very 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.250
 interesting is the strategic part 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.619
 and tactical particular about the options 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 weather with many multitudes of roads 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.360
 which opens before us since the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.360
 playground is huge 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.550
 I had maths and on the sold globe 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.330
 it was finished playing all the time 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.090
 talk about racing off 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.220
 here it is I ordered is here and I 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 dedicated myself to my company 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 that's why it was bad for a 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.740
 well and then very quickly the pressure is 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 income I left I won at 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.540
 jacques vabre in shoots at my 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.540
 relaunch and that's it 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.560
 after winning the mini-transat the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 jacques vabre the rum road is a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 race that I ordered to win too I 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.620
 gives me the means to get there and 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 I am lucky to be accompanied by a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.680
 very nice partners so I do not have 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.680
 of reasons these instructions
