00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.689
 I am an absolute limp 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.160
 some time ago I wrote about what 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.230
 google dancers need to tip 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 not what you need but it would be cool 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 introduce such a culture rate as if to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 such etiquette let's say so under this 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.490
 implied suppose if i come 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 the club so I look there is some 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 go-go dancer dancing if well so like 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 I stole an ass and left no man what 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 bad, well, just looked all cool 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 she dances all too cool but I just 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 I know it myself saw such situations that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 dudes just like that at the bar stand and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 just lives with her eyes 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 cool dancer who 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 professionally she already sees that on her 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 the flight begins to live on it too 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 and monet and wink making fun then 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 There is essentially already in some such 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 more or less private dance 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 despite being on stage for everyone 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 dancing as if but not yet on her 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 look all there sausage and this one specifically 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 despite the head already with him 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:06.540
 contacts went and the believers say 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.540
 just in Russian but I don't know so well 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.580
 this is the most eye contact and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.310
 roughly a minute more like he 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799
 it takes more than minutes or I am now 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 I emphasize I do not mention the words 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.729
 duty what is duty or 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 some kind of norm there or directly related to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.320
 Kalashnikov fit well bastard class 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.829
 no, it was cool how good 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 beautiful tone that yes I love you for a long time 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 I wanted to use your resources 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.119
 graphic hapki shaft there something 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.890
 some kind of a penny yes there 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 something I feel sorry for all the same went well again 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.649
 earned bullshit ok in this plan 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 tell that is if it is already 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.759
 turns into such a devouring gaze 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 but it would be cool to pay but at the same time 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.439
 nor is it a duty 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.210
 nobody owes anything to anyone like 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.600
 waiters in a restaurant or is there a barman and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.219
 here they are there further you and not all give 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.450
 I don’t even know many 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.719
 would such a culture and why google 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.280
 don't actually give up to a stripper 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.560
 By the way, too, many are confused that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.210
 stripper gives what you only for 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 private dance nifiga 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.020
 did you pay for the entrance to the strip club 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.220
 for example or even free admission 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.330
 you can sit at all 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.580
 look at the strippers 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.290
 and generally leave nothing to give she 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.880
 dancing too on a pole for all there a bunch 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.270
 men looking who wants just grandmother and 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.240
 throws at her and all the problems are very 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.400
 like this you can show how 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.680
 you are pretty and this is the dancer 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.980
 of all the others and generally because 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.320
 we have the world of money is money you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.600
 you can show it off but what's the problem 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.260
 possible if we had internet money 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.250
 would be canceled 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.250
 could there be a basket of potatoes and give 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.080
 eat for example I do not know where dare as 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 cynicism but many wrote an example to me 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.700
 theater giving now too you 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.730
 toys man that is there too somehow 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.200
 it would try even to all it immediately then 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.060
 stinginess earning money 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 mentioned not even about the day talking about 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.700
 tipping well it could be in the form of money 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.340
 tea coffee sausage 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.470
 bouquet of roses it was even more pleasant 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
 than money money we have here about it 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.450
 that is , talking about it that is when 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.160
 do you live look well let's somehow or 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.680
 share it or so think okay 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
 something too chewing our eyes somehow 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.280
 Unusually well, everything, I went better 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.480
 then what and nifiga yes and what and what 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 comes to don't go on here one lamp 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.400
 pony went there just about these 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.190
 spoke here and how of course these here 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.630
 bayans taken already in the comments you went 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.580
 in vain of course you start arguing and why 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.090
 rough there he is not needed just not needed 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.190
 because people have such a habit 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.620
 they very often don’t like the idea itself 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.270
 and how it lends itself to any tone and 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.130
 they are already starting to cling to this ton 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.470
 to this messenger they are to his exe 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.390
 cool so here and here therefore they 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.890
 start already saying yes what am i doing there 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.280
 wryly many behind the shields still pay 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.870
 should 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.310
 not surely should not so on them and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.500
 watch no more than 1 ton bowleg 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.060
 I like them correctly the essence of what 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.370
 if there will even be dtsp augers 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.190
 disabled handheld voice 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.260
 burnt faces dance if you 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.930
 you will see more minutes on them and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.850
 you are about to have a new poets culture 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.130
 would even give them a class 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.020
 regard tips and so like it therefore 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.720
 and crooked legs if you look more 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.750
 minutes and humped backs if you can 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.270
 more than a minute and 100 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.410
 women you can kagan big drow already 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.030
 too long would be cool 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.040
 show this alternate 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.310
 perhaps yes it seems to me in europe that is not 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.700
 The question is probably also from earnings 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.210
 much depends you understand when you remember 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.310
 like we were there in spain there people 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.280
 why like u ride on ordinary cars 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.980
 because everyone has the level of earnings 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.720
 equally tall good and everything is cool on 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.180
 the resort yes we were yes and all 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.150
 good soaked wrinkles in cars and 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.160
 phones are simple, but we have yesterday's slave 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.720
 went to riches he wants immediately well before 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.150
 their former tribesmen 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.490
 pontanutsya and now we get it at 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.350
 we don't have such a middle class ok 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.370
 we are either completely richer and completely 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.910
 nothing 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.770
 that's often your start to fall 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.360
 this buddy hiding behind that type there 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.520
 starts to somehow rationalize 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.169
 some evidence from my cashier in 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.630
 Rome to bring completely inappropriate 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.850
 if you want to talk about cashier 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.880
 it is a separate talk yet nothing about it 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.790
 say and there most likely you too 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.250
 lose yes because while you 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.110
 lost i was sitting behind a book mad file 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.990
 but only because of me you play 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.750
 in the fact that you more women I treat me this 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.430
 yes so this is a separate topic now we 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.169
 all we say is all this 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.090
 square about the topic tip goal goal 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.040
 there is no other subject 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.080
 comparisons are no longer theater and me 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.610
 give me examples of no hour 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.770
 Need examples we are talking only about this and 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.200
 we are not saying that it is the duty of law 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.300
 or a mouse from someone we hate for it goes 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.370
 this is such thinking out loud a 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.620
 damn series and it would be cool 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.850
 element of worship would be nice 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.330
 Yes, it would be nice and those boys 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.580
 this is hooked this topic can they both 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.419
 will come and already for their sake 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.729
 it said 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.560
 and all those who disagree there is no 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.810
 sense to argue with them because never 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.580
 man will not say so eureka your words 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.220
 influenced me now i 'm gonna go give 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.410
 grandmothers on their ass before this never 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.140
 will therefore he will not throw in 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:37.349
 better pivas take yes okay it's his business 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:39.320
 of course yes that's why those guys are 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.390
 as if awkwardly can 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.320
 I even wanted food for what you think somehow 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.020
 embarrassing lead 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:50.570
 by keenly seeks no problem there i'm 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.820
 even wrote to listen and how it all 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.010
 until a tip is given you are just taken and 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.010
 extends or passes through the bar 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.150
 so it's new that you can write that 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.920
 without even paying to those people with 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.380
 they will not agree with that 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.410
 pay the end but here's a better code who 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.450
 agree with this cultural norm conclusion we 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.760
 we explain how to pass chill and either 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.180
 stretch a girl straight onto the stage 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.620
 pleasure to take either somehow 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.840
 wait until the scenes come off either there 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.490
 if quite some kind of inventor dude 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.930
 Right you want to give a basket of flowers 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.940
 then there via courier or via 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.160
 guard somehow you can all agree 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.720
 easy to do everything is normal composition 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.470
 do not need all the fun here so that all 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.470
 said kind and
