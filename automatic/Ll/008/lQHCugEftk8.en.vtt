00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
highly useful I noticed that in the last

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.260 
highly useful I noticed that in the last
episode<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.039> didn't<00:00:40.250> talk<00:00:40.430> too<00:00:40.700> much<00:00:40.850> about<00:00:40.910> the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
episode I didn't talk too much about the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.119 
episode I didn't talk too much about the
gameplay<00:00:41.719> aspects<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.559> think<00:00:42.770> I'm<00:00:43.010> gonna

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
gameplay aspects so I think I'm gonna

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.860 
gameplay aspects so I think I'm gonna
talk<00:00:43.280> about<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.579> now<00:00:46.059> basically<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.660> game

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
talk about it now basically this game

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.990 
talk about it now basically this game
follows<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.710> standard<00:00:48.980> formula<00:00:49.520> of<00:00:49.699> pretty

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
follows the standard formula of pretty

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.880 
follows the standard formula of pretty
much<00:00:50.090> every<00:00:50.480> Metroid<00:00:50.840> game<00:00:51.020> in<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.410> you

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
much every Metroid game in that you

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.410 
much every Metroid game in that you
start<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.250> game<00:00:52.280> with<00:00:52.460> little<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.390> no

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
start the game with little to no

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.479 
start the game with little to no
abilities<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.199> then<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.500> slowly<00:00:54.770> recover<00:00:55.219> as

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
abilities and then you slowly recover as

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.979 
abilities and then you slowly recover as
much<00:00:55.520> as<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.969> feel<00:00:56.000> comfortable<00:00:56.149> recovering

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
much as you feel comfortable recovering

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.200 
much as you feel comfortable recovering
or<00:00:57.140> as<00:00:57.230> much<00:00:57.379> as<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.590> need<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:58.519> finish<00:00:58.789> the

globe or whatever anyway apparently they

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.770 
globe or whatever anyway apparently they
evolved<00:02:21.080> into<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.910> blithering<00:02:22.910> idiot<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.600> a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
evolved into this blithering idiot of a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.229 
evolved into this blithering idiot of a
Metroid<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.560> know<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.430> been<00:02:25.549> discussed<00:02:25.940> that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
Metroid I know it's been discussed that

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.320 
Metroid I know it's been discussed that
they're<00:02:26.390> actually<00:02:26.600> they<00:02:27.560> seem<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:27.769> a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
they're actually they seem like a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.370 
they're actually they seem like a
de-evolution<00:02:29.330> more<00:02:29.569> than<00:02:29.750> anything<00:02:29.959> but

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
de-evolution more than anything but

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.170 
de-evolution more than anything but
that's<00:02:31.010> okay<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.549> just<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.760> step<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
that's okay it's just a step in the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.210 
that's okay it's just a step in the
right<00:02:32.299> direction<00:02:32.360> because<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.860> they<00:02:33.950> become

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
right direction because what they become

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.660 
right direction because what they become
is<00:02:34.519> something<00:02:34.970> more<00:02:35.090> awesome<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:37.370> we'll<00:02:37.489> talk

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
is something more awesome but we'll talk

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.479 
is something more awesome but we'll talk
about<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.030> when<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:38.450> see<00:02:38.750> one<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.400> don't<00:02:40.400> want

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
about that when we see one I don't want

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.460 
about that when we see one I don't want
to<00:02:40.640> get<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.850> little<00:02:41.000> ahead<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.450> myself<00:02:41.630> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to get a little ahead of myself that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.349 
to get a little ahead of myself that
tangle<00:02:43.250> we<00:02:43.340> did<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.609> see<00:02:43.730> down<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.970> bottom<00:02:44.000> is

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
tangle we did you see down the bottom is

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.789 
tangle we did you see down the bottom is
something<00:02:44.780> pretty<00:02:44.900> nasty<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> want<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.709> get

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
something pretty nasty I want to get

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.080 
something pretty nasty I want to get
caught<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:46.609> it<00:02:46.730> slows<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> down

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
caught in it because it slows you down

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.729 
caught in it because it slows you down
and<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.570> slowly<00:02:47.900> drains<00:02:48.260> your<00:02:48.470> health<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
let's not get caught in it right exactly

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.890 
let's not get caught in it right exactly
alright<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.670> all<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.510> Metroid's

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
going to be going left through this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.270 
going to be going left through this
shaft<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.730> all<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.450> way<00:03:20.569> out<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:20.810> here

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
shaft and up and all the way out of here

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.370 
shaft and up and all the way out of here
back<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.579> lake<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.420> acid<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.840> we<00:03:24.079> passed

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
back to a lake of acid that we passed

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.840 
back to a lake of acid that we passed
earlier<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.950> don't<00:03:25.069> know<00:03:25.220> if<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> noticed<00:03:25.700> it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
earlier I don't know if you noticed it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.660 
earlier I don't know if you noticed it
but<00:03:26.030> that's<00:03:26.840> where<00:03:27.079> we're<00:03:27.200> going

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.430 

and<00:03:30.670> there'll<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.210> lake<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.930> once<00:03:32.230> we<00:03:32.350> get

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and there'll be lake so once we get

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.770 
and there'll be lake so once we get
there<00:03:32.680> we're<00:03:33.010> gonna<00:03:33.100> go<00:03:33.220> down<00:03:33.400> into<00:03:33.940> area<00:03:34.540> two

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
there we're gonna go down into area two

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.250 
there we're gonna go down into area two
which<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.470> pretty<00:03:35.830> fun<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:37.720> much<00:03:38.020> larger

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
which is pretty fun it's much larger

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.790 
which is pretty fun it's much larger
than<00:03:38.500> area<00:03:38.860> one<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.880> surface<00:03:40.180> area<00:03:40.480> but

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
than area one and the surface area but

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.400 
than area one and the surface area but
anyway<00:03:42.090> that's<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:43.990> it<00:03:44.290> was

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
anyway that's that I know it was

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.850 
anyway that's that I know it was
mentioned<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.170> would<00:03:47.320> be<00:03:47.440> really<00:03:47.710> neat

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
mentioned that it would be really neat

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.260 
mentioned that it would be really neat
if<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.040> can<00:03:48.190> find<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> way<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.520> fit<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> map<00:03:48.970> into

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
if I can find a way to fit the map into

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.730 
if I can find a way to fit the map into
the<00:03:49.360> game<00:03:49.510> now<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.870> don't<00:03:50.200> know<00:03:50.350> if<00:03:50.500> I'll<00:03:50.620> be

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
the game now I don't know if I'll be

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.780 
the game now I don't know if I'll be
able<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.890> get<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.130> up<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.670> screen

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
able to get it up to on the screen

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.820 
able to get it up to on the screen
constantly<00:03:52.600> like<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:53.020> see<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.410> Super<00:03:53.680> Metroid

or<00:03:54.370> anything<00:03:54.610> like<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:54.880> but<00:03:55.350> occasionally<00:03:56.350> I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
or anything like that but occasionally I

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.640 
or anything like that but occasionally I
will<00:03:56.590> take<00:03:56.980> little<00:03:57.610> breaks<00:03:57.730> or<00:03:58.150> use

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
will take little breaks or use

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.230 
will take little breaks or use
backtracking<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.890> stuff<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
backtracking and stuff like that to

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.960 
backtracking and stuff like that to
check<00:04:01.420> out<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> map<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.380> area<00:04:02.650> 2<00:04:03.010> as

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
check out the map so this is area 2 as

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.370 
check out the map so this is area 2 as
you<00:04:04.150> can<00:04:04.270> see<00:04:04.390> lots<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.690> goodies<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.960> collect<00:04:05.290> I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
you can see lots of goodies to collect I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.530 
you can see lots of goodies to collect I
see<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> wave<00:04:05.800> beam<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.220> various<00:04:06.520> suit<00:04:06.760> lots<00:04:07.450> of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
see a wave beam of various suit lots of

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.740 
see a wave beam of various suit lots of
missile<00:04:07.840> upgrades<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:10.060> got<00:04:10.210> good<00:04:10.390> stuff<00:04:10.600> ahead

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
missile upgrades we got good stuff ahead

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.860 
missile upgrades we got good stuff ahead
of<00:04:10.870> us<00:04:11.080> don't<00:04:11.350> we

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
of us don't we

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.860 
of us don't we
so<00:04:13.870> as<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.590> can<00:04:14.680> see<00:04:14.740> it<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.160> fairly<00:04:15.190> large<00:04:15.870> but

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
so as you can see it is fairly large but

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.210 
so as you can see it is fairly large but
and<00:04:17.200> there's<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> little<00:04:17.620> bit<00:04:17.710> more<00:04:17.860> down<00:04:18.040> to

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
and there's a little bit more down to

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.470 
and there's a little bit more down to
the<00:04:18.280> bottom<00:04:18.489> left<00:04:18.610> but<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.850> didn't<00:04:19.239> feel<00:04:19.360> like

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
the bottom left but I didn't feel like

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.450 
the bottom left but I didn't feel like
it<00:04:19.750> again<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.200> will<00:04:20.350> see<00:04:20.500> what<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.890> on<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
it again we will see what that is on the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.420 
it again we will see what that is on the
way<00:04:22.380> it's<00:04:23.380> still<00:04:23.560> filled<00:04:23.710> with<00:04:23.740> Apple<00:04:24.070> Metroid

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
way it's still filled with Apple Metroid

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.330 
way it's still filled with Apple Metroid
so<00:04:24.790> let's<00:04:25.450> get<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:26.980> Lake<00:04:27.190> of

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
so let's get to it this is that Lake of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.700 
so let's get to it this is that Lake of
acid<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.670> was<00:04:27.790> speaking<00:04:28.060> about<00:04:28.180> earlier

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
acid I was speaking about earlier

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.380 
acid I was speaking about earlier
although<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.040> no<00:04:30.220> longer<00:04:30.340> acid<00:04:30.880> we<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.180> go

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
although it is no longer acid we can go

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.510 
although it is no longer acid we can go
down

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.040 

basically<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.539> formula<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.789> if<00:04:38.789> you<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:39.810> find

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
basically the formula is if you can find

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.689 
basically the formula is if you can find
the<00:04:40.199> rooms<00:04:40.410> where<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.009> the<00:04:41.130> music<00:04:41.520> this

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
the rooms where this is the music this

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.960 
the rooms where this is the music this
is<00:04:41.910> basically<00:04:42.300> your<00:04:43.340> descending<00:04:44.340> music<00:04:44.789> in

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
is basically your descending music in

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.850 
is basically your descending music in
that<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:46.139> music<00:04:46.319> the<00:04:46.470> place<00:04:46.650> in<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
that this is the music the place in the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.939 
that this is the music the place in the
areas<00:04:47.190> where<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.430> acid<00:04:47.819> Falls<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.800> if<00:04:49.800> you're

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
areas where the acid Falls so if you're

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.529 
areas where the acid Falls so if you're
unsure<00:04:50.069> where<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> go<00:04:50.610> go<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.210> area<00:04:51.360> that

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
unsure where to go go to the area that

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.120 
unsure where to go go to the area that
plays<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:51.870> music<00:04:52.259> see<00:04:52.410> if<00:04:52.500> there's<00:04:52.680> acid<00:04:53.009> if

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
plays this music see if there's acid if

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.279 
plays this music see if there's acid if
there<00:04:53.280> isn't<00:04:53.569> continue<00:04:54.569> downward<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.139> there

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
there isn't continue downward if there

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.930 
there isn't continue downward if there
is<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:56.009> need<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.220> go<00:04:56.340> off<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.610> left<00:04:56.819> and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
is you need to go off to the left and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.550 
is you need to go off to the left and
right<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.120> figure<00:04:57.599> out<00:04:57.630> what<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.319> hell<00:04:58.440> you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
right and figure out what the hell you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.180 
right and figure out what the hell you
missed<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.660> there<00:05:01.259> we've<00:05:01.530> reached<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.919> level

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
missed so there we've reached the level

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.650 
missed so there we've reached the level
of<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.639> asset<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.300> see<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.569> we're

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
of the asset as you can see and we're

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.559 
of the asset as you can see and we're
gonna<00:05:03.750> make<00:05:03.930> our<00:05:04.050> way<00:05:04.080> over<00:05:04.530> here<00:05:04.800> -<00:05:05.569> the

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
gonna make our way over here - the

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:19.909 
gonna make our way over here - the
Metroid's<00:05:18.050> as<00:05:19.050> being<00:05:19.259> silent<00:05:19.590> on<00:05:19.650> purpose

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
Metroid's as being silent on purpose

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.930 
Metroid's as being silent on purpose
there<00:05:20.039> what<00:05:20.190> did<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.370> hear<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.610> little

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.870 
there what did you hear that little
beeping<00:05:21.419> sound<00:05:21.750> basically<00:05:22.560> each<00:05:23.039> area<00:05:23.639> has

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
beeping sound basically each area has

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.920 
beeping sound basically each area has
its<00:05:24.210> own<00:05:24.360> nifty<00:05:25.110> kind<00:05:25.409> of<00:05:25.590> level<00:05:26.370> music<00:05:26.930> and

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
its own nifty kind of level music and

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.779 
its own nifty kind of level music and
it's<00:05:28.050> more<00:05:28.229> of<00:05:28.319> an<00:05:28.409> incarnation<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:29.130> this<00:05:29.370> same

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
it's more of an incarnation of this same

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.480 
it's more of an incarnation of this same
theme<00:05:30.120> in<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:31.069> you<00:05:32.069> have<00:05:32.190> those<00:05:32.370> little

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
theme in that you have those little

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.070 
theme in that you have those little
beeping<00:05:32.909> booming<00:05:33.270> noises<00:05:35.659> this<00:05:36.659> looks<00:05:36.900> like<00:05:37.020> a

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
beeping booming noises this looks like a

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.659 
beeping booming noises this looks like a
familiar<00:05:37.560> room<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.009> in<00:05:38.159> it<00:05:38.310> we<00:05:38.460> have<00:05:38.639> a

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
Metroid haha crew - guest I think I

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.999 
Metroid haha crew - guest I think I
might<00:05:42.509> have<00:05:44.930> you're<00:05:45.930> on<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.080> roll<00:05:46.380> these

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
might have you're on a roll these

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:47.930 
might have you're on a roll these
Metroid's<00:05:47.370> aren't<00:05:47.550> gonna<00:05:47.639> know<00:05:47.699> what<00:05:47.759> hit

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
Metroid's aren't gonna know what hit

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.990 
Metroid's aren't gonna know what hit
them<00:05:49.070> one<00:05:50.070> person<00:05:50.370> pointed<00:05:50.699> out<00:05:50.789> something

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
them one person pointed out something

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.420 
them one person pointed out something
interesting<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.719> that<00:05:51.930> if<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.349> look<00:05:52.800> at<00:05:53.340> the

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
interesting in that if you look at the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.629 
interesting in that if you look at the
map<00:05:53.669> and<00:05:53.900> measure<00:05:54.900> it<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.199> scale<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:56.520> will

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
map and measure it to scale you will

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.610 
map and measure it to scale you will
find<00:05:56.849> that<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.150> entirety<00:05:57.659> of<00:05:57.870> this<00:05:58.139> area

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
find that the entirety of this area

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.310 
find that the entirety of this area
should<00:05:59.130> or<00:05:59.310> should<00:05:59.430> not<00:05:59.460> even<00:05:59.669> be<00:06:00.050> 2.5<00:06:01.050> square

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
should or should not even be 2.5 square

kilometers
I<00:06:03.220> find<00:06:04.220> it<00:06:04.370> incredibly<00:06:04.910> interesting<00:06:05.510> that

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
I find it incredibly interesting that

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.950 
I find it incredibly interesting that
the<00:06:06.350> entirety<00:06:06.740> of<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.010> Metroid<00:06:07.370> species

the entirety of the Metroid species

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.600 
the entirety of the Metroid species
exists<00:06:08.960> in<00:06:09.140> such<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.740> small<00:06:09.920> portion<00:06:10.400> of<00:06:10.460> their
