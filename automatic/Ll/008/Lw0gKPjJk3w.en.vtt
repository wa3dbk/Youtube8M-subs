stuff like waiting on Wednesdays and in

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.690 
stuff like waiting on Wednesdays and in
my<00:03:34.880> mailbox<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.510> book<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:37.040> fear<00:03:37.490> but

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
my mailbox in the book and I fear but

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.030 
my mailbox in the book and I fear but

memes on book blogging and book tubing
so<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.220> thought<00:03:43.460> that<00:03:43.520> was<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> really<00:03:43.820> fun<00:03:44.180> that

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
so I thought that was a really fun that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.020 
so I thought that was a really fun that
she<00:03:44.450> actually<00:03:45.100> incorporated<00:03:46.100> stuff<00:03:46.880> like

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
she actually incorporated stuff like

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.320 
she actually incorporated stuff like
that<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:47.510> know<00:03:47.630> if<00:03:47.720> Jennifer<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:49.330> book

that I don't know if Jennifer is a book

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.450 
that I don't know if Jennifer is a book
blogger<00:03:50.540> herself<00:03:51.050> or<00:03:51.260> how<00:03:52.040> she<00:03:52.100> got<00:03:52.310> all<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.190 
blogger herself or how she got all this
information<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.210> loved<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.810> was<00:03:53.990> one<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.140> my

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
information but I loved it was one of my

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.260 
information but I loved it was one of my
favorite<00:03:54.590> parts<00:03:54.860> immediately<00:03:55.760> intrigued<00:03:56.120> by

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
favorite parts immediately intrigued by

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.660 
favorite parts immediately intrigued by
it<00:03:56.300> I<00:03:56.600> felt<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.050> Haiti<00:03:57.290> was<00:03:57.530> an<00:03:57.770> incredibly

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
it I felt like Haiti was an incredibly

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.910 
it I felt like Haiti was an incredibly
realistic<00:03:59.300> main<00:03:59.840> character<00:04:00.260> as<00:04:00.410> well<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
realistic main character as well and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.070 
realistic main character as well and
that<00:04:01.490> really<00:04:01.670> drew<00:04:02.060> me<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.420> story<00:04:02.690> because

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
that really drew me to the story because

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.920 
that really drew me to the story because
I'm<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.320> big<00:04:03.740> character<00:04:03.980> person<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.510> really

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
I'm a big character person and I really

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.010 
I'm a big character person and I really
hate<00:04:06.650> when<00:04:07.070> books<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:08.000> really<00:04:08.720> really

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
hate when books have really really

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.440 
hate when books have really really
strong<00:04:09.430> female<00:04:10.430> characters<00:04:10.910> with<00:04:11.150> no

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
strong female characters with no

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.200 
strong female characters with no
vulnerable

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
vulnerable

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.210 
vulnerable
whatsoever<00:04:12.690> because<00:04:12.900> everybody<00:04:13.620> even<00:04:13.860> men

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
whatsoever because everybody even men

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.970 
whatsoever because everybody even men
and<00:04:14.580> strong<00:04:15.180> women<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:16.020> vulnerability<00:04:16.740> and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
and strong women have vulnerability and

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.980 
and strong women have vulnerability and
I<00:04:17.370> understand<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.240> a<00:04:18.330> good<00:04:18.480> role<00:04:18.690> model

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:18.990 
I understand that it's a good role model

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.890 
I understand that it's a good role model
to<00:04:19.020> have<00:04:19.440> strong<00:04:20.040> female<00:04:20.370> characters<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:21.540> i

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
to have strong female characters but i

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.770 
to have strong female characters but i
really<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.500> when<00:04:22.800> they<00:04:23.430> are<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> little<00:04:24.570> bit

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
really like when they are a little bit

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600 
really like when they are a little bit
more<00:04:24.870> realistic<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.680> can<00:04:25.950> be<00:04:26.070> very<00:04:26.280> strong

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
more realistic and can be very strong

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.980 
more realistic and can be very strong
but<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.090> also<00:04:27.180> be<00:04:27.390> very<00:04:27.570> weak<00:04:27.810> at<00:04:27.960> times

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
but can also be very weak at times

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.740 
but can also be very weak at times
because<00:04:28.440> that's<00:04:29.340> how<00:04:29.550> humans<00:04:29.940> really<00:04:30.330> are<00:04:30.450> and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
because that's how humans really are and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.790 
because that's how humans really are and
so<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.110> really<00:04:31.260> nice<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.500> see<00:04:31.770> that

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
so it's really nice to see that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.770 
so it's really nice to see that
incorporated<00:04:32.430> into<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.640> book<00:04:32.820> she<00:04:33.180> definitely

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
incorporated into a book she definitely

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.210 
incorporated into a book she definitely
didn't<00:04:34.140> let<00:04:34.290> people<00:04:34.560> walk<00:04:34.650> all<00:04:34.830> over<00:04:34.890> her

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
didn't let people walk all over her

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.430 
didn't let people walk all over her
though<00:04:35.430> she<00:04:36.060> wasn't<00:04:36.450> just<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.020> vulnerable

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
though she wasn't just the vulnerable

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.220 
though she wasn't just the vulnerable
she<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.740> also<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.490> very<00:04:39.090> realistically<00:04:39.840> strong

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
she was also a very realistically strong

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.370 
she was also a very realistically strong
and<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.710> like<00:04:41.610> outs<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.570> outside<00:04:43.020> she<00:04:43.230> was

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
and I like outs on the outside she was

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.720 
and I like outs on the outside she was
strong<00:04:43.560> but<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.980> inside<00:04:44.010> she<00:04:44.430> was<00:04:44.550> weak

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
strong but on the inside she was weak

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.880 
strong but on the inside she was weak
just<00:04:45.060> like<00:04:45.210> people<00:04:45.420> are<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.140> I<00:04:46.560> love<00:04:46.830> that

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
just like people are and I love that

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.040 
just like people are and I love that
about<00:04:47.070> her<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> think<00:04:47.670> that<00:04:48.030> she<00:04:48.180> was<00:04:48.300> funny<00:04:48.750> I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
about her I think that she was funny I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.040 
about her I think that she was funny I
loved<00:04:49.710> reading<00:04:50.070> her<00:04:50.370> commentary<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.360> I<00:04:51.840> think

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
loved reading her commentary and I think

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.870 
loved reading her commentary and I think
she<00:04:52.680> was<00:04:52.800> an<00:04:52.890> incredibly<00:04:53.220> awesome<00:04:53.520> main

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
she was an incredibly awesome main

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.840 
she was an incredibly awesome main
character<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.450> also<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.620> loved<00:04:55.860> Damon<00:04:56.160> he

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
like there might be a little bit of

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.840 
like there might be a little bit of
insta<00:05:39.960> romance<00:05:40.410> going<00:05:40.680> on<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:41.250> kind<00:05:41.640> of<00:05:41.700> goes

insta romance going on it kind of goes

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.670 
insta romance going on it kind of goes
away<00:05:42.060> really<00:05:42.420> quickly<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:42.900> it's<00:05:43.200> not<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.620> I

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
away really quickly so it's not and I

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.500 
away really quickly so it's not and I
really<00:05:43.950> have<00:05:44.100> a<00:05:44.130> problem<00:05:44.370> in<00:05:44.670> store<00:05:44.970> oh<00:05:45.060> man<00:05:45.270> so

really have a problem in store oh man so
it<00:05:46.170> was<00:05:46.380> nice<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:46.950> didn't<00:05:47.370> incorporate

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
it was nice that it didn't incorporate

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.130 
it was nice that it didn't incorporate
it<00:05:48.060> like<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.300> thought<00:05:48.450> it<00:05:48.510> was<00:05:48.660> going<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:49.020> at

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
it like I thought it was going to at

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.130 
it like I thought it was going to at
first<00:05:49.320> there<00:05:49.860> was<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.510> daemon<00:05:51.510> is<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.660> very<00:05:51.840> mean

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
first there was a daemon is a very mean

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.320 
first there was a daemon is a very mean
character<00:05:52.650> so<00:05:52.950> that<00:05:53.580> kind<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.880> parallels

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
character so that kind of parallels

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.270 
character so that kind of parallels
pilot<00:05:54.780> because<00:05:54.870> Edward<00:05:55.290> was<00:05:55.440> mean<00:05:55.650> its<00:05:55.770> first

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
pilot because Edward was mean its first

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.490 
pilot because Edward was mean its first
as<00:05:56.460> well<00:05:56.670> there's<00:05:57.510> a<00:05:57.630> couple<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.140> scenes<00:05:58.380> that

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
as well there's a couple of scenes that

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.310 
as well there's a couple of scenes that
happen<00:05:58.920> in<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.190> woods<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.870> at<00:06:00.870> first<00:06:01.080> I

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
happen in the woods and at first I

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.600 
happen in the woods and at first I
thought<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:01.770> was<00:06:01.920> going<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.220> be<00:06:02.310> way

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
thought that that was going to be way

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.820 
thought that that was going to be way
