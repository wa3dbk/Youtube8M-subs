00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
right off the bat you're going to notice

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.620 
right off the bat you're going to notice
a<00:00:25.830> little<00:00:26.400> different<00:00:26.760> design<00:00:27.029> feature<00:00:27.330> we've

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
a little different design feature we've

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.109 
a little different design feature we've
actually<00:00:27.869> put<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> volume<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.980> power<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually put the volume up power and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
actually put the volume up power and
volume<00:00:30.449> down<00:00:30.599> keys<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> back<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
volume down keys on the back and the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.310 
volume down keys on the back and the
reason<00:00:32.040> why<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.340> did<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.899> studied

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
reason why we did this is as we studied

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
reason why we did this is as we studied
how<00:00:34.469> people<00:00:34.860> interact<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.550> their<00:00:35.700> phone

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
how people interact it with their phone

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
how people interact it with their phone
and<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> device<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.920> notice<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> when

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
and use the device we notice that when

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970 
and use the device we notice that when
they<00:00:38.640> picked<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.350> most<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.770> their

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
they picked it up most of the time their

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
they picked it up most of the time their
finger<00:00:41.280> goes<00:00:41.430> right<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.239> key<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
finger goes right over that key so it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
finger goes right over that key so it
allows<00:00:43.440> us<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> eliminate<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.309> keys<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
allows us to eliminate the keys on the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.139 
allows us to eliminate the keys on the
side<00:00:45.320> make<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> phone<00:00:46.649> slimmer<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> just

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
side make the phone slimmer and just

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.549 
side make the phone slimmer and just
easier<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.050> makes<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> more

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
easier to use it makes it a more

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
easier to use it makes it a more
comfortable<00:00:49.860> device<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.520> hand<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> with

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
comfortable device in your hand so with

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.250 
comfortable device in your hand so with
that<00:00:52.649> being<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.780> notice<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that being on the back what we notice is

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
that being on the back what we notice is
now<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.860> can't<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.550> into<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> phone<00:00:57.059> because

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
now I can't get into the phone because

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
now I can't get into the phone because
there's<00:00:57.480> no<00:00:57.600> keys<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:57.989> side<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.590> we

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there's no keys on the side so we

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
there's no keys on the side so we
developed<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.699> feature<00:00:59.910> called<00:01:00.030> knock<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.719> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
developed a feature called knock on it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
developed a feature called knock on it's
simply<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> click<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.980> twice<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
simply going to click it twice and it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
simply going to click it twice and it's
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> fire<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:05.060> this<00:01:06.060> will

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
these going on at once and that's qslide

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.560 
these going on at once and that's qslide
that's<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.650> multitask<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:37.330> new

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
feature that we've added for the g2 is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.770 
feature that we've added for the g2 is
our<00:02:41.260> slide<00:02:41.710> aside<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.360> allows<00:02:43.450> us

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
our slide aside and what that allows us

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.440 
our slide aside and what that allows us
to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.230> take<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.220> nap<00:02:45.880> we're<00:02:46.120> going<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.300> take

to do is take a nap we're going to take
three<00:02:46.630> fingers<00:02:47.110> slide<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.400> left

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
three fingers slide it to the left

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.270 
three fingers slide it to the left
you'll<00:02:49.120> see<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.390> here<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.660> says<00:02:49.810> app<00:02:50.050> save<00:02:50.440> so

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you'll see up here it says app save so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.790 
you'll see up here it says app save so
we'll<00:02:51.400> open<00:02:51.610> up<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.720> three<00:02:53.050> apps<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.470> this

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
we'll open up to three apps like this

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.320 
we'll open up to three apps like this
and<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.870> any<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.050> our<00:02:56.170> apps<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.120> right

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
and it can be any of our apps so right

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.540 
and it can be any of our apps so right
now<00:02:58.360> i<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.630> three<00:02:58.900> apps<00:02:59.050> saved<00:02:59.380> slide<00:03:00.340> back

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
now i have three apps saved slide back

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.130 
now i have three apps saved slide back
across<00:03:00.850> here's<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.360> my<00:03:01.390> apps

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
across here's all my apps

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.370 
across here's all my apps
snaps<00:03:02.620> right<00:03:02.800> back<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.780> each<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.170> apps

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.440 
snaps right back in to each of the apps
and<00:03:05.740> again<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.550> does<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.180> quickly

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
and again it does that so quickly

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.449 
and again it does that so quickly
because<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.440> Snapdragon<00:03:09.069> 800<00:03:09.430> processor

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
because of that Snapdragon 800 processor

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.699 
because of that Snapdragon 800 processor
so<00:03:10.150> everything<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.380> device

stabilization and basically what that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.700 
stabilization and basically what that
means<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:22.170> as<00:04:22.410> my<00:04:22.830> hand<00:04:23.250> shakes<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.990> lens

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
means is that as my hand shakes the lens

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.080 
means is that as my hand shakes the lens
of<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.920> camera<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.310> actually<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.910> to

of the camera is actually going to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.970 
of the camera is actually going to

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
counteract that movement giving me a
