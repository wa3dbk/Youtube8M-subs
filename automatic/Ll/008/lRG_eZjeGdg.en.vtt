what's going on there and the cool part

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
what's going on there and the cool part
seems<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.059> providing<00:00:51.570> most<00:00:51.780> of

seems to be the one providing most of
the<00:00:52.140> drive<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.239> why<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.840> constantly

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the drive so that's why it's constantly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.039 
the drive so that's why it's constantly

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.450 

that<00:01:04.049> cooler<00:01:04.350> part<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.010> doing<00:01:05.369> all

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that cooler part is the one doing all

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
that cooler part is the one doing all
the<00:01:05.519> bushing<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> hot<00:01:07.409> box<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.950> pushing

the bushing in the hot box just pushing
hot<00:01:08.369> water<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> only<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.430> gonna<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.760> back<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
hot water so only I'm gonna go back to

and<00:03:17.379> different<00:03:17.560> successes<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:20.970> certainly

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
and different successes I certainly

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.190 
and different successes I certainly
learned<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.269> lot<00:03:22.360> about<00:03:22.480> getting<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:22.959> one

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
learned a lot about getting this one

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:38.839 
learned a lot about getting this one
wrong

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.940 

looks<00:03:39.689> like<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.319> good<00:03:40.590> enough<00:03:40.650> now

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
looks like it so that's good enough now

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.640 
looks like it so that's good enough now
to<00:03:41.069> get<00:03:41.249> out<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.579> corner<00:03:41.849> now<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.650> wouldn't

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
to get out of that corner now I wouldn't

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.119 
to get out of that corner now I wouldn't
do<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.799> on<00:03:44.069> one<00:03:44.249> channel<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:46.799> just<00:03:46.980> get

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
do that on one channel you just get

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.569 
do that on one channel you just get
stuck<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> surface<00:03:50.159> tension

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
stuck there be the surface tension

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.309 
stuck there be the surface tension

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:54.749 
edge of the bar when you foil it just

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:55.940 
edge of the bar when you foil it just
stick<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.079> water<00:03:55.109> droplets<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:55.799> never

stick with the water droplets they never

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.140 
stick with the water droplets they never
get<00:03:56.129> stuck<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.900> now<00:03:58.760> exactly<00:03:59.760> what

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
get stuck like it is now exactly what
