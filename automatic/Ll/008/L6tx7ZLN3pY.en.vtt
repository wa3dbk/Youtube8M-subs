he's got a great long shot on him I
think<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.320> only<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> 70s<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.610> seems

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.550

like<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> 90s<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:18.900> every<00:02:19.260> time<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
to be a center attacking mid but he's

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.560

lee and really was right footed and he
does<00:03:11.280> at<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.610> flat<00:03:11.880> rate<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.690> also<00:03:12.840> have

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
they'll actually be able to finish it

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.320 
they'll actually be able to finish it
they<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.890> potential<00:03:23.280> volonino's<00:03:23.970> long

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
they see the potential volonino's long
shot<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.750> really<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.200> pretty<00:03:25.470> decent<00:03:25.800> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
shot it really is pretty decent and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.200 
shot it really is pretty decent and
moving<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.680> defense<00:03:29.190> their<00:03:29.970> full

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
moving on to the defense their full

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.300 
moving on to the defense their full
baths<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.690> pretty<00:03:30.900> good<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.770> center<00:03:32.130> that's

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
baths are pretty good the center that's

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.660 
baths are pretty good the center that's
not<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.880> good<00:03:33.080> at<00:03:34.080> left-back<00:03:34.530> we've<00:03:34.830> got<00:03:35.070> one<00:03:35.430> I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
not so good at left-back we've got one I

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.120 
not so good at left-back we've got one I
think<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.780> picked<00:03:37.020> him<00:03:37.110> up<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.470> about<00:03:37.680> seven

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
think I picked him up for about seven

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.180 
think I picked him up for about seven
hundred<00:03:38.160> coins<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.350> he's<00:03:40.350> pretty<00:03:40.680> good<00:03:40.980> I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
hundred coins and he's pretty good I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.550 
hundred coins and he's pretty good I
think<00:03:41.280> he's<00:03:41.790> three<00:03:42.120> star<00:03:42.480> he's<00:03:42.990> got<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
think he's three star he's got in the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.320 
think he's three star he's got in the
seventies<00:03:44.010> long<00:03:44.250> shots<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.790> he's<00:03:44.970> pretty

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
seventies long shots and he's pretty

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.360 
seventies long shots and he's pretty
quick<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.840> he's<00:03:45.990> also<00:03:46.200> got<00:03:46.470> decent<00:03:46.680> defensive

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
quick and he's also got decent defensive

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.310 
quick and he's also got decent defensive
stats<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.850> well<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.930> good<00:03:49.080> play<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
stats as well so it's a good play to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.860 
stats as well so it's a good play to
have<00:03:49.590> their<00:03:49.890> at<00:03:50.640> right-back<00:03:51.030> I've<00:03:51.420> gone<00:03:51.600> for

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
have their at right-back I've gone for

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.560

Leo<00:03:52.800> more<00:03:53.130> oh<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.460> think<00:03:53.580> I've<00:03:53.790> got<00:03:53.940> for<00:03:54.120> 2k<00:03:54.540> or

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
Leo more oh I think I've got for 2k or

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.020 
Leo more oh I think I've got for 2k or
1.5<00:03:55.290> k<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.860> right<00:03:56.070> wing<00:03:56.250> back<00:03:56.490> position

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
1.5 k in the right wing back position

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
1.5 k in the right wing back position
and<00:03:57.210> he's<00:03:57.720> got<00:03:57.960> 80<00:03:58.500> long<00:03:58.950> shots<00:03:59.220> i<00:03:59.370> think<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.670> is

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
and he's got 80 long shots i think it is

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.350 
and he's got 80 long shots i think it is
again<00:04:01.050> three<00:04:01.350> style<00:04:01.620> skill<00:04:01.920> moves<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.430> good

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
again three style skill moves and good

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.140 
again three style skill moves and good
pace<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.930> defensive<00:04:04.440> stats<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.820> could

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
pace and defensive stats so you could

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.920 
pace and defensive stats so you could
even<00:04:06.270> play<00:04:06.660> them<00:04:06.870> right<00:04:07.590> mid<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.240> left<00:04:09.240> mid<00:04:09.450> do

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
even play them right mid and left mid do

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.880 
even play them right mid and left mid do
to<00:04:10.140> them<00:04:10.440> having<00:04:10.950> great<00:04:11.340> attacking<00:04:11.730> stats<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
to them having great attacking stats the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.780 
to them having great attacking stats the
two<00:04:14.070> center<00:04:14.460> backs<00:04:14.490> are<00:04:15.290> all<00:04:16.290> right<00:04:16.830> their

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
two center backs are all right their

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.890 
two center backs are all right their
defensive<00:04:18.359> stats<00:04:18.600> aren't<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.170> great<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.950> a

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
defensive stats aren't that great but a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.230 
defensive stats aren't that great but a
rodolfo<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.530> that's<00:04:22.710> how<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:22.919> say<00:04:23.240> he's

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
rodolfo think that's how you say he's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.870 
rodolfo think that's how you say he's
got<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.110> sixties<00:04:25.620> long<00:04:25.830> shots<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.280> all<00:04:26.669> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
got in the sixties long shots of all the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.540 
got in the sixties long shots of all the
70s

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
70s

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.779 
70s
low<00:04:27.669> 70s<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.479> egg<00:04:29.289> carlos<00:04:29.770> also<00:04:30.250> has<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.580> same

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
low 70s and egg carlos also has the same

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.920 
low 70s and egg carlos also has the same
i<00:04:30.819> think<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.900> carlos<00:04:32.830> has<00:04:33.009> 70<00:04:33.610> pace<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.750> it's

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
i think but a carlos has 70 pace so it's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.990 
i think but a carlos has 70 pace so it's
not<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.199> great<00:04:35.620> but<00:04:35.889> they<00:04:36.310> make<00:04:36.580> suffers

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
not that great but they make suffers

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.659 
not that great but they make suffers
with<00:04:37.569> his<00:04:37.750> defending<00:04:38.259> and<00:04:38.379> heading<00:04:38.680> Rodolfo's

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
with his defending and heading Rodolfo's

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.029 
with his defending and heading Rodolfo's
not<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.120> great<00:04:40.419> center<00:04:41.050> back<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.259> have<00:04:41.560> their<00:04:41.860> I

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
not a great center back to have their I

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.010 
not a great center back to have their I
any<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.580> them<00:04:42.729> because<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.090> his<00:04:43.210> long<00:04:43.449> shots<00:04:43.750> as

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
any of them because of his long shots as

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.189 
any of them because of his long shots as
he<00:04:44.979> did<00:04:45.190> hit<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.400> post<00:04:45.699> from<00:04:46.000> about<00:04:46.539> 50<00:04:47.020> yards

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
he did hit the post from about 50 yards

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.499 
he did hit the post from about 50 yards
out<00:04:47.530> although<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.490> wasn't<00:04:48.699> recording<00:04:49.210> at<00:04:49.330> that

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
out although I wasn't recording at that

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.290 
out although I wasn't recording at that
time<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.620> they're<00:04:51.370> decent<00:04:51.789> players<00:04:52.000> if<00:04:52.180> you

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
time so they're decent players if you

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.140 
time so they're decent players if you
wanna<00:04:52.479> score<00:04:52.810> good<00:04:53.080> goals<00:04:53.349> with<00:04:53.530> them<00:04:54.150> finally

wanna score good goals with them finally
Ingo<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:55.750> have<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.289> runner<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.150> he's<00:04:58.150> really

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
Ingo I have a runner and he's really

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.629 
Ingo I have a runner and he's really
surprising<00:04:59.319> how<00:04:59.530> good<00:04:59.770> he<00:04:59.860> actually<00:05:00.069> is<00:05:00.400> I

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
surprising how good he actually is I

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.409 
surprising how good he actually is I
mean<00:05:01.349> he's<00:05:02.349> got<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.979> 80s<00:05:03.370> reflexes<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.210> in

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
mean he's got in the 80s reflexes and in

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.540 
mean he's got in the 80s reflexes and in
the<00:05:04.629> high<00:05:04.840> 70s<00:05:05.349> diving<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:05.889> think<00:05:06.219> that<00:05:06.400> is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the high 70s diving I think that is

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.110 
the high 70s diving I think that is
right<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.199> he's<00:05:08.310> generally<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> really<00:05:09.909> really

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
right and he's generally a really really

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.020 
right and he's generally a really really
good<00:05:10.449> keeper<00:05:10.960> he<00:05:11.889> just<00:05:12.099> pulls<00:05:12.370> up<00:05:12.550> top<00:05:12.789> class

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
good keeper he just pulls up top class

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.839 
good keeper he just pulls up top class
saves<00:05:13.389> he<00:05:13.840> saves<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:14.349> lot<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.639> headers<00:05:15.639> and

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
saves he saves a lot of headers and

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.430 
saves he saves a lot of headers and
stuff<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:16.990> when<00:05:17.139> you're<00:05:17.289> playing

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
stuff like that so when you're playing

think<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.430> picked<00:05:48.669> up<00:05:48.819> reinaldo<00:05:49.419> for<00:05:49.719> about<00:05:50.050> a

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
think I picked up reinaldo for about a

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.439

thousand<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:50.770> do<00:05:50.979> go<00:05:51.310> for<00:05:51.969> like<00:05:52.120> four<00:05:52.389> hundred

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
thousand and do go for like four hundred

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.320 
thousand and do go for like four hundred
coins<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.800> they're<00:05:53.979> good<00:05:54.190> players<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.729> it's<00:05:55.240> a

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
coins so they're good players and it's a
