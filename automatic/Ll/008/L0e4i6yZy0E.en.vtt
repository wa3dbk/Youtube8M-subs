00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:07.300
 with this i would like to show 3d here 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.310
 origami pieces can fold 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.280
 use printing paper yourself 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.110
 craft all kinds of different colors 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.600
 tool used is just where the advantage 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.600
 use here because of this 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.550
 A4 paper here you can do a total of 32 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.210
 pieces I have lived Expand 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.210
 buddies 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 you end up getting to is three 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.570
 to go once 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 the idea is that you get it quickly 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.320
 bon double things and fold 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.820
 several see me stanley girls 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.890
 use then cut 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 I even saw someone once 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.580
 kills a knife too much used i am you 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.760
 safe and ship and this just yet 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.510
 easy so it is just what you yourself 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 this is a can 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 also want 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.630
 again 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.260
 as happens here now that there is a small one 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.170
 piece closed off not torn 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.550
 that doesn't matter 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.400
 eventually if you go the pieces 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.010
 marry you don't see that when you get half 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 tear off the leaf it wouldn't 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.990
 because I think you should 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.910
 ultimately, it is cut off your 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.910
 it could leave so you know 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.260
 this is and they are buddy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.910
 he is going to work well, the idea is 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.910
 that you fold a double 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.920
 wrong note 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.220
 so you open it again it is a 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.220
 line 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 attack the right thing 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.290
 proud of it 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.629
 running well 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.420
 you go these two figurines you go to 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.599
 inside you go a kind of diamond shape 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.599
 to make 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 nature 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.440
 search for it is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.469
 would you have a good day 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.120
 that is one 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120
 it is the origami tropez 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.980
 not once 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.040
 so this is a piece 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.950
 piece out 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610
 Oh 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.980
 from 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.120
 you will see a lot of videos 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.220
 this is completely flat and very much 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.919
 movies you can see that there is a space in the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.840
 bits it created this on your 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.690
 pieces of yarn have them together find it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.330
 also nice that energy a few 100 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.610
 pieces need that if you ten 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:43.030
 and keep them as a gift and then 10 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:51.580
 make pieces out of 10 and then you have 100 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:54.120
 pieces and so he would cross each other 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 easier in 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.509
 save years 3d origami 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.099
 I hope it will help you 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.099
 because you yourself also a tipping point
