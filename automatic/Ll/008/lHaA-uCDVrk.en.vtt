once I used it as a revolving spray
table<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:41.379> feel<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.709> standing<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.639> one<00:02:43.849> place

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
table I feel that standing in one place

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.739 
table I feel that standing in one place
and<00:02:44.480> spring<00:02:45.019> while<00:02:45.950> turning<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.489> table<00:02:46.879> gives

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:47.749 
and spring while turning the table gives

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.800 
and spring while turning the table gives
a<00:02:47.989> more<00:02:48.200> even<00:02:48.709> finish

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
a more even finish

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.280 
a more even finish
one<00:02:51.620> final<00:02:51.920> note<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:53.360> back<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> copper

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
one final note going back to the copper

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.940 
one final note going back to the copper
wire<00:02:54.530> spirals<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:56.290> feel<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> little<00:02:57.590> uneasy

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
wire spirals I feel a little uneasy

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.880 
wire spirals I feel a little uneasy
about<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.970> outer<00:02:59.300> ring<00:02:59.780> loosening<00:03:00.650> up

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.339 

to<00:03:03.890> solve<00:03:04.159> the<00:03:04.310> problem<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:05.180> using<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:06.019> spring

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
to solve the problem I'm using a spring

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.699 
to solve the problem I'm using a spring
clamp<00:03:06.620> in<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.790> drop<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.420> superglue<00:03:11.680> when<00:03:12.680> I

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
clamp in and drop the superglue when I

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.059 
clamp in and drop the superglue when I
am<00:03:12.950> satisfied<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.909> it<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.150> holding<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:15.680> I

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
am satisfied that it is holding then I

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.789 
am satisfied that it is holding then I
will<00:03:16.489> spray<00:03:16.819> both<00:03:17.090> sides<00:03:17.390> was<00:03:17.989> either<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.379> clear

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
will spray both sides was either a clear

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.230 
will spray both sides was either a clear
lacquer<00:03:19.040> or<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.659> aerosol
