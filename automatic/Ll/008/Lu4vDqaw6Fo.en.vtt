you can eliminate the step of having to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
you can eliminate the step of having to
use<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.170> threading<00:01:40.680> needle<00:01:40.980> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.460> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
actually use the prepared end of the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
actually use the prepared end of the
fluorocarbon<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.630> insert<00:01:45.990> into<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> braid

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and the motion you want to use is you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.220 
and the motion you want to use is you
actually<00:01:56.910> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> resist<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.690> temptation

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
actually want to resist the temptation

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
has a tendency to do this so the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.820 
has a tendency to do this so the
movement<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.010> actually<00:02:05.190> two<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:07.470> motion

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.170 
movement is actually two and the motion
you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.520> want<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> hold<00:02:08.970> the

recommend that you put the fluorocarbon
into<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> braid<00:02:41.280> 5<00:02:41.550> feet<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.250> we've

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
into the braid 5 feet so that's we've

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.309 
into the braid 5 feet so that's we've
quickly<00:02:44.819> achieved<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.900> about<00:02:46.080> 5<00:02:46.350> feet

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
way and start the server off slowly to

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.030 
way and start the server off slowly to
make<00:03:45.099> sure<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.370> lines<00:03:45.580> coming<00:03:45.910> out<00:03:46.090> evenly

then<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:49.959> go<00:03:50.080> ahead<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.410> just<00:03:50.590> spin<00:03:50.860> the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
then you can go ahead and just spin the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:06.000 
then you can go ahead and just spin the
circle

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
we're gonna spin right over that so it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.890 
we're gonna spin right over that so it
locks<00:05:14.169> it<00:05:14.379> in<00:05:15.300> we're<00:05:16.300> gonna<00:05:16.419> go<00:05:16.629> another

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
using and I cut this grooving with the

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.439 
using and I cut this grooving with the
pipe<00:05:59.590> cutter<00:05:59.889> sort<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.760> has<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:00.910> tapered

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
pipe cutter sort it has a tapered

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.570 
pipe cutter sort it has a tapered
channel<00:06:01.990> in<00:06:02.110> yet<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.919> locks<00:06:03.250> into<00:06:03.490> the

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580

channel in yet and it locks into the
thread<00:06:03.940> very<00:06:04.120> quickly<00:06:05.190> can<00:06:06.190> apply<00:06:06.460> some<00:06:06.760> glue

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
thread very quickly can apply some glue

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.600 
thread very quickly can apply some glue
in<00:06:08.020> this<00:06:08.320> area<00:06:08.680> where<00:06:08.919> we<00:06:09.100> finished<00:06:09.460> our
