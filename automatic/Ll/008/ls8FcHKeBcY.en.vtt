00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.530
 to many people who would give anything to increase their metabolism 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.010
 since once this is accomplished it allows you to burn fat quickly and 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.659
 lose weight with minimal effort 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.659
 the metabolism refers to the frequency in which the body produces x 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.199
 consumes energy and calories 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.640
 There are several factors that affect a person's metabolism 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.249
 such as the amount of muscle tissue 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.149
 the frequency with which food is consumed 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.449
 genetic issues digestive system stress levels 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.650
 personal diet 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.390
 and the activity levels that we have 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.550
 then 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.130
 teachers what are the ways in which this can increase their 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.260
 metabolism 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 one 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.920
 breakfast 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.130
 many people ignore the fact that breakfast is the most important meal 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.470
 of the day 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.730
 Even if it seems strange to you, people who eat breakfast are thinner than 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.220
 those that do not 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.620
 the metabolism may slow down if breakfast was taken midmorning 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 or if you wait until noon to eat something 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.260
 avoid sugar 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.550
 sugar allows the body to store fat 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 It is recommended that a person consume foods that help maintain a level 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 normal blood sugar 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.570
 I also exercise two or three times a week 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 to have stable blood sugar level 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.330
 consume spicy dishes 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.840
 these spicy dishes help increase the metabolism 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.430
 sleep more 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.620
 According to the research, people who do not get enough sleep 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.860
 are more likely to gain weight 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 also the muscles regenerate during this time of inactivity 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.220
 where more water 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 Water 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 discards toxins from the body 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.159
 that occur every time the body 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.610
 fat burning 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.660
 most body functions require water and lack of water in 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.540
 the organism 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.640
 makes it lower its speed in the functions and the tan occurs 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 undesirable stress as a result 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.499
 detoxify the digestive system 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.209
 a clean and healthy digestive system 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.219
 not only helps the body operate more efficiently 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.549
 it also gives you energy 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.919
 besides that they had a clean digestive system we can take advantage 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:26.009
 better the nutrients of the food 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.029
 a program that recommend the theme 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.909
 is that of Dr. Susan 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.209
 which you can find on your right 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.699
 7 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.199
 eat more little 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.409
 It is recommended to consume four to six small meals during the day 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.479
 letting two to three hours pass between each 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.979
 never skip meals 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:51.260
 people tend to skip meals with hope and lose weight 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.709
 which is a big mistake 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.169
 since this makes the metabolism a little slower 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.869
 meal plans in detail 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.349
 always prepare the exact amount of food that will consume 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.489
 get rid of stress 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.869
 be it physical we can unal 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.330
 this one has to release a steroid called cortisol 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.299
 which affects the metabolism 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.819
 It is also proven that people eat more as they are 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.609
 stressed 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.849
 with its more than obvious 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.339
 can be used as a substitute for coffee 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.540
 green tea has the ability to stimulate the metabolism 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.019
 and unlike coffee 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.709
 has no side effects as it is frequently taken during the day 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.369
 includes more meals than energy in your diet 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.769
 such as vegetable fruits 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.819
 beans and whole foods 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.879
 Obtaining the desired body 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.019
 it is not impossible if you have the determination and patience necessary 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.829
 to stabilize our metabolism 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.969
 which played a very important role in weight loss 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.149
 people need to realize 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.419
 what to eat well and exercise 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.870
 It is a lifestyle 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.449
 and not a luxury 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.969
 resisting cravings is very difficult for many of us 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.820
 something very helpful and I recommend again 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.650
 that program the author to his second points 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.340
 which can contract their right hand 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.909
 I recommend you visit his site 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.719
 For my part it is all I hope that what this money was waiting for them 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.750
 see you next have good morning good afternoon 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.270
 Goodnight
