it's<00:00:02.340> fantastic<00:00:02.850> it's<00:00:03.449> phenomenal<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:04.830> at

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
it's fantastic it's phenomenal look at

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.789 
it's fantastic it's phenomenal look at
this<00:00:05.160> first<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.210> all<00:00:06.330> do<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.350> need<00:00:07.560> any

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
this first of all do you need any

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.310 
this first of all do you need any
convincing<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.519> your<00:00:09.150> eye<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.480> actually<00:00:09.990> an

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
convincing that your eye is actually an

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.669 
convincing that your eye is actually an
extension<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.950> brain<00:00:11.190> tissue<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:12.019> mean<00:00:13.019> doesn't

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
extension of brain tissue I mean doesn't

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.499 
extension of brain tissue I mean doesn't
it<00:00:13.860> look<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.730> little<00:00:15.120> brain<00:00:15.330> with

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it look like it's a little brain with

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.599 
it look like it's a little brain with
eyeballs<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.109> it

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
eyeballs on it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.750 
eyeballs on it
that<00:00:17.609> would<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> really<00:00:18.180> cool<00:00:18.300> dissection

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
that would be a really cool dissection

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560 
that would be a really cool dissection
so<00:00:21.410> light<00:00:22.410> information<00:00:23.570> stimulates

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
so light information stimulates

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.529 
so light information stimulates
receptors<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> retina<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.880> through<00:00:27.420> the

magic of all five layers of retina cells

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.530 
magic of all five layers of retina cells
are<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.510> send<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.290> message<00:00:34.440> through

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
are going to send the message through

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.590 
are going to send the message through
cranial<00:00:36.540> nerve<00:00:36.750> number<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> optic<00:00:39.390> nerve

cranial nerve number two the optic nerve

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.959 
cranial nerve number two the optic nerve
now<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.370> sorts<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.480> cool<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
now there's all sorts of really cool and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.209 
now there's all sorts of really cool and
fascinating<00:00:45.110> physiological<00:00:46.219> consequences

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
fascinating physiological consequences

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.240 
fascinating physiological consequences
of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> fact<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.890> optic<00:00:49.890> nerves

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of the fact that the optic nerves

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.750 
of the fact that the optic nerves
actually<00:00:51.210> cross<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> optic<00:00:52.829> chiasm<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually cross at the optic chiasm and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.139 
actually cross at the optic chiasm and
you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.440> information<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you can see that information from the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
you can see that information from the
right<00:00:57.989> side<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
right side I don't know is that the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.080 
right side I don't know is that the
Becca's<00:01:00.449> writers<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> left<00:01:01.670> whatever<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
Becca's writers that is left whatever I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.670 
Becca's writers that is left whatever I
think<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.379> says<00:01:04.619> left<00:01:04.890> am<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.189> correct

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
think that says left am I correct

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
think that says left am I correct
whatever<00:01:08.450> really<00:01:09.450> whatever<00:01:10.369> keep<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:12.530> okay

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
whatever really whatever keep going okay

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.330 
whatever really whatever keep going okay
that<00:01:14.430> those<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.420> information<00:01:16.040> splits<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that those that information splits and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.820 
that those that information splits and
goes<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> both<00:01:18.060> sides<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> brain<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.650> does

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
goes to both sides of the brain so does

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
goes to both sides of the brain so does
the<00:01:19.950> information<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:20.880> eye<00:01:21.240> ball

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the information from the other eye ball

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
the information from the other eye ball
it<00:01:21.810> goes<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.140> both<00:01:22.320> sides<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> brain<00:01:23.009> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it goes to both sides of the brain so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
it goes to both sides of the brain so
you<00:01:23.640> actually<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.780> place<00:01:25.470> where<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.159> are

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you actually have a place where you are

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
you actually have a place where you are
receiving<00:01:27.090> by<00:01:28.020> knock<00:01:28.290> Euler<00:01:29.360> vision<00:01:30.560> both<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
your eyes and that sight information is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.890 
your eyes and that sight information is
being<00:01:35.189> processed<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.909> both<00:01:36.210> sides<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> your

brain where are you going to expect it
to<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> such<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> lovely<00:01:44.070> image

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
to go this is a such a lovely image

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
to go this is a such a lovely image
because<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> stop

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
because you're going to have a stop

where<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.689> superior<00:02:32.790> colliculus<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
where to the superior colliculus this is

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.940 
where to the superior colliculus this is
different<00:02:36.519> than<00:02:36.969> the<00:02:37.030> ear<00:02:37.620> remember<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.739> that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
different than the ear remember in that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.160 
different than the ear remember in that
pathway<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.730> went<00:02:39.969> to<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.359> inferior

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
pathway we went to the inferior

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.069 
pathway we went to the inferior
colliculus<00:02:41.799> first<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:43.329> we<00:02:43.569> went<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
colliculus first and then we went to the

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.869 
colliculus first and then we went to the
thalamus<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:45.189> is<00:02:45.370> different

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
thalamus this is different

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.089 
thalamus this is different
this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.359> worse<00:02:47.019> dividing<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:47.950> conquering

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
this is worse dividing and conquering

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.759 
this is worse dividing and conquering
let's<00:02:48.730> send<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.209> information<00:02:50.019> both<00:02:50.319> places

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
let's send that information both places

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.429 
let's send that information both places
at<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.069> same<00:02:51.340> time<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:52.629> thalamus<00:02:52.959> will

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
at the same time the thalamus will

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.129 
at the same time the thalamus will
decide<00:02:53.799> should<00:02:54.430> we<00:02:54.609> make<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:55.060> conscious<00:02:55.989> or

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
decide should we make this conscious or

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.740 
decide should we make this conscious or
not<00:02:56.169> the<00:02:56.980> superior<00:02:57.579> colliculus<00:02:58.239> will<00:02:58.510> pay

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
not the superior colliculus will pay

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.920 
not the superior colliculus will pay
attention<00:02:59.040> for<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.430> spider<00:03:00.969> dropping<00:03:01.419> out<00:03:01.629> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
attention for the spider dropping out of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.530 
attention for the spider dropping out of
the<00:03:02.019> ceiling<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.060> scaring<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.090> crap<00:03:04.269> out<00:03:04.480> of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the ceiling and scaring the crap out of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.270 
the ceiling and scaring the crap out of
you<00:03:06.480> from<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.569> superior<00:03:08.019> colliculus<00:03:08.590> if<00:03:08.859> it

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
you from the superior colliculus if it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.690 
you from the superior colliculus if it
is<00:03:09.400> activated<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.349> reflex<00:03:11.799> occurs<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
is activated then the reflex occurs and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.699 
is activated then the reflex occurs and
all<00:03:12.909> that<00:03:13.150> motor<00:03:13.419> stuff<00:03:13.840> happens<00:03:14.260> there<00:03:14.650> are

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
all that motor stuff happens there are

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.729 
all that motor stuff happens there are
no<00:03:15.040> motor<00:03:15.310> pathways<00:03:15.939> on<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.840> image<00:03:17.530> right

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
no motor pathways on this image right

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.099 
no motor pathways on this image right
now<00:03:17.849> so<00:03:18.849> who<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.690> mean

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
now so who I mean

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.990 
now so who I mean
from<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.440> thalamus<00:03:20.650> there<00:03:21.129> could<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.340> motor

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
from the thalamus there could be motor

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000 
from the thalamus there could be motor
things<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.659> are<00:03:22.780> happening<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:23.829> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
things that are happening but if the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.869 
things that are happening but if the
thalamus<00:03:24.430> decides<00:03:25.079> worthy<00:03:26.079> let's<00:03:26.979> send<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.669> to

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
thalamus decides worthy let's send it to

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.159 
thalamus decides worthy let's send it to
the<00:03:28.000> occipital<00:03:28.449> lobe<00:03:29.430> back<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.879> where<00:03:31.750> okay

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
the occipital lobe back here where okay

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.020 
the occipital lobe back here where okay
let's<00:03:32.829> let's<00:03:33.189> think<00:03:33.430> about<00:03:33.609> what<00:03:33.879> we're

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
let's let's think about what we're

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.819 
let's let's think about what we're
seeing<00:03:34.269> let's<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:34.989> about<00:03:35.109> how<00:03:35.229> great<00:03:35.650> this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
seeing let's think about how great this

whatever<00:03:41.879> is<00:03:42.879> there<00:03:43.030> anything<00:03:43.150> else<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.509> need

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
whatever is there anything else you need

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.229 
whatever is there anything else you need
to<00:03:43.750> know<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.639> don't<00:03:45.639> think<00:03:45.759> so

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
to know I don't think so

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.420 
to know I don't think so
does<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.959> fill<00:03:47.259> in<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> whole<00:03:48.009> bunch<00:03:48.310> of

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
does that fill in a whole bunch of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.670 
does that fill in a whole bunch of
really<00:03:48.759> interesting<00:03:49.209> blanks<00:03:50.079> for<00:03:50.259> you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
really interesting blanks for you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.439 
really interesting blanks for you
it<00:03:51.400> totally<00:03:51.729> does<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.299> me<00:03:53.159> all<00:03:54.159> right<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.759> that

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
it totally does for me all right so that

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.270 
it totally does for me all right so that
is<00:03:55.810> uh<00:03:56.849> we're<00:03:57.849> done<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.329> now<00:03:59.199> you<00:03:59.859> can<00:04:00.129> get

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
is uh we're done and now you can get

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.460 
is uh we're done and now you can get
really<00:04:00.609> excited<00:04:01.030> about<00:04:01.150> doing<00:04:01.569> mapping

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
