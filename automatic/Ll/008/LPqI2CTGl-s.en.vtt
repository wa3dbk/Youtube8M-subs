00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.580
 we are back with amazon sat education 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.670
 and in this second block we will show 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.980
 some products of the technologies project 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.980
 social and agroecological fucking 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.900
 the maylson he agronomist is also part 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.180
 this research with yams in this you 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.610
 this project responsible for folder 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.200
 fertilization exactly we are 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.110
 developing a few experiences 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.309
 here in the municipality of caapiranga 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 together with doctors that we 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 calls for participatory research because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 traditionally the cultivation of ace it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.560
 is made in the cutting and burning system of the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.070
 forest as a character uses that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.050
 area or one or two years later 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 goes with a new area, right? 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.960
 and this area that was used 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.450
 previously she is at rest in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.160
 fallow rest after it returns to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.440
 idea of ​​the project is what people 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.600
 re-use these poultry which 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.880
 have already been used that from the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
 second year of production 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 we think it decreases 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 is due to the extraction of nutrients 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.930
 by plants life research 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.060
 sun and rain and here we are doing 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.830
 a job that is in the sense that people 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.450
 improve soil quality 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.460
 So you 're doing a job with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 fertilization see any team uses 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 legumes in the car uses beans 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 cowboy 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.820
 what we saw here because it's a 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.890
 culture that is also cultivated in the region 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 which serves as a source of food for 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 they serve as fertilizer for the soil or 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 with it provides hydrogen element 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.979
 essential also everything 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.200
 the plants and will focus on 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.019
 after that bean and it is harvested 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.470
 this bean it is cut and incorporated 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.360
 to the green mass a soil and also it forms 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.829
 a layer of soil protection leaving 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 the soil that is dried and avoided is that soil 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.510
 dry hard to 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.069
 development 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.310
 this can be considered a 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.010
 alternative way for farmers not to 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.900
 burn the soil as it is a result of 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.579
 research that will not indicate this, right? 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.110
 This is a technology that we're going to 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.140
 use and enjoy the areas because 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 we use green manure what we people 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 hopes to conquer the project is what 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.829
 this fertilizer and it goes back and forth is to return 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 soil nutrients will not cover this 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.579
 soil with organic matter will know 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.530
 a nutrient then it can reuse 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.040
 that the next planting 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.599
 here we use an unbroken spacing 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.030
 throw in cups here one is always 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.389
 more or less in the midst of these 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.000
 opens a boring spice juice with the 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.900
 hoe where the seed of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.459
 cowpea beans 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.459
 after made and a half 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.019
 these singers are covered are closed 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.389
 closed 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.000
 This bean here with 156 days goes 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.430
 finish 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.569
 and then at 35 days 45 days he is already 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.239
 harvesting beans 11 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.859
 is a low-cost technology because 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.840
 it can also store seeds from a 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.400
 year to year 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.400
 is a low-cost technology that he 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 has natural fertilizer improving the sun with 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.459
 organic matter 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.400
 there will be need causing fertilizer 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.699
 reduce production costs to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.230
 he is the source of food and also of the earth 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.239
 was the marketing of seeds for 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.160
 bean producers is already the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.370
 executive producers cowpea 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.669
 did not know this new technique is 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.069
 did not use the blow is incorporating touch the 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.260
 iso cowpea and consortium with other 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.819
 cultures like cassava cassava 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.220
 and we are implementing this together 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.569
 You're welcome, I'm here too. 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.209
 that this cock is with these 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.069
 Highlights are tutors heard that he 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.780
 facilitates channel development 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.099
 because it is a plant that needs a lot of 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.620
 solar energy 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.500
 so when you put cited the plant 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.450
 grow here and see in hama 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.570
 this also favors better 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.150
 and the advantage here is also 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.850
 is that you get easier to handle the 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.130
 culture today by the following what 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.410
 It happens if you did not have tuttle holding 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.200
 the plant as it is that harms the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.090
 face does not harm the guy that client 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.160
 heading will form a right carpet 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.420
 Only here you won 70 when you 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.910
 has the advantage of the plant develops 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.530
 the quicker you reduce the risk of 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.180
 disease because the plant will not have 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.740
 contact with soil 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.450
 in the winter season that will start 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.860
 now that it rains a lot and lots of laughs 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.810
 imposed a lot right? 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.020
 so sometimes because it was too deep 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.430
 so that's one way you are also 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.020
 reduce this risk and now also 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.520
 The idea of ​​the research is not to 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.460
 cut the forest to do this 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.350
 system as emphasizing that we use 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.820
 this method here to demonstrate the 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.460
 resource that we have on the property 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.200
 because the project - worries about this the 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.250
 farmer and optimizes the resources you have 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.980
 on property 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.110
 there has not're spending money right has 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.760
 a high cost to implement 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.980
 techniques that he has no condition in 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.530
 then it is time to reuse the resource 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.970
 that really exists by uniting or 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.470
 knowledge of the university with 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.660
 knowledge of producers is that the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.270
 people get rich with the talk and then 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.669
 this one is a demo unit, right? 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.020
 which is maintained by the producers they here 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.300
 do the cleaning to do the maintenance 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.830
 That's the way we've been doing 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.750
 companion installation 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.970
 here everything serves as an example for 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.010
 they can do in the ct respective 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.780
 exactly the result of this 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.880
 research we can do later 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.990
 say look today the search result 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.490
 of the consortium will be with the beans was 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.930
 positive was negative and only they 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.080
 national we will do what 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.780
 Let's identify if the answer 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.910
 and then we proposed the technology 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.850
 for producers 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.810
 initially the experimental part because 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.940
 the farmer himself and makes a 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.260
 experiment he does his research 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.300
 and here we are also making a 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.250
 research - gathering of knowledge 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.380
 the game may experience but since the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.270
 positive results again 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.970
 positive because last year we set up 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.770
 these experimental plots but we 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.600
 we had a problem that some areas 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.330
 were in the bedside area where the 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.850
 The flood was very large and 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.340
 flood the brave areas years experience 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.020
 We lost so he is restarting 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.420
 new this experimental part but the people 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.650
 already with the work in developing in the 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.310
 havre university with results 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.310
 obtained 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.880
 hello my name is heard wickets friends 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.280
 only whistle for the course of 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.650
 dentistry of the uea 5th period 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.580
 I'm here to talk about the project. 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.740
 technology in amazon 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.840
 this project is geared towards all 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.880
 dentist interior surgeons who 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.730
 has implanted health tele system 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.730
 in your municipality this project means 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.070
 for you a way of giving continuity 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.200
 the studies that you have had that 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.690
 use technology also serves to 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.850
 work two educational tools and 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.280
 by helping to maintain education 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.410
 people will work on choice themes 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.780
 of own inside patients have 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.190
 that they find of interest and great 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.040
 importance to work life 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.860
 them and on tele assistance they have the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.090
 possibility of having to request a 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.760
 second opinion for a professional 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.530
 specialist in a certain area within 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.530
 of the field of dentistry 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:44.750
 then this project which is to 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.750
 distance between the capital and the interior
