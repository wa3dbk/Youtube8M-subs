that's giving me the upper hand and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.620 
that's giving me the upper hand and
letting<00:01:13.490> me<00:01:13.670> take<00:01:13.940> advantage<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.510> the

and notes a look sensitivity of above 15
I<00:01:20.720> personally<00:01:21.140> recommend<00:01:21.259> 20<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.100> required<00:01:22.659> ok

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
I personally recommend 20 is required ok

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.510 
I personally recommend 20 is required ok
so<00:01:23.720> jumping<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.440> cover<00:01:24.590> simple<00:01:25.009> enough<00:01:25.220> you

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
so jumping in to cover simple enough you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.700 
so jumping in to cover simple enough you
push<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.909> button<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.509> boom<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.229> jump<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
push a button and boom you jump in to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.850 
push a button and boom you jump in to
cover<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.390> wall<00:01:29.659> bounce<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:30.110> when<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.440> go<00:01:30.619> in

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
cover so a wall bounce is when you go in

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.649 
cover so a wall bounce is when you go in
towards<00:01:31.340> cover<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.940> pull<00:01:32.180> back<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:32.540> your

towards cover but you pull back on your
left<00:01:32.780> analog<00:01:33.229> stick<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.220> canceled<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
left analog stick so you canceled the

the<00:02:07.280> left<00:02:07.460> hand<00:02:07.610> side<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.030> what<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.479> I

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
the left hand side so what I do is I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.410 
the left hand side so what I do is I
wall<00:02:08.989> bounce<00:02:09.229> take<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.190> shot<00:02:10.399> thus<00:02:10.940> avoiding

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
wall bounce take the shot thus avoiding

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.220 
wall bounce take the shot thus avoiding
his<00:02:11.600> shot<00:02:11.810> incoming<00:02:12.230> fire<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.829> take<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.400> kill

his shot incoming fire and take the kill

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.780 
his shot incoming fire and take the kill
so<00:02:15.230> next<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.739> combo<00:02:16.040> wall<00:02:16.220> bouncing<00:02:16.610> this

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so next up is combo wall bouncing this

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.840 
so next up is combo wall bouncing this
is<00:02:16.940> use<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.420> multiple<00:02:18.049> wall<00:02:18.709> bounces<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.489> avoid

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
is use of multiple wall bounces to avoid

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.600 
is use of multiple wall bounces to avoid

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
the left hand side next up we could be

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.060 
the left hand side next up we could be
doing<00:03:45.250> jump<00:03:45.459> evading<00:03:45.850> now<00:03:46.360> when<00:03:46.630> jumping

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
doing jump evading now when jumping

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.070 
doing jump evading now when jumping
you'll<00:03:48.070> notice<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.489> as<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.480> jump<00:03:49.720> back<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
you'll notice that as I jump back to the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.960 
you'll notice that as I jump back to the
center<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.590> always<00:03:50.800> seem<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.340> land<00:03:51.370> at<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.730> same

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
center I always seem to land at the same

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.710 
center I always seem to land at the same
spot<00:03:53.520> ok<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:54.580> when<00:03:54.910> jumping<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.360> have<00:03:55.450> noticed

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
spot ok so when jumping we have noticed

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.470 
spot ok so when jumping we have noticed
a<00:03:55.810> couple<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.170> things<00:03:56.760> firstly<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.330> is

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
a couple of things firstly that it is

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.320 
a couple of things firstly that it is
equidistant<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.640> that<00:04:00.640> means<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:01.000> whenever

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
equidistant and that means that whenever

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330 
equidistant and that means that whenever
I'm<00:04:01.690> jumping<00:04:02.080> I'm<00:04:02.230> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.860> be<00:04:02.950> jumping

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
I'm jumping I'm going to be jumping

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.699 
I'm jumping I'm going to be jumping
exactly<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.510> same<00:04:04.810> position<00:04:05.290> if<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.470> jump

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
exactly to the same position if I jump

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.070 
exactly to the same position if I jump
back<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.370> position<00:04:06.520> so<00:04:07.390> what<00:04:07.600> we<00:04:07.720> can<00:04:07.870> do

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
back to that position so what we can do

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.810 
back to that position so what we can do
is<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:08.380> can<00:04:08.410> use<00:04:08.709> this<00:04:08.860> against<00:04:09.190> our<00:04:09.340> opponents

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
is we can use this against our opponents

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.840 
is we can use this against our opponents
say<00:04:10.540> my<00:04:10.690> opponent<00:04:11.050> isn't<00:04:11.170> cover<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> song<00:04:12.520> or

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
say my opponent isn't cover as a song or

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.840 
say my opponent isn't cover as a song or
a<00:04:13.360> would<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.920> behind<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.070> done<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.459> truck<00:04:15.670> as

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
a would be behind this done so truck as

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.880 
a would be behind this done so truck as
I<00:04:16.299> jump<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.750> right<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:16.930> know<00:04:17.230> exactly<00:04:17.410> where

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
I jump to the right I know exactly where

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.440 
I jump to the right I know exactly where
I'm<00:04:17.950> going<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.190> land<00:04:18.370> therefore<00:04:19.270> I<00:04:19.299> know

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
I'm going to land therefore I know

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.580 
I'm going to land therefore I know
exactly<00:04:19.660> where<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.320> take<00:04:20.500> my<00:04:20.650> shot

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
exactly where I can take my shot

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.500 
exactly where I can take my shot
this<00:04:23.220> can<00:04:23.370> also<00:04:23.520> be<00:04:23.610> done<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> left

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
this can also be done in to the left

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.460 
this can also be done in to the left
hand<00:04:24.720> side<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:27.270> will<00:04:27.449> be<00:04:27.630> showing<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.260> if

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
hand side now we will be showing you if

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.470

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
I jump to the left hand side because I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.840
