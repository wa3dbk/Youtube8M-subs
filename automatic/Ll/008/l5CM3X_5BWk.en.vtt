00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Driving loud noise and emitting a lot of exhaust motorcycles 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The days have passed, 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 But environmentally friendly motorcycles are the future trend. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Now let us appreciate 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 The most amazing invention by Time magazine 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 ENV hydrogen fuel motorcycle, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 It was brought together by Intelligent Energy and product design consultancy Seymourpowell. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 It will be the benchmark for alternative energy. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Take a look at this video. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Intelligent Energy is an international energy systems company 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 It has created world-class hydrogen fuel cell technology. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 What exactly is energy cell technology? 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 It is a hydrogen that can be 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Electromechanical equipment that converts electricity and heat. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Simply put, this technology can make us 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Use hydrogen as a clean source of energy. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 ENV motorcycle brought by Intelligent Energy 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Essentially a silent 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And motorcycles that only emit pure water vapor. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Its top speed is 50 miles per hour. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 With a box of compressed hydrogen, it can travel 100 miles. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 ENV stands for “neutral emission of motorcycles”. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 It is very light and looks like a mountain bike. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Intelligent Energy's Fuel Cell Technology 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It is very important to our future. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 It not only allows us to stop using fossil fuels, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 It can also solve current environmental problems as well as energy supply challenges. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 The ENV motorcycle is just the beginning, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It can represent a hydrogen fuel cell car, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 And the beginning of a new era of other means of transportation 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 By using this new energy, all our motorcycles and cars 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 In theory, it will become a zero pollution tool. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 It will also make our planet cleaner and more sustainable. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 More importantly, fuel cell technology can 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 For example like motorboats and small houses 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Such large machines are powered. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Maybe one day, it will be a source of our daily energy supply.
