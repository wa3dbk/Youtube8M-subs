for<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.410> mic<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.460> might<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.149> damage<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for my mic you might be some damage to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.619 
for my mic you might be some damage to
the<00:01:00.989> leaf<00:01:01.199> source<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.489> drop<00:01:02.850> some<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the leaf source up for my drop some and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.690 
the leaf source up for my drop some and
then<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:05.040> light<00:01:05.869> it<00:01:06.869> likes<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.700> about

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
then with light it likes to have about

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
then with light it likes to have about
in<00:01:09.150> direct<00:01:09.630> sunlight<00:01:09.960> most<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
in direct sunlight most of the time it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
in direct sunlight most of the time it
will<00:01:11.850> tolerate<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.780> direct<00:01:13.170> sunlight<00:01:13.439> like

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
will tolerate some direct sunlight like

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.210 
will tolerate some direct sunlight like
in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> morning<00:01:14.729> hours<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.290> plant<00:01:16.920> does

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in the morning hours which my plant does

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
in the morning hours which my plant does
get<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.560> our<00:01:19.560> water<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.549> derive<00:01:20.970> end<00:01:21.600> up

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
get and our water with to derive end up

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.280 
get and our water with to derive end up
and<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.890> watery<00:01:23.340> too<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.900> roots

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and don't watery too much or the roots

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.700 
and don't watery too much or the roots
will<00:01:25.950> rot<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.990> soon<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
will rot and soon I would make a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
will rot and soon I would make a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
a lot of the surviving leaves and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.570 
a lot of the surviving leaves and
attempted<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.780> propagate<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.070> work<00:02:33.280> it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
attempted to propagate it and it work it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.410 
attempted to propagate it and it work it
has<00:02:33.820> rooted<00:02:34.270> but<00:02:34.540> now<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.530> has<00:02:36.030> things<00:02:37.030> well

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
