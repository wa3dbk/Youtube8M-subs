the<00:01:49.619> black<00:01:49.890> man<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.759> been<00:01:50.970> exploited<00:01:51.450> ever

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the black man has been exploited ever

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.289 
the black man has been exploited ever
since<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.530> discovered<00:01:53.070> gravity<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
since we discovered gravity are you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.730 
since we discovered gravity are you
planted<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.200> read<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
planted then I read about this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
planted then I read about this
discovered<00:01:56.250> revenue<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
discovered revenue just you say the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.270 
discovered revenue just you say the
black<00:01:57.780> man<00:01:58.020> discovered<00:01:58.560> gravity<00:01:58.770> that's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
black man discovered gravity that's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789 
black man discovered gravity that's
right<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> white<00:01:59.969> devil<00:02:00.450> Newton<00:02:00.899> were<00:02:01.469> paid

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
right the white devil Newton were paid

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.340 
right the white devil Newton were paid
for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> discovery<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> gravity<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
for the discovery of gravity and the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.039 
for the discovery of gravity and the
back<00:02:04.649> man<00:02:04.860> received<00:02:05.369> nothing<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.119> say<00:02:06.360> the

back man received nothing you say the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
back man received nothing you say the
laws<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.890> gravity<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.819> greatest<00:02:09.239> law<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
laws of gravity and the greatest law the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.650 
laws of gravity and the greatest law the
day<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.400> am<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> law<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> black

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
day is because that am the law the black

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.240 
day is because that am the law the black
man

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
man

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.460 
man
not<00:02:13.370> break<00:02:13.670> right<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.690> respect<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> laws

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
not break right now you respect the laws

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.050 
not break right now you respect the laws
of<00:02:15.650> gravity<00:02:16.040> because<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.460> black<00:02:16.670> man<00:02:16.850> can

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
of gravity because the black man can

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.470 
of gravity because the black man can
break<00:02:17.300> them<00:02:17.510> we<00:02:18.130> African<00:02:19.130> race<00:02:19.340> tried<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.450> hard

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
break them we African race tried so hard

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.200 
break them we African race tried so hard
in<00:02:21.050> deepest<00:02:21.380> topic<00:02:21.800> Africa<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.700> break<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.060> law

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
in deepest topic Africa to break the law

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900 
in deepest topic Africa to break the law
of<00:02:23.510> gravity<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.530> throw<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.100> spear<00:02:25.340> up<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of gravity we throw the spear up in the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.330 
of gravity we throw the spear up in the
air<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.510> come<00:02:26.720> down<00:02:26.960> now<00:02:27.860> as<00:02:27.920> many<00:02:28.130> times

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
air and it come down now as many times

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.490 
air and it come down now as many times
so<00:02:29.210> as<00:02:29.300> many<00:02:29.480> times<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.840> throw<00:02:29.959> your<00:02:30.170> Spears

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
so as many times you throw your Spears

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.990 
so as many times you throw your Spears
up<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.860> air<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.160> would<00:02:31.250> all<00:02:31.490> fall<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
up in the air they would all fall to the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.350 
up in the air they would all fall to the
ground

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360

you teach this stuff in a legitimate
College<00:02:56.420> that's<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:57.350> back<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.830> your

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
College that's right you go back in your

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.760 
College that's right you go back in your
history<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:59.630> will<00:02:59.810> see<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.530> black

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770
