00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
quite stretchy but not so stretchy that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
quite stretchy but not so stretchy that
they<00:01:06.299> lose<00:01:06.510> their<00:01:06.570> fit<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> their<00:01:08.130> shape<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
they lose their fit and their shape and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
they lose their fit and their shape and

they also feature the black stripes on
either<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.970> add<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> little

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
either side so they just add a little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.899 
either side so they just add a little
bit<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> edge<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> sort<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
bit of edge and they make you sort of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
bit of edge and they make you sort of
pop<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> snow<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.400> cool

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
pop out in the snow which is really cool

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
pop out in the snow which is really cool
in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> winter<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.750> dark<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.799> see

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
in the winter when it's dark and you see
somebody<00:01:20.280> wearing<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.670> bright<00:01:20.909> jeans<00:01:21.180> and

they're fringe booties that I've seen

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.040 
they're fringe booties that I've seen
out<00:03:28.070> there<00:03:28.100> they<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.270> this<00:03:29.480> sort<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> notch

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
out there they have this sort of notch

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.220 
out there they have this sort of notch
on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> outside<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.490> either<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.870> outside

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
of the foot on either shoe and that adds

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.840 
of the foot on either shoe and that adds
a<00:03:36.380> nice<00:03:36.500> touch<00:03:36.830> because<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.460> have<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> bare

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
a nice touch because if you have a bare

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.370 
a nice touch because if you have a bare
leg<00:03:38.120> which<00:03:38.450> I'll<00:03:38.600> probably<00:03:38.810> wear<00:03:39.020> these<00:03:39.200> with

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
leg which I'll probably wear these with

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.960 
leg which I'll probably wear these with
the<00:03:39.470> bare<00:03:39.650> leg<00:03:39.830> just<00:03:40.070> so<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.550> see<00:03:40.790> that

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
the bare leg just so you can see that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.840 
the bare leg just so you can see that
effect<00:03:41.330> even<00:03:41.510> though<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:41.870> cold<00:03:42.080> out<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:43.550> just

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
effect even though it's cold out it just

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.520 
effect even though it's cold out it just
sort<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.030> along<00:03:44.360> gates<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.810> leg<00:03:44.990> even<00:03:45.230> more

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
sort of along gates the leg even more

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.410 
sort of along gates the leg even more
because<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:45.920> see<00:03:46.160> through<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:47.060> sort<00:03:47.360> of

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
because you see through that sort of

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.650 
because you see through that sort of
notch<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:48.020> slit<00:03:48.380> more<00:03:48.980> leg<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.660> it's

notch and that slit more leg and it's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.110 
notch and that slit more leg and it's
just<00:03:50.900> unique<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.770> haven't<00:03:52.070> seen<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.700> know<00:03:52.820> it's

shoes that you recently saw but this is

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980 
shoes that you recently saw but this is
just<00:04:07.790> something<00:04:07.940> different<00:04:08.210> and<00:04:08.660> they<00:04:08.840> also

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
just something different and they also

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.690 
just something different and they also
feature<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.500> zipper<00:04:09.860> on<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.100> inside<00:04:10.130> they're

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
feature a zipper on the inside they're

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.790 
feature a zipper on the inside they're
really<00:04:10.910> easy<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.270> slip<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.630> off<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:12.080> the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
really easy to slip on off and on the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800 
really easy to slip on off and on the
leather<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.160> them<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.670> really<00:04:14.000> buttery<00:04:14.450> soft

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
leather on them is really buttery soft

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.440 
leather on them is really buttery soft
and<00:04:15.230> it's<00:04:15.500> pebbled<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.820> think<00:04:17.000> that's<00:04:17.330> even

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
and it's pebbled so I think that's even

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.670 
and it's pebbled so I think that's even
better<00:04:17.720> than<00:04:17.960> smooth<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.410> for<00:04:18.590> this

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
better than smooth it for this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.910 
better than smooth it for this
