00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.460 

so<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.550> create<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.240> candle<00:03:01.750> mason<00:03:02.080> jar<00:03:02.260> thing

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so to create this candle mason jar thing

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.180 
so to create this candle mason jar thing
you<00:03:02.830> will<00:03:03.100> need<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.900> mason<00:03:04.900> jar<00:03:04.930> some<00:03:05.620> beads<00:03:05.860> I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you will need a mason jar some beads I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.710 
you will need a mason jar some beads I
pick<00:03:06.490> clear<00:03:06.820> wilds<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> candle<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.600> some

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
pick clear wilds a candle and some

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.510 
pick clear wilds a candle and some
matches<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> first<00:03:12.160> thing<00:03:12.280> you're<00:03:12.400> going

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
matches so the first thing you're going

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.610 
matches so the first thing you're going
to<00:03:12.580> want<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.880> do<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.270> tip<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:13.960> all<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.440> beads

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
to want to do is tip in all your beads

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.680 
to want to do is tip in all your beads
into<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.190> jar<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.420> got<00:03:19.540> my

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
into the jar and then I just got my

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.350 
into the jar and then I just got my
candle<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.260> put<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.470> central<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.730> jar<00:03:22.000> arm

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
candle and put it central in the jar arm

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360 
candle and put it central in the jar arm
so<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> beads<00:03:23.050> would<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.680> hold<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.250> place

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
so the beads would like hold it in place

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.280 
so the beads would like hold it in place
and<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.210> just<00:03:25.450> lit<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> candle<00:03:26.140> and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
and then I just lit the candle and

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.170 
and then I just lit the candle and
that's<00:03:26.560> literally<00:03:26.980> all<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.250> have<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:27.820> then

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
that's literally all you have to do then

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060 
that's literally all you have to do then
just<00:03:28.390> screw<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.630> rim<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.470> think<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:29.920> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
just screw the rim on and I think in the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.280 
just screw the rim on and I think in the
so<00:03:30.340> call<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:31.240> just<00:03:31.510> makes<00:03:31.660> your<00:03:31.810> desk<00:03:32.050> or<00:03:32.260> a
