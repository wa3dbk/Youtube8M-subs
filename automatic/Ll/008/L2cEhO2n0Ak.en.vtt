yeah well what he's basically seeing his
virtual<00:02:46.060> camera<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.569> was<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.260> lead

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
virtual camera I was one of the lead

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.860 
virtual camera I was one of the lead
cinema<00:02:48.400> virtual<00:02:48.730> artists<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.150> Avatar<00:02:49.629> and

cinema virtual artists on Avatar and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
cinema virtual artists on Avatar and
basically<00:02:50.560> we're<00:02:50.950> working<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.370> film<00:02:51.609> we

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
basically we're working on that film we

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.479 
basically we're working on that film we
you<00:02:52.359> know<00:02:52.480> Jim<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.139> just<00:02:53.319> walking<00:02:54.099> around<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.430> a

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
you know Jim is just walking around in a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.879 
you know Jim is just walking around in a
virtual<00:02:54.639> space<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.510> he's<00:02:55.989> he's<00:02:56.349> shooting

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
virtual space and he's he's shooting

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.379 
virtual space and he's he's shooting
stuff<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.219> really<00:02:57.579> doesn't<00:02:57.730> exist<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.299> know

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
stuff that really doesn't exist you know

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.959 
stuff that really doesn't exist you know
and<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:59.019> what<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.290> wanted<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.859> was<00:03:00.010> have

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
and so what we wanted to do was have

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.789 
and so what we wanted to do was have
something<00:03:01.299> similar<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.840> after<00:03:02.260> avatar<00:03:02.409> we'll

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
something similar for after avatar we'll

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.470 
something similar for after avatar we'll
work<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.159> other<00:03:03.340> visual<00:03:03.730> effects<00:03:04.030> shows<00:03:04.209> I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
work on other visual effects shows I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.300 
work on other visual effects shows I
mean<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:04.870> cool<00:03:04.989> thing<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.499> is<00:03:05.650> you've

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
mean the cool thing with it is you've

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.339 
mean the cool thing with it is you've
got<00:03:06.489> added<00:03:06.819> scale<00:03:07.120> as<00:03:07.329> well<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.719> for<00:03:07.930> example

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
got added scale as well so for example

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.899 
got added scale as well so for example
you<00:03:08.799> know<00:03:08.889> right<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:09.159> every<00:03:09.459> step<00:03:09.669> that<00:03:09.790> he

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
you know right now every step that he

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.300 
you know right now every step that he
takes<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.389> virtual<00:03:10.689> world<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.260> equal<00:03:12.129> to<00:03:12.280> a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
takes in the virtual world is equal to a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.759 
takes in the virtual world is equal to a
step<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.299> real<00:03:13.449> life<00:03:13.659> but<00:03:13.900> we've<00:03:14.049> got<00:03:14.290> scaling

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
step in real life but we've got scaling

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.409 
step in real life but we've got scaling
controls<00:03:15.129> as<00:03:15.280> well<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.669> if<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.879> wanted<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.180> for

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
controls as well so if you wanted to for

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.750 
controls as well so if you wanted to for
example<00:03:16.449> be<00:03:17.409> a<00:03:17.439> helicopter<00:03:18.069> instead<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.549> fly

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
example be a helicopter instead and fly

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.610 
example be a helicopter instead and fly
through<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.120> whole<00:03:19.239> scene<00:03:19.569> we<00:03:20.139> just<00:03:20.169> scale

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
through the whole scene we just scale

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.069 
through the whole scene we just scale
them<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.069> now<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.540> know<00:03:22.569> he<00:03:22.719> can<00:03:22.870> fly

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
them up and now like you know he can fly

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.420 
them up and now like you know he can fly
through<00:03:23.409> them<00:03:23.500> real<00:03:23.859> quick<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.219> he<00:03:24.310> can

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
through them real quick and he can

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.770 
through them real quick and he can
actually<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.969> know<00:03:25.000> conversely<00:03:25.510> he<00:03:25.569> can<00:03:25.689> be

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
actually you know conversely he can be

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.490 
actually you know conversely he can be
real<00:03:25.989> small

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
real small

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.289 
real small

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
playing online in the same match that's

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.660 
playing online in the same match that's
awesome<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.230> how<00:04:07.799> do<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.040> deal<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.519> stuff

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
awesome so how do you deal with stuff

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.880 
awesome so how do you deal with stuff
like<00:04:08.760> say<00:04:09.450> Call<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.019> Duty<00:04:10.379> it'd<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.620> really

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
like say Call of Duty it'd be really

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.890 
like say Call of Duty it'd be really
hard<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.129> get<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> PC<00:04:11.640> player<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.540> console

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
hard to get a PC player and a console

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.360 
hard to get a PC player and a console
player<00:04:13.049> due<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.650> limitations<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
player due to the limitations of the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.520 
player due to the limitations of the
console<00:04:14.790> player<00:04:14.940> with<00:04:15.299> controls<00:04:15.750> how<00:04:16.350> do<00:04:16.410> you

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
console player with controls how do you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.259 
console player with controls how do you
guys<00:04:16.680> deal<00:04:17.100> with<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.340> issue

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
guys deal with that issue

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.969 
guys deal with that issue
yeah<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.079> mean<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.410> have<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> completely

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
yeah so I mean we have a completely

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.159 
yeah so I mean we have a completely
different<00:04:20.070> control<00:04:20.699> scheme<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.150> tablet<00:04:21.720> than

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
different control scheme on tablet than

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.090 
different control scheme on tablet than
on<00:04:22.500> PC<00:04:23.160> ps3<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.729> xbox360<00:04:24.630> but<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.410> game<00:04:25.620> works

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
on PC ps3 and xbox360 but the game works

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.250 
on PC ps3 and xbox360 but the game works
the<00:04:26.370> same<00:04:26.550> exact<00:04:26.910> way<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.180> instead<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.960> moving
