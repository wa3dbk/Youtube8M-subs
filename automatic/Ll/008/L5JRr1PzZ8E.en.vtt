00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
then it's been a couple of weeks I think

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.779 
then it's been a couple of weeks I think
it's<00:00:18.259> been<00:00:18.439> about<00:00:18.470> two<00:00:18.919> weeks<00:00:18.949> since<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.550> first

it's been about two weeks since I first
discovered<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:21.520> foreign<00:00:22.520> bugs<00:00:22.730> here<00:00:25.750> and

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
discovered the foreign bugs here and

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.589 
discovered the foreign bugs here and
they<00:00:28.669> have<00:00:28.849> really<00:00:28.879> grown<00:00:29.570> in<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:29.989> last<00:00:31.599> few

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
they have really grown in the last few

they have really grown in the last few
days<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.440> can<00:00:33.469> see<00:00:34.040> they<00:00:34.250> really<00:00:34.579> started<00:00:34.879> to

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
days you can see they really started to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.119 
days you can see they really started to
take<00:00:35.270> on<00:00:36.520> their<00:00:37.520> colors<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:39.440> one<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:39.920> below

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
take on their colors the one just below

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.069 
take on their colors the one just below
is<00:00:40.610> what<00:00:40.789> they<00:00:40.940> look<00:00:41.149> like<00:00:41.180> when<00:00:41.930> they're

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
is what they look like when they're

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.990 
is what they look like when they're
younger<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:45.250> for<00:00:46.250> some<00:00:46.460> reason<00:00:46.880> they're

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
younger and for some reason they're

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.940 
younger and for some reason they're
growing<00:00:47.329> at<00:00:47.450> different<00:00:47.600> rates<00:00:48.579> anyhow<00:00:49.579> these

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
growing at different rates anyhow these

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.180 
growing at different rates anyhow these
are<00:00:53.380> really<00:00:54.380> coming<00:00:54.620> into<00:00:54.829> their<00:00:55.040> own<00:00:55.070> and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
a few of the smaller ones up here as

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
a few of the smaller ones up here as
well

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
well

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.650 
well
they<00:02:24.190> say<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.430> don't<00:02:24.490> understand<00:02:25.150> why<00:02:25.390> they're

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
they say I don't understand why they're

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.900 
they say I don't understand why they're
growing<00:02:25.960> at<00:02:26.080> different<00:02:26.410> rates<00:02:27.960> but<00:02:29.700> some<00:02:30.700> of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
growing at different rates but some of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.940 
growing at different rates but some of
them<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.180> definitely<00:02:31.780> matured<00:02:32.050> more<00:02:32.500> rapid

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
them have definitely matured more rapid

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.920 
them have definitely matured more rapid
it<00:02:33.040> looks<00:02:33.190> like<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.550> lot<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.240> them<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.810> are

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it looks like a lot of them that are

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.890 
it looks like a lot of them that are
mature<00:02:35.080> might<00:02:35.560> be<00:02:35.740> males<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.660> believe<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.840> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
mature might be males I believe this is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750 
mature might be males I believe this is
a<00:02:38.080> male<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> making<00:02:39.100> right<00:02:39.250> here<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
a male in the making right here the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
a male in the making right here the
males<00:02:40.440> they<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.070> club<00:02:42.550> shaped

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
males they get kind of a club shaped

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.550 
males they get kind of a club shaped
thorn<00:02:44.950> up<00:02:45.190> there<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.580> top<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.990> starts<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
thorn up there at the top it starts to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.060 
thorn up there at the top it starts to
square<00:02:47.920> off<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.230> see<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:50.650> here<00:02:50.710> that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
square off you can see down here that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.030 
square off you can see down here that
the<00:02:51.430> mother<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.420> female<00:02:52.900> has<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> very<00:02:53.530> pointy

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
the mother the female has a very pointy

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.220 
the mother the female has a very pointy
one<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.610> one<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.030> directly<00:02:55.540> behind<00:02:55.750> her

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
one and the one just directly behind her

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.860 
one and the one just directly behind her
is<00:02:56.980> beginning<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.790> Club<00:02:58.240> shaped<00:03:00.870> these

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
is beginning of that Club shaped these

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.280 
is beginning of that Club shaped these
thorn<00:03:02.350> bugs<00:03:03.090> will<00:03:04.090> lay<00:03:04.330> their<00:03:04.600> eggs<00:03:04.900> on<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
thorn bugs will lay their eggs on the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.160 
thorn bugs will lay their eggs on the
ends<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.980> these<00:03:06.690> branches<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:08.080> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
ends of these branches and I think I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.430 
ends of these branches and I think I
just<00:03:08.200> located<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.950> fresh<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.780> see<00:03:11.170> that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
just located a fresh if you can see that

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.180 
just located a fresh if you can see that
white<00:03:11.800> area<00:03:12.220> there<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:13.440> believe<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:17.190> where

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
white area there I believe that is where

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.340 
white area there I believe that is where
some<00:03:18.880> eggs<00:03:19.210> have<00:03:19.420> been<00:03:19.570> laid<00:03:19.780> right<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
some eggs have been laid right in that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.410 
some eggs have been laid right in that
white<00:03:20.620> area<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.040> if<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> look<00:03:21.520> down<00:03:21.820> just

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
white area and if you look down just

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.780 
white area and if you look down just
below<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.310> can<00:03:24.490> see<00:03:24.790> there's<00:03:25.060> another<00:03:25.450> female

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
below you can see there's another female

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.270 
below you can see there's another female
foreign<00:03:27.790> bug<00:03:28.000> right<00:03:28.330> there<00:03:29.130> guarding<00:03:30.130> those

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
foreign bug right there guarding those

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.330 
foreign bug right there guarding those
eggs<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.020> those<00:03:32.350> are<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> eggs<00:03:32.800> right

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
eggs so I think those are the eggs right

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.970 
eggs so I think those are the eggs right
there<00:03:34.920> pretty<00:03:36.870> close<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.110> having<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.500> second

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
there pretty close to having a second

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.250 
there pretty close to having a second
colony<00:03:39.460> on<00:03:39.640> here<00:03:39.940> I'll<00:03:40.300> know<00:03:40.570> for<00:03:40.600> sure<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
colony on here I'll know for sure in a

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.350 
colony on here I'll know for sure in a
couple<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> days<00:03:41.770> I<00:03:42.160> would<00:03:42.790> say<00:03:42.970> there's<00:03:43.180> no

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
couple of days I would say there's no

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.250 
couple of days I would say there's no
doubt<00:03:43.570> about<00:03:43.600> it

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
doubt about it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.550 
doubt about it
I<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.950> found<00:03:45.130> another<00:03:45.340> tip<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.060> branch

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
I just found another tip of a branch

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.150 
I just found another tip of a branch
with<00:03:47.560> what<00:03:47.710> looks<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.010> eggs<00:03:48.460> on<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
with what looks like eggs on it and the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.210 
with what looks like eggs on it and the
reason<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.610> say<00:03:51.970> that

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
reason I say that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.300 
reason I say that
because<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.460> has<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.060> two<00:03:55.270> little<00:03:55.450> slits<00:03:56.310> with

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
because it has the two little slits with

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.860 
because it has the two little slits with
all<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.610> white<00:03:57.820> eggs<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.300> then<00:03:58.390> if<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.600> look

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
all the white eggs and then if you look

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.820 
all the white eggs and then if you look
down<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.800> branch<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.990> little<00:04:01.990> ways<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.710> can

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
down the branch a little ways if I can

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.190 
down the branch a little ways if I can
get<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.040> light<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.490> it<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:04.990> keep

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
get my light on it you just keep

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.810 
get my light on it you just keep
following<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.710> branch<00:04:05.920> down<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:08.400> OOP<00:04:09.400> there

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
following the branch down and OOP there

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.400 
following the branch down and OOP there
you<00:04:09.970> go<00:04:11.010> there's<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.250> mother<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:14.080> one<00:04:14.230> who

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you go there's the mother the one who

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.210 
you go there's the mother the one who
laid<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.980> eggs<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.930> they<00:04:17.320> lay<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.799> eggs<00:04:17.950> on

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
laid the eggs so they lay the eggs on

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.370 
laid the eggs so they lay the eggs on
the<00:04:18.370> tips<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.900> branches

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.710 

and<00:04:25.470> she<00:04:26.190> already<00:04:26.460> has<00:04:26.760> hers<00:04:27.090> there<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.510> just

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and she already has hers there I just

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.450 
and she already has hers there I just
realized<00:04:28.610> they're<00:04:29.610> tiny<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:31.250> they've<00:04:32.250> all

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
realized they're tiny but they've all

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.130 
realized they're tiny but they've all
hatched<00:04:33.560> out<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.100> tip<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:35.730> here<00:04:36.140> you

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
hatched out of this tip right here you

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.990 
hatched out of this tip right here you
can<00:04:37.290> see<00:04:37.500> all<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.830> egg<00:04:38.040> cases<00:04:38.580> are<00:04:38.730> white

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
can see all the egg cases are white

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.200 
can see all the egg cases are white
because<00:04:39.270> they've<00:04:39.600> hatched<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
because they've hatched it's just the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.500 
because they've hatched it's just the
empty<00:04:42.420> leftover<00:04:45.080> egg<00:04:46.080> case<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.300> then<00:04:48.300> there

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
empty leftover egg case and then there

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.580 
empty leftover egg case and then there
she<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.840> right<00:04:49.410> down<00:04:49.710> here<00:04:51.290> with<00:04:52.290> a<00:04:52.320> whole

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
she is right down here with a whole

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.830 
she is right down here with a whole
brood<00:04:52.920> of<00:04:53.100> newly<00:04:53.430> hatched<00:04:53.610> thorn<00:04:54.120> bugs<00:04:54.390> so
