lasers that's right cats and lasers so

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
lasers that's right cats and lasers so
we<00:00:20.160> went<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.400> made<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> short<00:00:21.029> film<00:00:21.090> all<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.810> our

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
we went out made a short film all on our

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.340 
we went out made a short film all on our

own about both cats and lasers and I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.759 
own about both cats and lasers and I
gotta<00:00:25.560> tell<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.609> came<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.029> great<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.050> I

think<00:00:29.099> it'll<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.310> perfect<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> show<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
think it'll be perfect for the show I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.190 
think it'll be perfect for the show I
don't<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.109> doesn't<00:00:31.470> sound<00:00:31.740> good<00:00:33.200> okay
