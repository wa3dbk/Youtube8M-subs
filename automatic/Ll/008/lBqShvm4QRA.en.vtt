I<00:01:13.580> remember<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> by<00:01:14.970> thinking<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> Broca's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

I remember this by thinking that Broca's
aphasia<00:01:16.350> means<00:01:16.890> broken<00:01:17.520> speech<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> aphasia

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
aphasia means broken speech and aphasia

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.289 
aphasia means broken speech and aphasia
is<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.130> type<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.729> disorder<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
is just any type of disorder that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
is just any type of disorder that

interesting side effects in terms of

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
can't connect to the language side so

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.110 
can't connect to the language side so
anything<00:05:11.920> that<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.130> perceive<00:05:12.700> on<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:12.970> right

dealt with in terms of language now you

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.290 
dealt with in terms of language now you
may<00:05:17.920> have<00:05:18.010> heard<00:05:18.280> before<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.940> your<00:05:19.060> brain

brain and vice versa so let's think

brain and vice versa so let's think
about<00:05:30.070> what<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.340> means<00:05:30.730> for<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.180> split<00:05:31.420> brain

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
about what that means for a split brain

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.380 
about what that means for a split brain
