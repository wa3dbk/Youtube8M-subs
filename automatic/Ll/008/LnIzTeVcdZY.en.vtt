00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.210

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.800
 mustache and his work uniform bears 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.800
 Green does not remember a certain couple 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.130

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.400
 malone as heel carry a brooch with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 the shape of a well-known character of the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 saga of mario if we approach them and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.400
 we observe carefully we see how the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.040
 Brooch has the shape of the face of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.040
 well-known enemy of mario bowser 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.820
 did you know that the music that plays in the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 temple of fire is not the same in all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.600
 the cartridges of the ocarina of time safe 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.830
 that you remember the theme that sounded 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.420
 while we go into the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.420
 depths of this temple truth 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 It turns out that before going on sale 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.300
 the game in the usa some lucky ones 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 they could access some cartridges 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.750
 limited edition gold that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.300
 they got having booked the game 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.650
 in advance in said cartridges the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.000
 music that sounds in the tempo of fire 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.870
 it's different from the one that sounds in the rest 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.200
 of copies 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 hear 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.280
 then because the attempt decided 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.709
 change the song and place it in its place 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.209
 the one we all know if we listen 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.830
 this part of music in particular 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.830
 we can follow in the background some chants 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.090
 it seems these songs are remains 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.760
 Islamic means there is no other god 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.349
 rather than to attempt it must surely 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.000
 think that it was best to change the subject 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.959
 musical before getting into trouble 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.959
 of a religious nature 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.959
 you knew that the inc is a troll of a lot 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.170
 Take care of your favorite activities 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.750
 is to enter other people's houses without 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.269
 permits to break all the vases that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.600
 find in his path or mistreat the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.850
 poor groups 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.340
 this time we will talk about a case 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.010
 special if you go to the fishing area of 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.960
 Lake illia the kind dependent we 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.720
 will invite us to spend our rupees 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.760
 in a quiet fishing session what 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.280
 curious is that fish is not the only thing 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.190
 that you can fish if you point the rod 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.620
 towards the clerk you can skype your 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.020
 sailor cap if you're a good Saturday 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.090
 you can return the hat but if 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.400
 you are a job you can take the hat 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.520
 that is hooked to the cane and throw it 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.850
 to the lake where it will sink to the deepest 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.620
 and it will be impossible to recover that yes no 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.600
 wait to leave because the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.590
 dependent will make you pay a fine of 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.590
 50 rupees 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.650
 did you know that the stones of truth 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.390
 they react in many different ways 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.450
 depending on how on tractors with 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.400
 they will usually tell you now yes 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.959
 you hit them with the sword but this is not 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.120
 everything if you back with the hammer 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.739
 megatone the stones that were covered 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 against the ground for a few seconds 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.759
 if you wear the mask of truth 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.710
 being the child link you can talk to 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.810
 them and they will reveal secrets to you and our 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.150
 favorite that is to put a bomb 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.650
 to the lake after exploding the stone 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.990
 it will change color and start emitting 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.910
 some strange noises after which it will leave 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.300
