at this point looks like some quality

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.979 
at this point looks like some quality
hardware<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.739> said<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.400> new<00:02:53.989> quality

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
hardware that said this new quality

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.440 
hardware that said this new quality
hardware<00:02:55.530> comes<00:02:55.890> at<00:02:56.010> an<00:02:56.130> expense<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:57.239> you're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hardware comes at an expense when you're

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.479 
hardware comes at an expense when you're
using<00:02:57.720> these<00:02:57.930> materials<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.709> usually<00:02:59.220> means

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
using these materials that usually means

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.509 
using these materials that usually means
that<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.540> not<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> removable<00:03:01.620> back<00:03:01.980> so

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
that you do not have a removable back so

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.670 
that you do not have a removable back so
therefore<00:03:02.849> you're<00:03:03.030> giving<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.569> your<00:03:03.780> SD<00:03:04.410> card

therefore you're giving up your SD card

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.339 
therefore you're giving up your SD card
expansion<00:03:05.549> as<00:03:05.760> well<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.569> removable<00:03:07.049> battery

that the previous generation featured

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.970 
that the previous generation featured

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
but I think they're going to probably

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.759

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
fingerprint sensor and my goodness is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.540 
fingerprint sensor and my goodness is
this<00:04:48.620> heavily<00:04:49.620> improved<00:04:50.040> over<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.340> previous
