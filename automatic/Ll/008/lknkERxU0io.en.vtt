00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
about first of all when I say standard

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.730 
about first of all when I say standard
tuning<00:00:15.440> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.770> guitar<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.220> way<00:00:17.390> a

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
tuning this is for guitar by the way a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.540 
tuning this is for guitar by the way a
standard<00:00:19.740> tuning<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.430> e<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:22.220> d<00:00:23.220> g<00:00:23.850> b<00:00:24.359> e<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.550> if

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
standard tuning is e a d g b e and if

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
standard tuning is e a d g b e and if
you<00:00:26.869> that<00:00:27.869> that's<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:28.349> bottom<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> top

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you that that's from bottom to top

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
you that that's from bottom to top
bottom<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.699> well<00:00:30.240> bottom<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> top

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
bottom is that well bottom is the top

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049 
bottom is that well bottom is the top
and<00:00:31.230> 12<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.590> bottom<00:00:31.949> isn't<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and 12 is the bottom isn't it this is

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
and 12 is the bottom isn't it this is
the<00:00:33.180> bottom<00:00:33.329> string<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> sixth

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the bottom string so this is the sixth

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
the bottom string so this is the sixth
string<00:00:35.460> 5<00:00:36.329> 4<00:00:36.930> 3<00:00:37.350> 2<00:00:37.469> 1<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.110> say<00:00:40.379> play

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
string 5 4 3 2 1 so if I say play

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
string 5 4 3 2 1 so if I say play
something<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> second<00:00:41.579> string<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.149> means

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
something on the second string it means

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
something on the second string it means
the<00:00:42.600> B<00:00:42.719> string<00:00:43.020> um<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:45.770> link<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.920> couple<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the B string um I will link a couple of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760 
the B string um I will link a couple of
tuning<00:00:48.000> sites<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.750> case<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
tuning sites in case you don't have a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310 
tuning sites in case you don't have a
tuner<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.340> basically<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.660> click<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
tuner it basically you click on the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.880 
tuner it basically you click on the
string<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> tuned<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
string that you want it tuned to and it

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
string that you want it tuned to and it
plays<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> note<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.579> tune<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.180> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
plays the note and you tune it to that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.410 
plays the note and you tune it to that
using<00:00:59.030> those<00:01:00.030> pegs

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.929 

to<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.799> standard<00:01:07.070> tuning<00:01:07.400> if<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.790> say

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
to do so the standard tuning if I say

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.999 
to do so the standard tuning if I say
drop<00:01:08.150> D<00:01:08.479> tuning<00:01:08.540> because<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> lot<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.619> our<00:01:09.770> songs

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
drop D tuning because a lot of our songs

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.490 
drop D tuning because a lot of our songs
are<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.250> drop<00:01:10.430> D<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.750> same<00:01:12.049> tuning

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
are in drop D it's the same tuning

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.870 
are in drop D it's the same tuning
except<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.430> bottom<00:01:13.759> a<00:01:13.970> string<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.659> one<00:01:14.869> is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
except the bottom a string this one is

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.180 
except the bottom a string this one is
going<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.970> be<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> d<00:01:17.540> not<00:01:17.869> an<00:01:18.020> e<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:18.950> down<00:01:19.159> a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
going to be a d not an e so it's down a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.029 
going to be a d not an e so it's down a
whole<00:01:19.490> step<00:01:19.520> which<00:01:20.119> are<00:01:20.270> usually<00:01:20.450> on<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
whole step which are usually on the

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.730 
whole step which are usually on the
tuning<00:01:22.039> websites<00:01:22.369> as<00:01:22.460> well<00:01:22.930> let's<00:01:23.930> see<00:01:24.140> Center

tune<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.039> drop<00:01:25.159> D<00:01:25.369> tuning<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.880> then<00:01:26.390> when<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
tune in drop D tuning and then when I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.830 
tune in drop D tuning and then when I
say<00:01:27.200> six<00:01:27.860> string<00:01:28.130> 5th<00:01:28.369> string<00:01:28.580> 4th<00:01:28.850> string<00:01:29.210> etc

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
say six string 5th string 4th string etc

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.039 
say six string 5th string 4th string etc
but<00:01:30.320> six<00:01:30.619> five<00:01:30.860> four<00:01:30.890> three<00:01:31.159> two<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.149> then

but six five four three two one and then
when<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.229> talk<00:01:33.500> about<00:01:33.530> frets<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.569> fret<00:01:35.869> one

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
when I talk about frets this is fret one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.809 
when I talk about frets this is fret one
fret<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.890> fret<00:01:37.340> 3<00:01:37.520> fret<00:01:37.940> for<00:01:38.210> etc<00:01:38.869> basically

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.440 
fret to fret 3 fret for etc basically
these<00:01:40.819> lines<00:01:41.210> mark<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> frets<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.759> those<00:01:43.970> 12

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
these lines mark the frets so those 12

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.630 
these lines mark the frets so those 12
and<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.899> say<00:01:45.080> open<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.860> means<00:01:46.069> you<00:01:46.429> don't

first string open you're playing just
the<00:01:58.429> string<00:01:58.670> by<00:01:58.850> itself<00:02:00.340> last<00:02:01.340> thing<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:03.619> do

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the string by itself last thing I we do

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.919 
the string by itself last thing I we do
a<00:02:03.770> lot<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:03.950> power<00:02:04.220> cords<00:02:04.670> if<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.659> don't<00:02:05.840> know

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
a lot of power cords if you don't know

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.630 
a lot of power cords if you don't know
what<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.229> it's<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.799> first<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
what that is it's the first and the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.449 
what that is it's the first and the
fifth<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.269> scale<00:02:08.600> or<00:02:08.929> cord<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.100> fist

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
fifth of a scale or cord or the fist

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.500 
fifth of a scale or cord or the fist
birth<00:02:10.729> fit<00:02:11.620> leather<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.820> first<00:02:14.060> fifth<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
birth fit leather or the first fifth and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.410 
birth fit leather or the first fifth and
the<00:02:14.570> octave<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:16.340> easier<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.299> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the octave it's easier just to do the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.970 
the octave it's easier just to do the
first<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> fifth<00:02:18.019> let's<00:02:18.440> say<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:18.769> on<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
first in the fifth let's say it's on the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.140 
first in the fifth let's say it's on the
sixth<00:02:19.310> string<00:02:19.340> I'm<00:02:20.269> going<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.630> here<00:02:22.150> six

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
sixth string I'm going to do here six

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.960 
sixth string I'm going to do here six
string<00:02:23.480> third<00:02:23.780> fret<00:02:24.070> 5th<00:02:25.070> string<00:02:26.380> fifth<00:02:27.380> fret

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
string third fret 5th string fifth fret

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.180 
string third fret 5th string fifth fret
so<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.959> sixth<00:02:30.230> string<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.859> fifth

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
so if it's on the sixth string the fifth

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.000 
so if it's on the sixth string the fifth
string<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.700> two<00:02:32.230> frets<00:02:33.230> away<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:34.579> that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
string is two frets away you see that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.309 
string is two frets away you see that
and<00:02:36.159> if<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.909> want<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.150> add<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.390> octave<00:02:37.810> just

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
and if you want to add the octave just

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.089 
and if you want to add the octave just
put<00:02:38.590> your<00:02:38.769> pinky<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.450> next<00:02:40.750> string<00:02:41.590> up<00:02:41.829> on

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
put your pinky on the next string up on

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.429 
put your pinky on the next string up on
the<00:02:42.849> same<00:02:43.000> front<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:45.069> it's<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.909> same<00:02:46.060> thing

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
the same front and it's the same thing

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.899 
the same front and it's the same thing
for<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.500> fifth<00:02:48.010> string<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:50.010> power<00:02:51.010> cords<00:02:51.430> only

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
for the fifth string we power cords only

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.440 
for the fifth string we power cords only
work<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.720> some<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> strings<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> there

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
work for some of the strings so so there

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.850 
work for some of the strings so so there
