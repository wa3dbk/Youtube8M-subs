 before we start we put the clams in 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.030
 a bowl with water and salt so that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.540
 release the sand then cut the garlic

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 of hake 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.920

 prawns are frozen test but if not 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.530
 we have had time we will reduce the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.940
 quantity of broth and wine so that 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.940
 sauce is not too liquid 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 the oil and sprinkle with the parsley 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 We programmed the stew menu 14 minutes with 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:51.400
 4 power when the chef plus ends if 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.620

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.260
 liquid add a tablespoon of flour 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.840
 of corn in a moment we will have a 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.910
