there's my attempt at trying to get some
kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.440> water<00:00:14.429> level<00:00:14.790> device<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.750> that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
kind of water level device going so that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.120 
kind of water level device going so that
I<00:00:15.929> will<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:18.410> much<00:00:19.410> longer<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.770> had<00:00:19.980> before

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I will know how much longer I had before

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
I will know how much longer I had before
I<00:00:20.310> ran<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> water<00:00:20.880> being<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I ran out of water being that this is

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.330 
I ran out of water being that this is
wooden<00:00:22.460> it's<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> fabric<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:25.220> gasket<00:00:26.220> I've

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
wooden it's the fabric up gasket I've

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
wooden it's the fabric up gasket I've
got<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:26.990> they<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:29.130> fire<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
got on there they they like fire a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.589 
got on there they they like fire a
little<00:00:29.670> too<00:00:29.789> well<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.240> want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> make<00:00:30.570> sure

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
little too well and I want to make sure

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
little too well and I want to make sure
didn't<00:00:30.929> cause<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> mess<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.669> far

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
didn't cause a mess of the thing as far

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240 
didn't cause a mess of the thing as far
as<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.410> lid<00:00:34.410> right<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.040> made<00:00:35.219> out

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
as the lid right there that's made out

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.380 
as the lid right there that's made out
of<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.870> different<00:00:36.870> sheets<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.200> plywood

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
of two different sheets of plywood

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
of two different sheets of plywood
basically<00:00:39.390> sandwiched<00:00:39.870> together<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> can

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
basically sandwiched together so I can

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
basically sandwiched together so I can
make<00:00:41.489> sure<00:00:41.520> they're<00:00:41.820> good<00:00:42.030> go<00:00:42.180> wandering<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
make sure they're good go wandering on

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680 
make sure they're good go wandering on
me<00:00:43.250> did<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:44.910> thing<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.420> here

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
me did basically the same thing up here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.190 
me did basically the same thing up here
where<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> hose<00:00:47.969> reaches<00:00:48.780> into<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
where the the hose reaches into the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.840 
where the the hose reaches into the
sewer<00:00:49.500> pipe<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> sewer<00:00:50.399> pipe<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
sewer pipe it's a sewer pipe with the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
sewer pipe it's a sewer pipe with the
spacers<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> hold<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> woods

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
spacers in there to hold on to the woods

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
spacers in there to hold on to the woods
keep<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> inside<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> steam<00:00:57.329> stream<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
keep it inside of the steam stream so to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.099 
keep it inside of the steam stream so to
speak<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:59.460> basically<00:00:59.940> another<00:01:00.210> few<00:01:00.510> hunks

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
speak that's basically another few hunks

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.780 
speak that's basically another few hunks
of<00:01:01.230> wood<00:01:01.469> turned<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.420> bit<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> gasket

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to make sure that I didn't pull up the

from own my little shop vacs that died
but<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:29.070> melted<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but I melted that so that was a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.300 
but I melted that so that was a
non-starter<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> idea<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.050> give<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.070> sex

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.000 
to work it out here to the end they

stand out here all day long for the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
second place by long few times in Berlin

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.580 
second place by long few times in Berlin
Langford<00:02:34.370> Neely's<00:02:35.680> next<00:02:36.680> time<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> make<00:02:37.159> a<00:02:37.189> form

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
Langford Neely's next time I make a form

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.190 
Langford Neely's next time I make a form
I'm<00:02:39.590> trying<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.920> sit<00:02:40.099> there<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.340> make<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
I'm trying to sit there and make a

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.929 
I'm trying to sit there and make a
little<00:02:42.200> square<00:02:42.530> bit<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.220> end<00:02:43.340> here<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
little square bit to the end here so

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.199 
little square bit to the end here so
that<00:02:44.659> when<00:02:45.609> we<00:02:46.609> do<00:02:46.760> this

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
that when we do this

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.720 
that when we do this
I<00:02:47.239> have<00:02:47.870> something<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.230> sit<00:02:48.530> there<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:49.370> square

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
I have something to sit there we square

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.520 
I have something to sit there we square
up<00:02:49.760> against<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.159> curve<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:53.409> easier<00:02:54.409> to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
up against so this curve is easier to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.679 
up against so this curve is easier to
make<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.640> barely<00:02:55.879> holding<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.420> over

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
make this is just barely holding on over

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.819 
make this is just barely holding on over
here<00:02:58.659> same<00:02:59.659> for<00:02:59.840> this<00:02:59.930> end<00:03:00.940> don't<00:03:01.940> break<00:03:02.829> don't

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
here same for this end don't break don't

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:28.120 
here same for this end don't break don't
break<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.400> nice<00:03:04.909> to<00:03:05.090> break

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.070 

basically

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
basically

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.830 
basically
once<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.770> get<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> finish<00:03:32.580> with<00:03:33.000> these

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
once you get to the finish with these

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.140 
once you get to the finish with these
things<00:03:34.370> cool

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.960

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.000 

these<00:03:43.970> things<00:03:44.270> will<00:03:44.450> maintain<00:03:44.810> my<00:03:45.019> shape<00:03:48.010> kind

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
these things will maintain my shape kind

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.500 
these things will maintain my shape kind
