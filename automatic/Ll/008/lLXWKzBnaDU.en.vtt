00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.120
 there is no such image 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.220
 good so far at a glance 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.620
 I think that as many hubs as targets 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.900
 only boxes can with the tip of the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.119
 repetition of the left hand just of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.849
 our after the hand there are the 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.640
 fingers being a macro artist is only the 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.940
 start of humans without being stepped on 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.850
 the fingers now has three centimeters 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.360
 of finger is a saying also not 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.420
 it's quieter 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 the best thing was where all the two for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.600
 back then in fact a bit but 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 fracture 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 the images seem to have lost to 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:01:00.030
 hand when he came to the people of the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.610
 clinic the light that was found in your already 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 it was but good the thing is that this 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.890
 is calmer Alejandra Gordillo 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.300
 like what there is that what there is that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.670
 To consider is that at this point and at 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 December 17 finish competing without 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 stop at a very long time then the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.780
 ferris wheel there is a stress issue also of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 tiredness pressure that is played in 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920
 against not also now what a shame because 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.080
 Alejandra had been accumulating enough 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.910
 points quite scores in this first 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.369
 test and knowing that they will receive a 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.320
 very big prize at the end of the week 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.790
 pitifully bet of bullseye to the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.009
 moment he turned that situation around 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.020
 and together with mario hart what has a 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.790
 highest score so far at 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 margin of the issue of the sentence because 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.950
 one of those sentenced 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.710
 after partying it would only be 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 combat 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.460
 good is a little bit to numb 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.729
 the example that they would have to 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.729
 little bit of guano and water a bit of desire 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.569
 that car pizza 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.930
 it gets big the alejandra wagons 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.019
 today we have the best hole is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.569
 Alejandra and we are going to a cut 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.950
 commercial and it came a lot more because this 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 It's combat, we've come
