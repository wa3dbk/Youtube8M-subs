from<00:01:31.350> 5<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.189> optional<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
from 5 actually I think it's optional so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.620 
from 5 actually I think it's optional so
it's<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> bad

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's not that bad

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's not that bad

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
assumed it all the way out so it looks

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.890 
assumed it all the way out so it looks
not<00:03:38.260> as<00:03:38.379> terrible<00:03:38.909> but<00:03:39.909> like<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.209> had<00:03:40.389> 609

not as terrible but like I had 609
gigabytes<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.129> end<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.489> last<00:03:42.639> video

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
gigabytes at the end of the last video

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.189 
gigabytes at the end of the last video
and<00:03:43.299> then<00:03:43.739> I've<00:03:44.739> 692<00:03:45.549> now<00:03:45.759> and<00:03:46.180> that's<00:03:46.569> after<00:03:46.780> I

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
and then I've 692 now and that's after I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.580 
and then I've 692 now and that's after I
uh<00:03:48.629> that's<00:03:49.629> after<00:03:49.959> all<00:03:50.079> right<00:03:50.199> and<00:03:50.319> I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
uh that's after all right and I

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.420 
uh that's after all right and I
installed<00:03:51.040> mass<00:03:51.250> spec<00:03:51.430> 2<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:51.699> 3<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:51.909> basically

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
installed mass spec 2 and 3 so basically

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.830 
installed mass spec 2 and 3 so basically
that<00:03:54.430> would<00:03:54.579> have<00:03:54.669> been<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:54.909> over<00:03:55.120> 700

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
that would have been like over 700

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.449 
that would have been like over 700
gigabytes<00:03:56.229> because<00:03:56.530> these<00:03:56.680> were<00:03:56.829> like<00:03:56.979> at

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
gigabytes because these were like at

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.469 
gigabytes because these were like at
least<00:03:57.729> twelve<00:03:57.970> gigabytes

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
least twelve gigabytes

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.929 
least twelve gigabytes
each<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.019> think<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.709> download<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.340> really<00:04:00.849> like

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
each I think to download I really like

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.009 
each I think to download I really like
close<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.359> was<00:04:01.449> like<00:04:01.569> 20<00:04:01.750> gigabytes

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
close to that I was like 20 gigabytes

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.599 
close to that I was like 20 gigabytes
for<00:04:02.199> those<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.009> that<00:04:03.040> would<00:04:03.220> have<00:04:03.310> put<00:04:03.430> me<00:04:03.519> at

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
for those so that would have put me at

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.289 
for those so that would have put me at
700<00:04:04.389> gigabytes<00:04:04.780> for<00:04:05.229> the<00:04:06.180> terabyte<00:04:07.180> high

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
700 gigabytes for the terabyte high

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.569 
700 gigabytes for the terabyte high
drive<00:04:07.479> I<00:04:07.569> put<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.959> after<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.769> deleted<00:04:09.310> all<00:04:09.430> that

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
drive I put in after I deleted all that

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.729 
drive I put in after I deleted all that
stuff<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.269> had<00:04:10.780> copied<00:04:11.199> everything<00:04:11.590> over

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
stuff and had copied everything over

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.550 
stuff and had copied everything over
from<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.979> old<00:04:12.009> ps3<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:12.819> basically<00:04:13.439> so<00:04:14.439> yeah

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
from the old ps3 so basically so yeah

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.020 
from the old ps3 so basically so yeah
I'm<00:04:14.650> almost<00:04:14.859> at<00:04:15.009> 700<00:04:15.400> gigabytes<00:04:15.699> now<00:04:15.849> so

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
I'm almost at 700 gigabytes now so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.729 
I'm almost at 700 gigabytes now so
basically<00:04:16.150> I'm<00:04:16.479> at<00:04:16.659> way<00:04:16.840> more<00:04:17.049> one<00:04:17.470> out<00:04:17.590> way

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
basically I'm at way more one out way

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.000 
basically I'm at way more one out way
more<00:04:17.919> but<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.430> lot<00:04:19.030> more<00:04:19.239> space<00:04:19.479> then<00:04:20.169> I<00:04:20.500> was<00:04:20.799> at

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
more but a lot more space then I was at

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.500 
more but a lot more space then I was at
the<00:04:21.310> end<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.609> last<00:04:21.760> video<00:04:21.940> where<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.360> had

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
the end of the last video where I had

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.629 
the end of the last video where I had
609

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
609

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.149 
609
like<00:04:24.819> dipping<00:04:25.599> into<00:04:25.780> 500<00:04:26.289> range<00:04:26.469> now<00:04:26.860> I'm<00:04:26.979> at

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
like dipping into 500 range now I'm at

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.339 
like dipping into 500 range now I'm at
almost<00:04:27.909> 700<00:04:28.389> gigabytes<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:29.050> that's<00:04:29.199> pretty

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
almost 700 gigabytes so that's pretty

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.800 
almost 700 gigabytes so that's pretty
good<00:04:29.639> that's<00:04:30.639> basically<00:04:30.999> it<00:04:31.300> for<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.569> video<00:04:31.659> I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
necessary for you to have to play games

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.540 
necessary for you to have to play games
that<00:04:43.210> are<00:04:43.360> on<00:04:43.479> your<00:04:44.009> PS<00:04:45.009> tricks<00:04:45.219> down<00:04:45.310> here<00:04:45.520> I

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
that are on your PS tricks down here I

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.610 
that are on your PS tricks down here I
have<00:04:45.879> Mass<00:04:46.659> Effect<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.319> little<00:04:47.499> big<00:04:47.590> planet

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
have Mass Effect and a little big planet

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.040 
have Mass Effect and a little big planet
so<00:04:48.340> that's<00:04:48.999> why<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.150> installs<00:04:49.539> on<00:04:49.719> there

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
so that's why that installs on there

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.969 
so that's why that installs on there
so<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.370> here<00:04:51.490> somewhere<00:04:52.770> somewhere<00:04:53.770> it

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
so it's in here somewhere somewhere it

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.189 
so it's in here somewhere somewhere it
should<00:04:54.159> be<00:04:54.249> and<00:04:55.150> here's<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> work<00:04:55.539> there<00:04:56.110> it

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
should be and here's the work there it

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.469 
should be and here's the work there it
is<00:04:56.289> literally<00:04:56.590> planets<00:04:56.949> yeah<00:04:57.270> that's<00:04:58.270> why

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
is literally planets yeah that's why

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.279 
is literally planets yeah that's why
that's<00:04:58.750> there<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:01.479> all<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.689> other<00:05:01.750> PSN<00:05:02.259> games

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
that's there and all the other PSN games

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.899 
that's there and all the other PSN games
so<00:05:02.949> yeah<00:05:04.710> yeah<00:05:05.710> I<00:05:05.740> forgot<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.520> show<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.699> last

yeah that's where the video and like I
said<00:05:14.229> they<00:05:14.560> everything<00:05:14.800> in<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:14.949> game<00:05:15.069> data

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
said they everything in the game data

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.829 
said they everything in the game data
utility<00:05:15.759> that<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.120> don't<00:05:16.360> need<00:05:16.479> cuz<00:05:16.750> it'll

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:16.839 
utility that you don't need cuz it'll

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.079 
utility that you don't need cuz it'll
give<00:05:17.349> you<00:05:17.439> more<00:05:17.469> space<00:05:17.800> my<00:05:18.550> case<00:05:18.759> is<00:05:18.879> almost

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.089 
give you more space my case is almost

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.350 
give you more space my case is almost
energy<00:05:19.449> or<00:05:19.689> probably<00:05:20.789> 100<00:05:21.789> if<00:05:21.939> not<00:05:22.120> more<00:05:22.270> than

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
energy or probably 100 if not more than

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.790 
energy or probably 100 if not more than
hundred<00:05:22.629> good<00:05:22.779> bytes<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.199> that's<00:05:23.349> a<00:05:23.409> lot<00:05:23.710> of

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
hundred good bytes so that's a lot of

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.050 
hundred good bytes so that's a lot of
space<00:05:24.009> that's<00:05:24.729> like<00:05:24.909> one<00:05:25.830> one<00:05:26.830> tenth<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.849> my

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
space that's like one one tenth of my

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.429 
space that's like one one tenth of my
hard<00:05:28.240> drive<00:05:28.360> size<00:05:28.569> if<00:05:28.960> it's<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:29.229> good<00:05:29.349> 2

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
hard drive size if it's a good 2

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.610 
hard drive size if it's a good 2
terabytes<00:05:29.830> oh<00:05:29.979> yeah<00:05:30.129> that's<00:05:30.339> lost<00:05:30.490> 10%<00:05:31.029> so
