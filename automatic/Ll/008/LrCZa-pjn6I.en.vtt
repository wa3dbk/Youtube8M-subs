00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello computers clan members is here 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.200
 Europe and I enter you today 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.980
 tutorial about swine riders attacking in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 cw 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 because since the update there are certain 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.769
 problems the first problem is the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 she makes these bombs since the update 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.039
 150 percent more harm to pigs 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.140
 lancers 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 this can make sure the pigs 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.600
 Rider at a stroke all history 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.829
 are also new as are the heroes 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.129
 defend now 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 they only stay with their storage in one 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.059
 very small radius and defend 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 no longer the whole base as soon as you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.100
 alarmed are much more likely to see that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.079
 Question mark 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.010
 and he later exclaims when 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.570
 the units come close for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 However, the cd attack plays this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 no big role because of the defense 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.730
 strength has become much lower 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.690
 therefore you can practically ignore them 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.519
 summarized can be said so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.250
 that the giants bomb the main problem 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 therefore it is inevitable that we 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.950
 Reasonably play the base around 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.350
 if necessary, the smell of soil is double 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 see or so to suspect 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.420
 for example, in such empty places 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.790
 There it is very possible that two 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.890
 giant chunks next to each other are what 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.030
 all pigs most likely 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.400
 a blow again slaughters stand so 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.240
 is that the court if it still is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.460
 a pig rider wanted to attack 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.530
 Let's look at an opponent where one 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.530
 Snatch attack comes into question 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 Everything is pretty tight at this base 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.310
 Although blank space sees the area of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.280
 a giant bomb is twice two 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.790
 But on the other hand, that's tinkering too 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.460
 the area of teslas he would me there 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 on teslas suspect and not on giants 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 Bomb to show you like a time 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.610
 attack because of that can fail show 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.290
 I attack you this anonymous here 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.519
 and I do not want to say who from there 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.170
 is not to show that 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.090
 of course he first tries the cd 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.090
 he does not quite succeed in luring it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.610
 always try one now are the bubis 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.620
 off 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.830
 as he may already see up there 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.650
 where the mouse is straight could be two 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.780
 I would guess so 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.190
 and we'll see if it works 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.530
 so is allowed to continue the cb movies 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.140
 come out but it can not 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.410
 have been 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.310
 25 units fit in 10 15 he has 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.070
 So far, you blocked as you know 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.470
 pig intervention is that arno dcb too 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.230
 learn so now he thinks well 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.060
 apparently he has them all out and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 send all pigs at once 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.220
 purely as they come unfortunately they are there 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.989
 Still magician in the cb would be the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.329
 Swine kill already but there they are 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.670
 They are huge bombs and they hit you 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.030
 all gone and there brings the healing magic 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.730
 nothing more so either way 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.709
 That's why he lost the big ones 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.790
 bomb and just these double giants 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.620
 bombs are too big a danger 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.030
 so in the end I'll show you one more 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.560
 Attack where the pigs strategy 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.370
 has worked as usual, the cd 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.150
 I've always lured the pigs here 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.189
 offset offset whether the cp offset 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.239
 lure around at the same time the giant 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.680
 activate bombs 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.180
 with a giant bomb it is even me 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:07.370
 education so I turn the usual 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:09.470
 For example, after you turn off that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.590
 I will send in the span and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.209
 they will go their own way 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.109
 as a small background info if you have the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.000
 For example, one attracts a rule or practical 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.759
 always the weak come first 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.949
 units out and then the stronger ones 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.080
 Here you have the Valkyrie last 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.509
 seen what makes the strongest unit 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.930
 and I knew that too, I saw it too 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.789
 that no further units came out 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.650
 you can see very well that the king 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.479
 as I said actually not big role 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.340
 play 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.510
 12 pigs children perhaps but 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.789
 it is rather weak 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.680
 the defense of the essential 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:51.289
 weaker than conclusion I can tell you 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.740
 Swine attacks should be very much 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.789
 Enjoy now with caution 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.760
 because of the story with the giants 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:01.220
 bombs it is a very very risky 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.340
 The pigs got attacked 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.669
 a blow can all be gone so 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.479
 therefore, I would generally like that 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.789
 advise against 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.380
 unless you have a base where you are 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.810
 it is pretty sure that this attack 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.180
 the swine rider works 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.430
 Strategy becomes successful for civil 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.490
 attacks no longer play a major role 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.830
 the future is being attacked from the 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.880
 air with kites or balloons lie 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.599
 or the gww or one 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.550
 simple huge attack report 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:38.949
 I hope it helped you and you 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.949
 Conclusion drawn from it
