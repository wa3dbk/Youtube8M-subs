why<00:00:01.560> chase<00:00:01.829> has<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> new<00:00:02.280> GUI<00:00:02.669> now<00:00:02.939> so<00:00:03.360> let's

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
why chase has a new GUI now so let's

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:12.620 
why chase has a new GUI now so let's
check<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:03.990> one<00:00:04.350> out<00:00:07.519> let's<00:00:08.519> see<00:00:08.730> here<00:00:11.630> all

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
check that one out let's see here all

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870 
check that one out let's see here all
right<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> new<00:00:13.620> GUI<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.340> it's

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
right so this is the new GUI and it's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
right so this is the new GUI and it's
much<00:00:15.030> more<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.049> guess<00:00:16.379> more<00:00:16.800> simplified

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
much more like I guess more simplified

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.179 
much more like I guess more simplified
with<00:00:17.609> categories<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.890> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
with categories and all that so you can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.880 
with categories and all that so you can
see<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.630> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> stall<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> nap<00:00:22.289> benchmark

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
see that you can stall a nap benchmark

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700 
see that you can stall a nap benchmark

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.710 

and<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.810> games<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> new<00:01:10.040> one

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
and the games here this is the new one

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.420 
and the games here this is the new one
it<00:01:11.720> was<00:01:11.840> actually<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:12.170> separate<00:01:12.560> project<00:01:12.800> it

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
it was actually a separate project it

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.330 
it was actually a separate project it
was<00:01:13.580> called<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:13.910> wind<00:01:14.390> cyl<00:01:14.600> tool<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.340> mainly

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
was called the wind cyl tool and mainly

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.050 
was called the wind cyl tool and mainly
it<00:01:16.490> was<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.240> install<00:01:17.630> games<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.910> now

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
it was just to install games but now

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.540 
it was just to install games but now
they<00:01:20.270> merge<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.900> into<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:21.500> wine<00:01:21.830> tricks<00:01:22.250> and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
they merge it into just wine tricks and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.040 
they merge it into just wine tricks and
it<00:01:22.760> makes<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.060> lot<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.240> sense<00:01:23.360> instead<00:01:23.930> of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
it makes a lot of sense instead of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.260 
it makes a lot of sense instead of
having<00:01:24.230> two<00:01:24.560> separate<00:01:24.890> project<00:01:25.370> they<00:01:26.120> can

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
having two separate project they can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750 
having two separate project they can
just<00:01:26.480> put<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:26.780> into<00:01:26.990> one<00:01:27.290> okay<00:01:27.830> so<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:28.670> you

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
just put it into one okay so if you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.560 
just put it into one okay so if you
install<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.150> game<00:01:30.820> mainly<00:01:31.820> it's<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:32.090> demos

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570

let's go cancel that so that was the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.430 
let's go cancel that so that was the
wind<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.320> tool<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> games<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:11.540> now<00:02:12.170> they

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
wind so tool for the games and now they

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.710 
wind so tool for the games and now they
have<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.860> thing<00:02:13.040> called<00:02:13.070> like<00:02:13.640> your<00:02:14.330> default

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
have this thing called like your default

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.140 
have this thing called like your default
wine<00:02:14.900> prefix<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:16.250> kind<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.670> doesn't<00:02:16.850> make

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
wine prefix it kind of doesn't make

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.640 
wine prefix it kind of doesn't make
sense<00:02:17.390> when<00:02:17.690> they<00:02:17.840> named<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.500> this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
sense when they named it like this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.140 
sense when they named it like this
because<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.040> can't<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.459> select<00:02:20.000> your

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
because you can't really select your

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.080 
because you can't really select your
default<00:02:20.959> or<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.920> can't<00:02:22.130> change<00:02:22.370> your<00:02:22.519> you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
default or you can't change your you

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.350 
default or you can't change your you
know<00:02:23.120> your<00:02:23.239> wine<00:02:23.570> prefix<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.150> don't<00:02:26.300> know

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
know your wine prefix if you don't know

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.509 
know your wine prefix if you don't know
what<00:02:26.480> wine<00:02:26.690> prefixes<00:02:27.440> let<00:02:27.739> me<00:02:27.890> give<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.250> an

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
what wine prefixes let me give you an

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.250 
what wine prefixes let me give you an
example<00:02:28.850> here<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:31.550> default<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:32.300> my

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
example here so my default one my

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.580 
example here so my default one my
default<00:02:33.709> wine<00:02:33.890> prefix<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:35.570> folder<00:02:36.050> okay

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
default wine prefix is this folder okay

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.130 
default wine prefix is this folder okay
a<00:02:36.799> dot<00:02:37.459> wine<00:02:37.730> folder<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.930> have

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
a dot wine folder now you can have

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.880 
a dot wine folder now you can have
multiple<00:02:39.640> folders<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:41.030> wine<00:02:41.299> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
multiple folders of wine and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
multiple folders of wine and
some<00:02:43.890> people<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:45.180> know<00:02:45.300> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
some people do that like I know it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.010 
some people do that like I know it's
adega<00:02:46.020> they<00:02:46.200> call<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.560> wine<00:02:46.890> bottles<00:02:47.460> and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
adega they call it wine bottles and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.700 
adega they call it wine bottles and
basically<00:02:49.460> one<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.810> why<00:02:52.020> prefix<00:02:52.530> does

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
basically one you know why prefix does

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.040 
basically one you know why prefix does
not<00:02:52.890> affect<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> other<00:02:53.600> because<00:02:54.600> when<00:02:54.900> you're

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
not affect the other because when you're

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.620 
not affect the other because when you're
doing<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.440> some<00:02:56.070> tweaking<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.640> whatever<00:02:56.910> it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
doing like some tweaking or whatever it

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.810 
doing like some tweaking or whatever it
might<00:02:57.810> mess<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.620> other<00:02:58.830> games<00:02:59.430> or<00:02:59.640> other

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
might mess up the other games or other

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.430 
might mess up the other games or other
programs<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.750> that's<00:03:00.959> why<00:03:01.110> they<00:03:01.260> have

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
programs so that's why they have

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920 
programs so that's why they have
different<00:03:01.800> folders<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:03.360> certain

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
different folders for a certain

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.250 
different folders for a certain
application<00:03:04.590> or<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.740> game<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:06.690> was<00:03:06.750> like

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
application or a game and that was like

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.430 
application or a game and that was like
their<00:03:07.560> method<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> even<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.209> even<00:03:09.540> play

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
their method and even I think even play

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.260 
their method and even I think even play
on<00:03:10.620> Linux<00:03:10.950> does<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.340> too<00:03:11.550> they<00:03:12.090> have

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
on Linux does this too they have

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.229 
on Linux does this too they have
different<00:03:12.570> wine<00:03:13.200> prefix<00:03:13.800> for<00:03:14.730> everything<00:03:15.120> you

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
different wine prefix for everything you

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.140 
different wine prefix for everything you
install<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.280> here<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.670> says<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.000> can

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
install but in here it says you can

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.390 
install but in here it says you can
change<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.080> different<00:03:19.380> wine<00:03:19.680> prefix<00:03:20.130> but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
change it to a different wine prefix but

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.860 
change it to a different wine prefix but
I<00:03:20.430> didn't<00:03:20.640> really<00:03:20.670> see<00:03:20.850> any<00:03:21.209> settings<00:03:21.660> that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
I didn't really see any settings that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.050 
I didn't really see any settings that
you<00:03:21.900> can<00:03:21.989> change<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.709> okay<00:03:23.100> you're<00:03:23.670> just<00:03:23.790> using

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you can change it okay you're just using

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.090 
you can change it okay you're just using
one<00:03:24.209> only<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.590> change<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
one only here and you can change the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.250 
one only here and you can change the
settings<00:03:26.430> within<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.090> default<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.140> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
settings within that default that you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.330 
settings within that default that you
have<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.489> wine<00:03:29.850> folder<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:32.010> let's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
have which is this wine folder but let's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.430 
have which is this wine folder but let's
see<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.480> install<00:03:33.750> some<00:03:33.989> missing

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
see here so you can install some missing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.979 
see here so you can install some missing
dll<00:03:34.920> components<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.420> mainly<00:03:36.660> you

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
dll components this is mainly you

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.780 
dll components this is mainly you
installed<00:03:37.350> games<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.070> use<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.550> one<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
installed games then you use this one a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.170 
installed games then you use this one a
lot<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.020> have

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.599 

so<00:03:43.989> something<00:03:44.319> that's<00:03:44.500> new<00:03:44.799> here<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.129> believe

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
so something that's new here I believe

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.209 
so something that's new here I believe
this<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:45.969> new<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.510> check<00:03:46.750> boxes<00:03:47.319> is

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.219 
this is new the check boxes is

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.929 
this is new the check boxes is
highlighted<00:03:48.969> okay<00:03:49.359> before<00:03:50.280> even<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.760> have

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
highlighted okay before even if you have

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.089 
highlighted okay before even if you have
it<00:03:52.120> installed<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.780> was<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.319> highlighted<00:03:53.890> so

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
it installed it was not highlighted so

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.679 
it installed it was not highlighted so
you<00:03:54.159> can<00:03:54.310> see<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.459> now<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:55.090> highlight<00:03:55.510> all

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
you can see that now they highlight all

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.649 
you can see that now they highlight all
the<00:03:55.719> ones<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.109> i<00:03:56.170> have<00:03:56.379> installed<00:03:56.890> already

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
the ones that i have installed already

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.360 
the ones that i have installed already
so<00:03:58.659> all<00:03:58.689> this<00:03:58.989> dll<00:03:59.859> crap<00:04:00.159> that<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:01.349> right

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
so all this dll crap that I have right

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
so all this dll crap that I have right
it<00:04:03.370> doesn't<00:04:03.700> mean<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:03.969> you<00:04:04.120> uncheck<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.780> that

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
it doesn't mean that you uncheck it that

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.660 
it doesn't mean that you uncheck it that
means<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.290> uninstall<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.799> no<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.340> doesn't

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
means you uninstall it no it doesn't

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.069 
means you uninstall it no it doesn't
mean<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:07.000> one<00:04:07.180> okay<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.689> just<00:04:07.870> highlights

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
mean that one okay it just highlights

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.809 
mean that one okay it just highlights
the<00:04:08.379> one<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.709> have<00:04:08.859> installed<00:04:09.129> you

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
the one that you have installed you

you<00:05:01.250> know<00:05:01.400> edit<00:05:01.940> here<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:03.080> sometimes<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:03.770> to

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
you know edit here you sometimes have to

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.190 
you know edit here you sometimes have to
use<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.340> if<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:05.210> know<00:05:05.390> your<00:05:05.810> game<00:05:06.080> is

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
use this to if you know your game is

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.170 
use this to if you know your game is
done<00:05:06.380> some<00:05:06.560> run<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.430> did<00:05:07.460> this<00:05:07.760> one<00:05:07.970> for

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
done some run like I did this one for

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.430 
done some run like I did this one for
Assassin's<00:05:08.930> Creed<00:05:09.200> I<00:05:09.230> guess<00:05:11.170> so<00:05:12.170> there<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.350> go

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
Assassin's Creed I guess so there you go

Assassin's Creed I guess so there you go
that's<00:05:13.280> that<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.920> let's<00:05:16.070> go<00:05:16.190> back<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.880> that's

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that's that so let's go back and that's

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.730 
that's that so let's go back and that's
all<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.330> really<00:05:17.510> got<00:05:17.840> these<00:05:18.050> other<00:05:18.230> things<00:05:18.470> just

properties<00:06:28.450> a<00:06:29.130> lot<00:06:30.130> executing<00:06:31.200> pretty<00:06:32.200> much

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
properties a lot executing pretty much

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.880 
properties a lot executing pretty much
that's<00:06:32.620> it<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:34.410> saw<00:06:35.410> you<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:35.590> you're<00:06:35.770> running

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
that's it I saw you and you're running

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.750 
that's it I saw you and you're running
now<00:06:36.220> say<00:06:36.970> running<00:06:37.419> terminal<00:06:37.870> or<00:06:38.200> just<00:06:38.650> run<00:06:38.919> you

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
now say running terminal or just run you

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.290 
now say running terminal or just run you
run<00:06:39.970> in<00:06:40.090> terminal<00:06:40.919> and<00:06:41.919> should<00:06:42.880> pop<00:06:43.090> it<00:06:43.240> the

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
run in terminal and should pop it the

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.450 
run in terminal and should pop it the
same<00:06:43.510> thing<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.810> I<00:06:43.870> show<00:06:44.140> you<00:06:44.200> earlier<00:06:44.830> right

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
same thing that I show you earlier right

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.290 
same thing that I show you earlier right
you<00:06:46.300> know<00:06:46.419> all<00:06:46.570> this<00:06:46.720> stuff<00:06:46.870> here<00:06:47.290> so<00:06:48.300> that's

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
you know all this stuff here so that's

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.580 
you know all this stuff here so that's
how<00:06:49.450> that<00:06:49.510> works<00:06:49.690> if<00:06:50.080> you're<00:06:50.200> going<00:06:50.290> to<00:06:50.380> do<00:06:50.470> it

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
how that works if you're going to do it

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.690 
how that works if you're going to do it
manually<00:06:51.000> but<00:06:52.350> what<00:06:53.350> I<00:06:53.560> would<00:06:53.680> recommend<00:06:53.950> is

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
manually but what I would recommend is

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.010 
manually but what I would recommend is
that<00:06:54.790> you<00:06:55.210> have<00:06:55.600> a<00:06:56.100> in<00:06:57.100> on<00:06:57.220> alias<00:06:57.760> for<00:06:58.000> it<00:06:58.120> so

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
that you have a in on alias for it so

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.510 
that you have a in on alias for it so
was<00:06:59.229> it<00:06:59.380> color<00:06:59.590> learning<00:07:00.010> tricks

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.060 

so<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.550> have<00:07:03.790> like<00:07:04.060> two<00:07:04.330> aliases<00:07:04.930> for<00:07:04.960> it<00:07:05.320> so<00:07:05.710> one

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
so I have like two aliases for it so one

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.660 
so I have like two aliases for it so one
is<00:07:06.280> just<00:07:06.550> you<00:07:07.000> know<00:07:07.120> where<00:07:07.420> my<00:07:07.450> wine<00:07:08.080> tricks<00:07:08.440> is

then download it again right and I give
you<00:07:39.550> permissions<00:07:41.040> and<00:07:42.040> that's<00:07:42.280> it<00:07:42.490> that's<00:07:42.760> how

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970 
you permissions and that's it that's how

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.050 
you permissions and that's it that's how
I<00:07:43.030> would<00:07:43.330> run<00:07:43.870> it<00:07:44.110> if<00:07:44.980> I<00:07:45.160> need<00:07:45.340> a<00:07:45.370> new<00:07:45.640> version

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
I would run it if I need a new version

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.230 
I would run it if I need a new version
it's<00:07:46.870> much<00:07:47.050> better<00:07:47.230> this<00:07:47.680> way<00:07:47.920> because<00:07:48.240> you

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 
it's much better this way because you

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.150 
it's much better this way because you
know<00:07:49.360> that<00:07:49.600> the<00:07:49.780> bun<00:07:50.020> 21<00:07:50.470> they<00:07:50.830> don't<00:07:51.010> always

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160 
know that the bun 21 they don't always

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.430 
know that the bun 21 they don't always
update<00:07:51.700> like<00:07:52.320> the<00:07:53.320> wine<00:07:53.590> tricks<00:07:55.200> script<00:07:56.200> and

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 
update like the wine tricks script and

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.070 
update like the wine tricks script and
if<00:07:57.160> you<00:07:57.280> do<00:07:57.430> this<00:07:57.640> way<00:07:57.850> is<00:07:58.150> from<00:07:58.570> the<00:07:58.690> guy<00:07:58.840> damn

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 
if you do this way is from the guy damn

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.860 
if you do this way is from the guy damn
that<00:07:59.380> actually<00:07:59.500> made<00:07:59.860> it<00:08:00.150> and<00:08:01.150> it<00:08:01.450> does<00:08:01.600> work

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:01.870 
that actually made it and it does work

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.050 
that actually made it and it does work
for<00:08:01.900> like<00:08:02.230> you<00:08:02.920> know<00:08:02.950> all<00:08:03.220> the<00:08:03.400> distributions

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.060 
for like you know all the distributions

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.180 
for like you know all the distributions
instead<00:08:04.840> of<00:08:04.960> just<00:08:05.110> going<00:08:05.290> to<00:08:05.740> launch<00:08:05.920> pad

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.190 
instead of just going to launch pad

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.780 
instead of just going to launch pad
that's<00:08:06.340> only<00:08:06.580> connected<00:08:07.090> to<00:08:07.240> a<00:08:07.600> boon<00:08:07.990> to<00:08:08.020> base

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:08.790 
that's only connected to a boon to base

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.980 
that's only connected to a boon to base
so<00:08:09.790> I'll<00:08:09.910> do<00:08:10.060> something<00:08:10.270> like<00:08:10.450> that<00:08:10.630> if<00:08:10.840> you

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:10.990 
so I'll do something like that if you

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.700 
so I'll do something like that if you
want<00:08:11.380> it<00:08:11.560> that's<00:08:11.740> it<00:08:12.250> for<00:08:12.400> this<00:08:12.490> one
