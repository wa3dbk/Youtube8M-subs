00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello people smiling again now I am 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.379
 coming back to the ship just showing 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 you 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:18.260
 the beauty of this counterfeit Mexico that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.260
 I came today 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.490
 So these guys like my little tooth 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.410
 there is no one to pass that there is no 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.660
 novelty home that has everywhere 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.930
 the staff does not have the dick face that I 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.250
 I have to talk to Paul because 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.050
 actually I did not take any type 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.610
 with you 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 but if you had here looking at me 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 I was talking to him. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.890
 It's crazy for everything. It's good to come here. 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 also 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.020
 bye man 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 but here in my opinion it goes to 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.020
 round this deal 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.160
 and there are people who have people they do not like 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.070
 that I record he knows why he is 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.170
 fled on foot is not talking about being in the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.240
 The place is with the other one talking to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.580
 wife who was working with and tac 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 that's why in a business that the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 degree of turning face 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 the last and only reason I think 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.890
 Because I got cracking and I'm cracking. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.040
 walking only whoever finds the address is neither 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.860
 I do not owe it to anyone 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.860
 I should think straight, my heart team. 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.150
 business is fun life is very 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.710
 short to get bitter understood to 10 mm 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.490
 made fun of in a business and 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.490
 amuse 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 Okay, so you 're going to get on the ship because 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.560
 they can not enter this business 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.970
 the emigration that has passed the day 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.130
