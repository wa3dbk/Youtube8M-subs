00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.340
 I am 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.340
 but the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.770
 at 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.499
 lionel bosco to hold up from 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.029
 charleroi tonight how could that have been 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.399
 arrive 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:53.229
 well how hard it is to say 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.219
 true that in the second half we have not 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.629
 as well played as in the first half 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:59.499
 of course we did not move anymore 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.259
 was too static 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.860
 so I think it was that the 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.399
 Mistakes we strong 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.749
 second half time 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:06.459
 now we're going it's true that 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:11.139
 first half we have created 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:13.719
 a nice collective basketball that's it 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.209
 difficult to explain the hold up with 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.069
 walsh matt putting two actions 

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:20.080
 finish with 1.2 plus is three 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.639
 peppers from nowhere so we have the 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.499
 deserved for him too 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.669
 let's go back to this end of the game even though 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.439
 the return of charleroi is done during 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.999
 the whole second period but you tell us 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.969
 explain why matt walsh has so much 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.649
 the space on the last possession 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.569
 Well, I do not know, I'm trying to do 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.629
 complete dinner on this big dole for no 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.279
 not that he's the one with the ball 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.039
 it was dre I think they were on 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.909
 defending him 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.559
 maybe a line of iron says nein 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.209
 maximum also to prevent him from 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.589
 receive the ball 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:49.749
 now here it is true that it leaves 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.309
 a little bit alone at three points he 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.419
 must also say that they whisper to a 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.009
 meter of the three point line so 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.079
 it was difficult too for play dray 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.999
 in defense against him you played tonight 

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:58.930
 against randle it is rare that you play 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.209
 against a million size 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.189
 is it easier for you my no because 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:05.050
 that he is fast he is very fast he 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.519
 a change of direction who is who 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.409
 and that is very important too so 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:09.669
 that's been a tough match for 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.039
 I took turns with geoffrey 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.990
 adjustments to defend on him has the 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.519
 better possible 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.509
 here we knew he and walsh he 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.699
 was going to score their points 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.529
 we had to try to limit the others 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.360
 good sacha massot put some 3 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.129
 points so here we have not filled well 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.129
 our the sni flew messi lyonnais 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.880
 months already
