piston doorway Gorillaz 24 sorry if I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.610 
piston doorway Gorillaz 24 sorry if I
didn't<00:00:10.830> pronounce<00:00:10.980> your<00:00:11.280> name<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
didn't pronounce your name right but the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.240 
didn't pronounce your name right but the
best<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.030> he<00:00:15.030> asked<00:00:15.360> me<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.780> make<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> lock<00:00:16.949> so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
best I got he asked me to make a lock so

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
best I got he asked me to make a lock so
that<00:00:18.020> mobs<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:21.300> house<00:00:22.039> so

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that mobs don't get in to your house so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.320 
that mobs don't get in to your house so
I<00:00:23.070> did<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:23.789> testing<00:00:24.300> right<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.960> i<00:00:26.330> have

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I did some testing right here and i have

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.859 
I did some testing right here and i have
figured<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> i'm<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.599> show<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
figured it out so i'm going to show you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.720 
figured it out so i'm going to show you
how<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> build<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:34.340> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.520> bit

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
how to build that right now it's a bit

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.299 
how to build that right now it's a bit
different<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> other<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.070> here<00:00:38.070> we

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
different from the other one here we

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.639 
different from the other one here we
build<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:40.460> crunch<00:00:41.460> 40<00:00:42.239> oops<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.399> one<00:00:44.399> more

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
build a crunch 40 oops that's one more

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:56.600 
build a crunch 40 oops that's one more
and<00:00:48.469> six<00:00:49.469> white<00:00:53.329> just<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.610> then

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and six white just like that and then

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
and six white just like that and then
they<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.270> these<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.410> blocks<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.010> either<00:00:59.250> side

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they got these two blocks on either side

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.840 
they got these two blocks on either side
and<00:01:00.199> place<00:01:01.199> torches<00:01:05.420> like<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and place torches like so now we go to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.010 
and place torches like so now we go to
this<00:01:11.850> side<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:13.700> tell<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.820> let's<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.869> our

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this side I tell you what let's put our

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.969 
this side I tell you what let's put our
session<00:01:17.750> pressure<00:01:18.750> plate<00:01:19.229> stump<00:01:19.710> first<00:01:21.979> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
session pressure plate stump first you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.990 
session pressure plate stump first you
just<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:24.330> pressure<00:01:24.720> plates<00:01:25.909> from<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just get for pressure plates from the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.230 
just get for pressure plates from the
middle<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.799> place<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
middle and place this right there and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.929 
middle and place this right there and
it's<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.570> same<00:01:33.990> setup<00:01:35.869> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> Redstone

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
it's the same setup with the Redstone

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's the same setup with the Redstone
only<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.090> difference<00:01:39.979> put<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:42.140> piece<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
only one difference put a piece of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.010 
only one difference put a piece of
redstone<00:01:43.500> dust<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.990> place<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
redstone dust right here and place a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
redstone dust right here and place a
torch<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> end<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.890> then<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.360> fill<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
torch at the end and then we fill the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.130 
torch at the end and then we fill the
bottom<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> trench<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:53.100> redstone<00:01:54.140> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bottom of the trench with redstone like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.380 
bottom of the trench with redstone like
so

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.300 

so<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:01.230> we<00:02:01.410> step<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:02.010> pressure

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so now when we step on these pressure

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.510 
so now when we step on these pressure
plates<00:02:02.670> please<00:02:03.150> let's<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.630> off<00:02:03.890> lights<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.220> off

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.590 

next<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.790> is<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:11.040> come<00:02:11.550> down<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.820> this<00:02:12.300> side

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
next up is to come down on this side

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
next up is to come down on this side
where<00:02:16.790> yeah<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.890> either<00:02:19.890> side<00:02:20.250> works

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
where yeah but either side works

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.920 
where yeah but either side works
actually<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:22.170> be<00:02:22.320> sure<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.530> dig<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.930> block

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
actually but be sure to dig one block

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.330 
actually but be sure to dig one block
away<00:02:25.260> from<00:02:25.740> these<00:02:26.390> pressure<00:02:27.390> plates<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
away from these pressure plates and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.270 
away from these pressure plates and
we're<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.360> make<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> staircase<00:02:31.530> up

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
we're just going to make a staircase up

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:42.830 
we're just going to make a staircase up
on<00:02:33.200> either<00:02:34.200> side<00:02:34.850> it's<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.120> take<00:02:42.690> out

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
on either side it's like so and take out

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.430 
on either side it's like so and take out
one<00:02:43.290> block<00:02:43.650> away<00:02:44.480> from<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.840> pressure<00:02:46.080> plates

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
one block away from the pressure plates

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
one block away from the pressure plates
in<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:47.370> direction<00:02:47.610> as<00:02:48.060> well<00:02:49.520> next<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.820> place

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
in this direction as well next we place

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.870 
in this direction as well next we place
a<00:02:52.220> wire<00:02:54.080> down<00:02:55.080> there<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.740> same<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.850> other

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
a wire down there and same on the other

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.580 
a wire down there and same on the other
side<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:58.280> then<00:02:59.280> let's<00:02:59.640> place<00:03:00.380> wrap<00:03:01.380> that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
side and then let's place wrap that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.300 
side and then let's place wrap that
around<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.690> will<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:04.230> used<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
around here this will be used for the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.650 
around here this will be used for the
locking<00:03:05.790> mechanism<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:08.209> this<00:03:09.209> door<00:03:09.420> has<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
locking mechanism and this door has a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.680 
locking mechanism and this door has a
locking<00:03:09.930> mechanism<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:11.250> both<00:03:11.580> sides<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.420> only

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
locking mechanism on both sides not only

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.550 
locking mechanism on both sides not only
one<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.489> lock<00:03:14.850> your<00:03:15.150> house<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:16.290> you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
one so you can lock your house when you

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.150 
one so you can lock your house when you
go<00:03:17.250> out<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.820> adventures<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.890> when<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:19.980> come

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
go out on adventures and when you come

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
go out on adventures and when you come
back<00:03:20.340> your<00:03:20.640> house<00:03:20.790> won't<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.209> filled<00:03:21.660> with

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
back your house won't be filled with

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.970 
back your house won't be filled with
mops<00:03:22.380> left<00:03:22.920> walking<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:28.070> that's<00:03:29.070> most<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
mops left walking and that's most of

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.640 
mops left walking and that's most of
mostly<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:33.269> mechanism<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.730> to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
mostly the mechanism I'm just going to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
mostly the mechanism I'm just going to
load<00:03:37.650> up<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.040> part<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:39.060> quickly<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.959> is

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
load up this part really quickly this is

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.520
