00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
looking from my vantage point that she's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
her joint a little bit because she was

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.229 
her joint a little bit because she was
popping<00:03:18.330> out<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.519> that's<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> way<00:03:21.000> they

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
popping out and that's the way they

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.630 
popping out and that's the way they
shipped<00:03:21.540> her<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.840> me<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.340> as<00:03:23.459> you
