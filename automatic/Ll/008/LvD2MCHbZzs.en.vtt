what<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:54.899> quickly<00:00:55.350> situation<00:00:56.010> around

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
what now I'm quickly situation around

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
what now I'm quickly situation around
the<00:00:56.520> outline<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.149> shape<00:00:58.340> visit<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.789> little

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the outline of shape visit the little

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
the outline of shape visit the little
bit<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:02.600> don't<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:04.920> we

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
bit out don't want to this and then we

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.210 
bit out don't want to this and then we
did<00:01:05.220> exact<00:01:05.580> same<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:07.580> mean<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> isn't

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
did exact same really mean it isn't

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.109 
did exact same really mean it isn't
maybe<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:14.540> circles<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:20.490> outline

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
maybe do circles and there's my outline

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.030 
maybe do circles and there's my outline
and<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:21.720> would<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> inside<00:01:22.710> shape

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and now would you use the inside shape

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.460 
and now would you use the inside shape
so<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.450> cannot<00:01:25.790> stop<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> camera

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
so how do that cannot stop the camera

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
so how do that cannot stop the camera

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
plates in order them on their side of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:22.320 
plates in order them on their side of
them<00:03:10.400> exactly<00:03:20.110> now<00:03:21.110> what<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.800> little

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
same right only in plate and the exact

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.840 
same right only in plate and the exact
thing<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:44.870> I'm<00:03:45.110> leery<00:03:45.380> about

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850
