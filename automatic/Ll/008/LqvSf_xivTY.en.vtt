00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
this was going to be a sequel because

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.310 
this was going to be a sequel because
there<00:01:00.940> have<00:01:01.059> been<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.180> couple<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.540> shorts<00:01:02.079> and

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
there have been a couple of shorts and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.099 
there have been a couple of shorts and
after<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.890> film<00:01:03.070> did<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:03.520> well<00:01:03.760> right<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.959> was

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.109 
after the film did so well right it was

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.139 
after the film did so well right it was
almost<00:01:05.379> immediately<00:01:05.740> after<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.069> first<00:01:06.149> movie

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
almost immediately after the first movie

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.870 
almost immediately after the first movie
came<00:01:07.509> out<00:01:07.539> I<00:01:07.929> think<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.889> was<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.039> surprise<00:01:09.219> to

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
came out I think it was a surprise to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.760 
came out I think it was a surprise to
everyone<00:01:10.420> involved<00:01:10.719> that<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.109> did<00:01:11.259> as<00:01:11.530> well<00:01:11.709> as

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
everyone involved that it did as well as

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.999 
everyone involved that it did as well as
it<00:01:12.009> did<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:12.429> I<00:01:13.270> think<00:01:13.569> that<00:01:13.719> obviously<00:01:14.109> lent

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
it did so I think that obviously lent

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.940 
it did so I think that obviously lent
itself<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.459> a<00:01:15.819> sequel<00:01:16.359> but<00:01:16.899> beyond<00:01:17.709> that<00:01:17.920> I

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
itself to a sequel but beyond that I

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.109 
itself to a sequel but beyond that I
think<00:01:18.039> there<00:01:18.310> were<00:01:18.399> more<00:01:18.579> stories<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:18.969> tell

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
think there were more stories to tell

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.169 
think there were more stories to tell
with<00:01:19.600> this<00:01:19.749> family<00:01:19.959> and<00:01:20.319> this<00:01:20.439> guy<00:01:20.679> and<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
with this family and this guy and so the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.919 
with this family and this guy and so the
second<00:01:22.509> one<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.719> really<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:25.240> extension

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929

how<00:02:09.849> them<00:02:10.060> how<00:02:10.359> the<00:02:10.420> movie<00:02:10.659> makes<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.049> feel

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
how them how the movie makes you feel

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.130 
how them how the movie makes you feel
and<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.790> these<00:02:12.969> characters<00:02:13.450> they<00:02:13.659> don't

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and that these characters they don't

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.929 
and that these characters they don't
seem<00:02:14.469> like<00:02:14.680> animated<00:02:15.250> characters<00:02:15.609> they<00:02:15.730> seem

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
seem like animated characters they seem

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.899 
seem like animated characters they seem
very<00:02:16.239> real<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.840> very<00:02:16.900> living<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:18.700> much

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
very real and very living very much

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.740 
very real and very living very much
alive<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.719> think<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:21.280> that's<00:02:21.879> what<00:02:22.239> drew

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
alive so I think that that's what drew

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.759 
alive so I think that that's what drew
me<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> do<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.620> second<00:02:24.099> one<00:02:24.219> is<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.939> I

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
me to do a second one is that it's I

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.720 
me to do a second one is that it's I
don't<00:02:26.769> know<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:26.859> thought<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.250> first<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.519> was

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
don't know I thought the first one was

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.459 
don't know I thought the first one was
really<00:02:27.849> special<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.170> had<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.439> same

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
really special and it had the same

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.429 
really special and it had the same
writers<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.280> same<00:02:30.519> director<00:02:31.120> directors<00:02:32.109> st.

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
writers the same director directors st.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.369 
writers the same director directors st.
producers<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.939> don't<00:02:34.569> know<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.810> felt<00:02:35.079> like<00:02:35.200> we

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
producers so I don't know I felt like we

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.349 
producers so I don't know I felt like we
were<00:02:35.439> all<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.709> very<00:02:35.889> good<00:02:36.040> hands<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.909> you<00:02:36.969> were

I'm<00:02:37.569> surprised<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.439> thought<00:02:38.469> it<00:02:38.799> wasn't

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
I'm surprised that you thought it wasn't

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.979 
I'm surprised that you thought it wasn't
going<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.549> be<00:02:39.670> as<00:02:39.969> big<00:02:40.209> as<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.359> was<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.750> first

I wanted to ask how do you kind of
distinguish<00:02:55.239> all<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.750> these<00:02:55.900> very

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
distinguish all of these very

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.800 
distinguish all of these very
distinctive<00:02:57.129> characters<00:02:57.639> but<00:02:58.419> at<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.659> same

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
distinctive characters but at the same

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.229 
distinctive characters but at the same
time<00:02:59.109> keep<00:02:59.439> your<00:02:59.469> comedic<00:03:00.340> style<00:03:00.669> and<00:03:01.030> stay

time keep your comedic style and stay

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.330 
time keep your comedic style and stay
true<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.569> what<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.500> want<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.799> bring<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
true to what you want to bring to the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.399 
true to what you want to bring to the
table<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.819> don't<00:03:03.939> know<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.239> mean<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.810> was<00:03:05.139> such<00:03:05.379> a

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
table I don't know I mean it was such a

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.140 
table I don't know I mean it was such a
well<00:03:05.709> written<00:03:05.980> character<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.609> think<00:03:06.909> that's

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
well written character I think that's

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.559 
well written character I think that's
that's<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.139> key<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:09.549> any<00:03:09.700> character<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.389> if

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
that's the key to to any character is if

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.409 
that's the key to to any character is if
it<00:03:10.719> has<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> good<00:03:11.260> foundation<00:03:12.189> in<00:03:12.400> writing<00:03:13.239> and

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
it has a good foundation in writing and

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.539 
it has a good foundation in writing and
story<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.440> rest<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.859> can<00:03:14.979> be<00:03:15.040> pretty<00:03:15.310> easy

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
story the rest of it can be pretty easy

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.909 
story the rest of it can be pretty easy
and<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.419> think<00:03:16.449> this<00:03:16.810> was<00:03:16.989> no<00:03:17.379> exception<00:03:17.409> I

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
and I think this was no exception I

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.860 
and I think this was no exception I
think<00:03:18.159> the<00:03:18.250> fact<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.579> here<00:03:19.569> was<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> guy

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
think the fact that here was a guy

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.890 
think the fact that here was a guy
especially<00:03:20.409> in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.530> first<00:03:20.709> one<00:03:20.979> who<00:03:21.220> was<00:03:21.900> who

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
especially in the first one who was who

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
especially in the first one who was who
was<00:03:22.930> sort<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.590> bad<00:03:23.829> guy<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.900> someone<00:03:25.900> who

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
was sort of a bad guy but someone who

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.059 
was sort of a bad guy but someone who
who<00:03:27.430> was<00:03:27.579> available<00:03:28.000> for<00:03:28.479> redemption<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.199> and

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
who was available for redemption and and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.399 
who was available for redemption and and
this<00:03:30.609> one<00:03:30.849> he's<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.209> he's<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.900> perfect

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
this one he's not he's not a perfect

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.309 
this one he's not he's not a perfect
human<00:03:32.590> being<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:34.030> he's<00:03:34.479> he's<00:03:34.900> starting<00:03:35.229> to

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
human being but he's he's starting to

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.589 
human being but he's he's starting to
find<00:03:35.560> his<00:03:35.709> way<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.129> find<00:03:36.340> his<00:03:36.489> path<00:03:36.699> more

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
find his way and find his path more

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.240 
find his way and find his path more
heart<00:03:37.870> coming<00:03:38.139> out<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.500> them<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:38.979> more

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
heart coming out of them there is more

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.610 
heart coming out of them there is more
heart<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.699> I<00:03:39.879> think<00:03:39.939> it<00:03:40.239> also<00:03:40.389> it<00:03:40.780> also<00:03:41.079> starts

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
heart and I think it also it also starts

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.460 
heart and I think it also it also starts
to<00:03:41.680> tell<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:41.919> story<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.430> family<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.169> how<00:03:44.169> a

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
to tell a story of a family and how a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.490 
to tell a story of a family and how a
family<00:03:44.889> changes<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.579> grows<00:03:45.939> and<00:03:46.359> there<00:03:47.290> are

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
family changes and grows and there are

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.219 
family changes and grows and there are
ups<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.009> downs<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.209> not<00:03:49.479> you<00:03:49.810> know<00:03:49.930> it's

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
ups and downs and it's not you know it's

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.020 
ups and downs and it's not you know it's
not<00:03:50.379> easy<00:03:50.739> there<00:03:51.069> there's<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.400> bumpy<00:03:51.790> road

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
not easy there there's a bumpy road

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.449 
not easy there there's a bumpy road
ahead<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:55.090> i<00:03:55.720> really<00:03:56.349> i<00:03:56.379> think<00:03:56.560> character

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
ahead so I I i really i think character

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.789
