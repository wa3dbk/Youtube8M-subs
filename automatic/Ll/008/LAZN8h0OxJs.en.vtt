00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 work with moral education 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.010
 work with the values ​​it should 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 occur in the family and often 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 including us when you go to work 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.180
 with the intervention program at the school 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 question of morality the same question of good 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.750
 coexistence much that bump 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.180
 conception 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.519
 after all if it is the responsibility of the family 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.439
 is plugging hole understood the idea is to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 people are at school is fixing 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.989
 something that fits first family 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 How do you see that question, the poor man? 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 family I would say first never in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 history, the family was the only 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 institution responsible for training 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.820
 moral of our students 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 formerly there was a large 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 support of non-catechism religion she who 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.120
 in general the good boy 's speech 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.090
 girl was placed never stood alone 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 The second difference then I do not see 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.430
 Why would she be alone today? 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 It would be a 11 in the second shit right 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 before society even because - 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 democratic was more homogeneous or all 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 world think more or less the same way 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.710
 if he wore the same form, let's say 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 less diversity you have now 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 that is what you hear a family and in the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.100
 the other and practically the other 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.829
 same thing then make an echo box 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.229
 It is certain that in practice to make 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.009
 families without having to combine 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.170
 mutually help each other and school 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 Sorry school, not you, but 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 Who do you think this is and the republic school, huh? 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.390
 I think essentially of the public school is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 a school made for and is in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.979
 Brazilian constitution to form a 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.869
 citizens 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.390
 this school objective is to form a citizen 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.810
 and there is no citizenship without others 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.790
 moral things because it would not be the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.630
 role of the school is to form normally 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.579
 so yes the family has a role 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.789
 nobody will deny that the family has a 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.659
 role and it should better fulfill this 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.370
 paper but this does not excuse or 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.079
 takes responsibility for the school that is 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.370
 a responsibility 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:23.739
 say earlier when aristotle in 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.409
 was under a tree argued 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.569
 with your students, what is ethical was 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.430
 training their students about respect and moral 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.810
 and ethics 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.079
 I think the family is the last in a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.120
 thing that is the family and sometimes 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.420
 think of family reminds family of 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.799
 some 30 40 years ago a mother site children 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.030
 grandfather come back cousin was not a club here 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.340
 on the right side, right? 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.260
 nowadays the family does not have a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.569
 couple together 10 né 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 in general the family is separated from 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.349
 family also stayed small then 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.379
 it is not fulfilling its function with 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.709
 cut more reason for school 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.019
 perhaps we reinforce what has always been 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.819
 its role and whether the constitution 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.790
 Brazilian citizenship formation is there 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.449
 how to form citizens without morals and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.099
 historically it has always fulfilled and a 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:22.569
 another point is that I wanted to emphasize that 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.379
 we did some some research 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.720
 with the family from identifying by 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.859
 15 Years Young instance what all 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480
 family 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.790
 But if you get angry when you do 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.889
 wrong that every family more technology 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.379
 to see the values ​​of this family 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.449
 advice the family gives even analyze the 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.129
 content of the tickets that the school sends 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.400
 So I ask for help for this 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:50.139
 family and we arrived at a given 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.659
 interesting because it is in fact the roles 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.699
 in practice end up being very mixed 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.859
 it is not very common for them to ask 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.449
 parents to help resolve conflicts 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.440
 problem of student indiscipline 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:04.540
 help in the lesson and study but this 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.599
 question we found the following that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.120
 are two educational institutions're 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.560
 school and family is the first 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.380
 release the second socializer only 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.820
 in the family to attend to something 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.590
 who studies the conflict that are relations 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.320
 you're stable, right? 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.280
 then for example it is very common to 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.170
 child with her sister she has 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.810
 she has reactions impossible she scolds the 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.050
 father she hit but father is always father 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.270
 and at school she starts to learn right now 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.430
 public space this need to be 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.590
 why this regular stable relationship or 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.960
 be the end of my friend lost my 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.520
 My friend, another thing is that we 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.889
 I was talking discussing with the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.080
 teachers is that when talking about 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.389
 morality if the family of the private 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.580
 have values ​​that are 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.010
 school will often work 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.020
 another form for example if a 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.020
 family the boy speaks does not walk with 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.630
 that gay son of a bitch 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.730
 the school will work as if this 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.680
 gay son of a bitch in fact he has a 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.820
 sexual orientation but is the same as 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.290
 rights and duties 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.390
 what you said earlier of 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.650
 principle and this learning will only 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.840
 occur at school 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.890
 I very much agree with what you put that 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.320
 so the institutions are 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.760
 but they dialogue with each other 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.280
 the other 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.350
 but they have different natures and 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.169
 the failure of the family's quotation marks 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.180
 can be a failure of the school then to 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.410
 Otherwise these children are the ones who 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.660
 are from school 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.729
 we realized that these parents of 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.100
 difficult children they do not even care 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.680
 school that only talks in the son mode right? 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.450
 then this need to accommodate these 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.820
 parents as a professional in the 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.919
 education in a different way and 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.240
 I believe that as long as you do not change that 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.550
 paradigm is that school is also 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.820
 involved in these problems is responsible for 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.240
 We can hardly 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.240
 to transform these relations
