00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:12.929
 come on today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 comment on the fight on t71 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.410
 this is an american tank which in general 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.500
 comes as if for 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:32.700
 t21 for tank t21 next t21 of my 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.090
 favorite tanks but here t71 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 he also has an interesting side though 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.430
 by sight, but for the sake of some such 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 Obscene see how you can on it 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.309
 hit with favorable confluence 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.309
 their circumstances under certain 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 application to use it and so let's say 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 certain features 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:16.159
 his speed is fast enough 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:18.659
 then we can say that all the crack but 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.320
 one winter features 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.320
 this is a drum one which is not missing 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.970
 reloading your drum then happens 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 six shots here's a mistake 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.210
 probably allowed that well, as it would not 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.820
 it is not a mistake here personally this 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.880
 for him I notice that you can 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.180
 you could reload the drum though 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.420
 he is long enough 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.280
 recharged 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 here are three rounds in the drum hour 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:02.800
 involved but how would it happen 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.080
 that you, too, will not leave the staff, and therefore 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.050
 so it happened that is now 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.790
 you can recharge so all about 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.940
 spring 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:18.459
 in a normal way, one frag is on 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.459
 side means ours 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:29.330
 interesting tank and started selling 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.760
 maneuvers highlight the opponent of course 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.430
 on this tank you need to maneuver to stand 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.290
 it certainly can not be because any 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.440
 still hit the armor he did not 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:50.810
 so much so now three frags 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.830
 that is, you do not even have time to follow 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.700
 how is it going 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.190
 bears defeat of the enemy here a little 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.860
 slightly retarding the truth here it is necessary 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:10.100
 confess there and in my appeared there 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:13.010
 the enemy is also t71 and he is from the right connection 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.050
 the enemy and that's due to maneuvers only 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.630
 manage to survive in this situation 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:27.580
 by the way, there is no damage yet 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:34.239
 no cost still trying to get there 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.239
 not breaking and getting damage 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:48.800
 more actively on the rear 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.700
 adversary and in principle this is achieved 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.190
 wears opponent highlighted vacation again 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.810
 see that's not enough for a shot 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:07.060
 but just there too t71 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:10.599
 the enemy is destroyed in this case 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.349
 it means of course there is already a hundred 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.090
 percent 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.850
 the whole tank becomes just you 80 but 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.320
 after all five frags sorry which 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:27.419
 You also earned well for the firefighter 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.070
 which means and shot well and 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.590
 managed 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.180
 wear your firefly functions perform 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.060
 I generally like these fights when 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.700
 firefly is not just stupidly flying and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.130
 how to shine there to taste even 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.950
 there to do so shines enemy tanks 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.360
 but what is the use of it and if he immediately 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:57.490
 he dies the beginning of the battle and then 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:01.800
 I personally do not recognize any result 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.800
 what fights are not interesting
