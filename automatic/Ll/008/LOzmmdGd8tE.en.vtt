so<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.789> actually<00:00:17.940> done<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.730> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
so I'm actually done I just kind of I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.580 
so I'm actually done I just kind of I
didn't<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> adhesive<00:00:21.840> off<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> back

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
didn't take the adhesive off the back

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.660 
didn't take the adhesive off the back
yet<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> don't<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
yet because I don't know the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
yet because I don't know the
configuration<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.420> wanted<00:00:24.750> how<00:00:24.990> it'd<00:00:25.949> look

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
configuration I wanted how it'd look

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
configuration I wanted how it'd look
better<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.060> since<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:27.630> TV<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.990> actually<00:00:28.380> quite

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
better but since my TV is actually quite

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.780 
better but since my TV is actually quite
I<00:00:28.859> mean<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:29.880> small<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.640> guess

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I mean it's not small but it is I guess

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
I mean it's not small but it is I guess
it<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.059> small<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:34.110> external<00:00:34.649> whatever<00:00:34.920> 32

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it is small for not external whatever 32

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.000 
it is small for not external whatever 32
inches<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.030> actually<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.690> actually<00:00:37.050> went<00:00:37.260> how

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
inches but actually it actually went how

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
inches but actually it actually went how
I<00:00:38.040> wanted<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> side<00:00:39.570> side

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
I wanted it to go from the side side

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.100 
I wanted it to go from the side side
like<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> edges<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.110> would

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
like from the edges you know I would

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
like from the edges you know I would
actually<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> thought<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.760> gonna

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
actually I would I thought it was gonna

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
actually I would I thought it was gonna
be<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> square<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.140> that's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
be just like a square because that's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.670 
be just like a square because that's
what<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.620> meant<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.100> um<00:00:48.350> we're<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
what it's meant to be but um we're not I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
what it's meant to be but um we're not I
don't<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.579> saying<00:00:50.820> guys<00:00:51.030> um

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
don't even know what I'm saying guys um

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.880 
don't even know what I'm saying guys um
that's<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.559> because

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that's what I would think because

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
that's what I would think because
they're<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> same<00:00:53.250> length<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> would

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
they're all the same length so I would

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
they're all the same length so I would
say<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> square<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> guess<00:00:57.510> my

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
say they make a square but I guess my

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
say they make a square but I guess my
theory<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.170> wrong<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.829> I'm

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
theory was wrong so because I'm

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.299 
theory was wrong so because I'm
you<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.579> anyways<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> yeah<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:01.829> maybe<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
you get anyways so yeah I think maybe on

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
you get anyways so yeah I think maybe on
larger<00:01:05.810> monitors<00:01:06.810> apart<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.409> TVs<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:07.979> whatever

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
larger monitors apart or TVs or whatever

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
larger monitors apart or TVs or whatever
you're<00:01:08.430> gonna<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.820> say<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> want

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you're gonna use this for say you want

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
you're gonna use this for say you want
to<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.140> earth<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.770> 50<00:01:11.070> inch<00:01:11.189> it's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to use it on earth and your 50 inch it's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
to use it on earth and your 50 inch it's
definitely<00:01:11.820> gonna<00:01:11.939> make<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> square<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.960> not

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
definitely gonna make a square it's not

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.280 
definitely gonna make a square it's not
gonna<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> edges<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.280> um<00:01:15.180> let's<00:01:16.020> try

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
gonna go on the edges so um let's try

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
gonna go on the edges so um let's try
this<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> looks<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this out see how it looks to get the

Clips put them in between the LEDs see
how<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.330> looks<00:02:01.600> um<00:02:02.310> okay<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.730> not<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.080> lot

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
how it looks um okay it's not has a lot

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.720 
how it looks um okay it's not has a lot
of<00:02:05.350> space<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:06.010> like<00:02:07.500> feet<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.679> half<00:02:08.860> probably

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
of space I like feet and a half probably

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.650 
of space I like feet and a half probably
for<00:02:10.149> now

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.500 

of<00:02:13.660> space<00:02:14.290> between<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.860> wall<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:16.210> kind<00:02:16.450> of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
of space between the wall so it kind of

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:27.020 
of space between the wall so it kind of
brightens<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:17.020> lot<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:19.450> fine<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.080> got<00:02:26.290> red

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
brightens a lot it's fine so you got red

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.670 
brightens a lot it's fine so you got red
helmet<00:02:28.030> who<00:02:28.150> says<00:02:28.420> green<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.000> go<00:02:31.120> blue<00:02:31.900> let<00:02:32.620> me

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
helmet who says green and go blue let me

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
but like I've read that it reduces

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.060 
but like I've read that it reduces
eyestrain<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.790> also<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.360> creates<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:23.070> another

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
eyestrain and also it creates a another

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.130 
eyestrain and also it creates a another
level<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.580> immersion<00:03:25.239> into<00:03:25.720> what<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.260> watch

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
