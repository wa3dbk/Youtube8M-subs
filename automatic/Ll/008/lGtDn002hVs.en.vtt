a little bit I gotta get rid of some of
the<00:02:49.310> transitions<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.210> little<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.380> can

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
the transitions a little so that you can

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.180 
the transitions a little so that you can
see<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.460> more<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.650> voicing<00:02:55.040> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
see it some more so if the voicing is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.980 
see it some more so if the voicing is
off<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> little<00:02:55.550> bit<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.330> had<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.690> take

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
of weird barriers but they're pretty

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.390 
of weird barriers but they're pretty
high<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:07.270> now<00:03:08.270> right<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.770> have<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:10.160> also

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
much jump night them all the way up here

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.160 
much jump night them all the way up here
and<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.940> have<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.330> extend<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:20.780> clip<00:03:21.080> tears<00:03:21.350> oh

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and I have to extend this clip tears oh

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.880 
and I have to extend this clip tears oh
sorry<00:03:24.170> about<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.810> one<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
sorry about that and this one is the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.949 
sorry about that and this one is the
last<00:03:28.130> one<00:03:28.520> but<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:28.970> probably<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.690> funnest

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
last one but it's probably the funnest

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.530 
last one but it's probably the funnest
because<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.830> gets<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.550> completely<00:03:32.300> away<00:03:32.510> from

won't you just need it there to get high
enough<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.160> then<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.400> need<00:04:04.580> three<00:04:04.820> people

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090
