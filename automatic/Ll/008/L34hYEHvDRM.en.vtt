00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
striker in this team and I decided to do

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.060 
striker in this team and I decided to do
the<00:02:34.700> marking<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.390> him<00:02:35.660> because<00:02:35.840> lasell<00:02:36.440> will

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
the marking on him because lasell will

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.610 
the marking on him because lasell will
be<00:02:37.280> cutting<00:02:37.700> him<00:02:37.820> off<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.180> game<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.750> he<00:02:39.290> plays

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
be cutting him off the game if he plays

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.040 
be cutting him off the game if he plays
so<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.430> was<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> good<00:02:41.180> decision<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.750> make

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
so that was a good decision to make

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.770 
so that was a good decision to make
because<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.680> cell<00:02:42.980> was<00:02:43.790> shutting<00:02:44.570> him<00:02:44.750> down

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
because the cell was shutting him down

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.920 
because the cell was shutting him down
and<00:02:45.740> that<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.220> helped<00:02:46.610> me<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.880> lot<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.570> he

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
and that really helped me a lot and he

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.230 
and that really helped me a lot and he
is<00:02:48.140> actually<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.070> be<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.640> player<00:02:49.970> of
