00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 yes 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.259
 the photograph freezes the instant one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 scene the camera and the subject 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 they have to stay still at least 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.970
 during the fraction of a second that lasts 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.580
 the exhibition anyway this is not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.289
 a fixed standard as the movement can 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.289
 be a very interesting topic 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.939
 with long exposure times the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.100
 movement of the subject or the camera 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.670
 allow to get special effects and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670
 creative 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.620
 yes 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 think of the water running in the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.149
 ability to hypnotize that exerts in the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.990
 observer and in the feeling of strength and 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.510
 freedom that transmits 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.370
 these impressions would be lost if 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.830
 capture the subject using a 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.660
 take a short time then the result 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.210
 it would be an image with the effect of water 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.460
 frozen to get that force from the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.010
 moving water fixes the camera in a 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.820
 tripod uses exposure times 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.890
 lengths of at least one second and it takes 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 the photograph when there is not much light 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.750
 to reflect the dynamism of a scene 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.470
 takes pictures in which the subject 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.890
 the contrails are frozen and clear 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.960
 background give faith of the movement to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.120
 get this effect in addition to times 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.460
 long takes advantage of the possibilities 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.500
 offers the flash using a camera 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.310
 that allows to synchronize it with the second 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.310
 shutter curtain 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.770
 Normally the flash fires when 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 the shutter starts the exhibition 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.260
 in this case instead it has to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.270
 shoot a moment before the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.609
 shutter close 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.039
 the result is to capture the 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.390
 wake of the movement and only at the end 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.390
 fix the object 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 another technique that emphasizes the effect of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.040
 movement is the bread in 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.980
 the camera and the subject in square 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.280
 move synchronously in parallel and to the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.800
 same speed 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.709
 if they have done at the same time the two 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.990
 movements are annulled the result is 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.770
 a photograph with the sharp subject and the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.770
 moved background 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.750
 This technique is suitable for scenes in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.790
 which you want to reinforce the effect of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.000
 speed as in the competitions of 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.000
 Formula 1 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.610
 finally varying the focal length 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.269
 zoom while shooting is created the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.269
 movement effect 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.290
 for the operation to be more effective 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.910
 place the camera on a tripod 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.640
 frames a stopped subject and uses 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.540
 Long exposure times of 130 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.540
 seconds for example 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.159
 let yourself be carried away by creativity 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.510
 violates the rules and tests 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.510
 photograph in other conditions 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.490
 move the camera using times 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.610
 long takes subjects in motion and not 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.470
 with gels you will discover that even 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.130
 moved can also explain a 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.130
 interesting story 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.970
 and
