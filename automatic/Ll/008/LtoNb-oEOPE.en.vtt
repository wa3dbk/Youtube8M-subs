00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 ea sports girlfriend simone were muscle 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.950
 The maker has always been lately 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.509
 again asked how it looks with the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.799
 word how can you get on properly 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.360
 to prepare his training 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.769
 Of course there are different ones 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.900
 possibilities also after own 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.529
 You have to go to school for 20 minutes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 make cardio training 20 minutes jogging 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 Maybe it would not sprint 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 again too much but going to the wheel or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.150
 So this rowing machine do this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 cardio row up to the theory that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 you are so true 20 minutes first 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 I have to do it completely from my point of view 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 covered for ten minutes intense 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.369
 Realize completely rake off and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.829
 Cargobereich first around the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
 body temperature also sports level too 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.309
 Of course, they are also mental 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.660
 to prepare for the first time 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.860
 again the blood pressure in the area too 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 get by then also sporten 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 can then be weighted with the one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 can prove 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.710
 that's the first one out of mine 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.329
 view enough 10 to 15 minutes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.649
 for one more for the other 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.610
 less could on the fitness condition 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.079
 on to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.850
 I feel personally at ten 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.350
 minutes cardio training optimally 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 is the distance if i agree 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 home in my little team then drive 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 I'm just warm 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 then I have already done that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 then we come to the next point 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.339
 just as far as the joints I am concerned 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 when one is trained the upper body 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.580
 the shoulder in any case the sensitive 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 area if you lower your body 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 of course you have to train a knee 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.790
 but think to go in horny hip joints 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 but first from the upper body of mine 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.939
 the most important thing to do 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.900
 should it be the rotator cuff of my 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.380
 Just shoulder a bit 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.939
 do 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 I can cabel you that for a short time 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.680
 to show one of the exercises 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 easy laid I am one 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.600
 inveterate help and cable train 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.649
 but you can wonderful the school here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 make it a little bit true 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.680
 important is that you have a light weight 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 does not take care of any here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.240
 great performances even trims that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 is a warm just makes it one 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.159
 know exercise the shoulder 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.869
 prepare 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.090
 Also very good if you are the poor 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.490
 Of course you can also let the height 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
 Understand the km accordingly in the future 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.179
 that is a very simple possibility 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.899
 we definitely need one for that 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.250
 cable train 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.630
 I've already times another 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.850
 video of me said from my point of view 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.429
 is pretty much the last thing you want for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 home used because dakar terms of for 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.009
 Commercial needs are made 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.319
 really expensive 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.450
 most who do not have a cable at home 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.860
 to go before you really something good 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.489
 you should buy it better 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.319
 to let 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.810
 an announcement with the way one 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.340
 It can also be very muscular 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.200
 for warmmachen very well suited and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.000
 though so-called poor presses arnold 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.819
 circle to take a very center 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.060
 act small 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.180
 maybe ten pages will join us 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.459
 Mr. with the act in a position 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.859
 out so that the back points outwards 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:45.340
 and move the hand of a bus 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:51.040
 up while we are in the wrist 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.540
 attacked so that all of it with me and 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400
 fluid from memory to the first 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.439
 mainacht which experience is collecting 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.849
 it is not as simple as that 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:03.010
 from the condition to beech and 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.900
 starting position is always the hand 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.609
 Meaningful body of the hands back time 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.049
 home 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.209
 then will act over your head 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.720
 pressed together so that the poor too 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.530
 about 95 percent known so that's 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.209
 a star it is very suitable for the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.010
 What I tell you is true 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.989
 can also recommend is with a 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.599
 light weight in any case 50 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.379
 percent at least 50 percent below 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.849
 your training weight that you do that 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.979
 shoulder a back shoulder 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.590
 takes stand again and that is 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:39.760
 but they also inform as thoughtful 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.540
 slowly drove on in none 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.819
 moment isometric obtained 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.319
 yes in the rotator cuff is 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.669
 always warming up is very important 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.079
 that you do not get off your shoulder 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.150
 just hurt the shoulder is what 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.650
 I quite sensitive speak from twelve 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.580
 years of training experience when you first 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.320
 with the shoulder 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.970
 you usually will not have them anymore 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.410
 go and the inflammation can 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.120
 stubbornly sitting in the shoulder 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.650
 I'm looking for it, I have twelve 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.210
 no problems with the shoulder 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.340
 and just the other celebrities of the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.320
 all understood and of course 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.180
 Take make-up into account and be prepared 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.940
 To warm me up these ten minutes 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.859
 These 15 minutes to invest 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.910
 After that, bring the best of them all 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.930
 guys and all girls from mine 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.940
 training program of course have 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.350
 already makes her personal warm 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.150
 program get the distinction too 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.350
 put between warmbach and work 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.240
 I do not want to go that far 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.100
 so always think your joint in 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.900
 first line shoulder joints at 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.690
 upper body training no matter if jazz day 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.280
 shoulder day or back day shoulders 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.630
 are especially important to have warm 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160
 you can do that too 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.660
 in the long run can do this sport 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.610
 All right, see you next 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.610
 Many greetings your simmern
