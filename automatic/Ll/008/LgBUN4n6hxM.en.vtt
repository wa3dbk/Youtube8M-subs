it's not always down at the bottom it

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's not always down at the bottom it
could<00:01:45.550> be<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.790> top<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.300> could<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.600> somewhere

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
could be up top it could be somewhere

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.320 
could be up top it could be somewhere
else<00:01:47.290> where<00:01:47.560> they're<00:01:47.710> at<00:01:47.890> menus<00:01:48.220> or<00:01:48.670> or

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.550 
played with these earlier they work
really<00:04:51.150> well<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.600> gave<00:04:51.810> everyone<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.410> the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
house a good laugh so the other thing in

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.380 
house a good laugh so the other thing in
the<00:04:56.040> camera<00:04:56.430> would<00:04:56.550> be<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.820> panoramic

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
the camera would be the panoramic

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.430 
the camera would be the panoramic
feature<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:59.370> basically<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.480> do<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.900> snap

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
feature and basically all you do is snap

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.440 
feature and basically all you do is snap
a<00:05:01.470> photo<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.280> then<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.700> tells<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.210> start

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
a photo and then it tells you to start

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.730 
a photo and then it tells you to start
going<00:05:03.600> one<00:05:03.870> way<00:05:03.900> or<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.290> other

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
going one way or the other

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.290 
going one way or the other
can't<00:05:05.190> really<00:05:05.370> do<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.730> camera<00:05:06.000> but<00:05:06.270> you

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
can't really do it on camera but you

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.390 
can't really do it on camera but you
would<00:05:06.450> go<00:05:06.570> around<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.110> then<00:05:07.770> click<00:05:08.040> this<00:05:08.220> to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
would go around and then click this to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.160 
would go around and then click this to
stop<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.180> would<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.720> know<00:05:09.810> piece<00:05:10.020> it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
stop it and it would you know piece it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.240 
stop it and it would you know piece it
together<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.560> all<00:05:10.620> that<00:05:10.800> good<00:05:10.890> stuff<00:05:10.950> so

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
second um and it's called app to say do

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.030 
second um and it's called app to say do
I<00:05:27.840> know<00:05:27.990> if<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.140> just<00:05:28.170> said<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:28.710> app

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
I know if I just said that so app

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.820 
I know if I just said that so app
disabling<00:05:29.640> is<00:05:29.880> built<00:05:30.240> natively<00:05:30.510> into<00:05:31.050> ICS<00:05:31.560> and

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
disabling is built natively into ICS and

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.010 
disabling is built natively into ICS and
it<00:05:32.190> allows<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.910> look<00:05:33.030> at<00:05:33.150> system<00:05:33.600> apps<00:05:33.780> and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
it allows you to look at system apps and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.020 
it allows you to look at system apps and
disable<00:05:34.470> them<00:05:34.650> or<00:05:34.920> hide<00:05:35.520> them<00:05:35.730> from<00:05:35.940> view

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
disable them or hide them from view

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.300
