little bit of an anatomy lesson if you
look<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> tooth<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.910> gum<00:00:36.180> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
look at this tooth right here the gum is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.410 
look at this tooth right here the gum is
as<00:00:36.899> thin<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.530> paper<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.730> skin<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.360> your

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
as thin as paper it is the skin of your

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
as thin as paper it is the skin of your
teeth<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.680> push<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.370> finger<00:00:41.730> across

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
teeth and if I push my finger across

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.540 
teeth and if I push my finger across
here<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> push<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> blood<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:43.950> you're

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
here and push the blood out you're

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
here and push the blood out you're
actually<00:00:45.000> looking<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.989> bone<00:00:46.260> that's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually looking at the bone that's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.340 
actually looking at the bone that's
holding<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> tooth<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> place<00:00:48.350> underneath

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
holding the tooth in place underneath

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979 
holding the tooth in place underneath
there<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> bone<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:51.059> thin<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.750> an

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
there that bone is as thin as an

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.799 
there that bone is as thin as an
eggshell<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> enamel<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.539> you're

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
eggshell so is the enamel if you're

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
eggshell so is the enamel if you're
using<00:00:54.989> conventional<00:00:55.440> brush<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> over

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
using conventional brush and over

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.360 
using conventional brush and over
brushing<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.539> gum<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:58.050> disappear<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
brushing that gum will disappear the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.340 
brushing that gum will disappear the
bone<00:00:59.640> that's<00:01:00.030> underneath<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.960> will

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bone that's underneath there will

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
bone that's underneath there will
disappear<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.579> enamel<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.270> wear<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
disappear the enamel will wear out and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
disappear the enamel will wear out and
the<00:01:04.619> interior<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> tooth<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.790> naturally

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the interior of a tooth is naturally

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
the interior of a tooth is naturally
yellow<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.290> tooth<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.710> actually

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
yellow so your tooth will actually

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
yellow so your tooth will actually
become<00:01:08.280> darker<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.380> sensitive<00:01:10.380> to

become darker and more sensitive to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.780 
become darker and more sensitive to
especially<00:01:11.100> cold<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.350> epidemic
