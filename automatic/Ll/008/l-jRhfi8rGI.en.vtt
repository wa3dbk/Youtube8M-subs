00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
blowing pedal just controlled by a

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.510 
blowing pedal just controlled by a
little<00:00:16.180> string<00:00:16.480> there<00:00:16.860> move<00:00:17.860> the<00:00:18.010> pot<00:00:18.250> you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
little string there move the pot you

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.170 
little string there move the pot you
just<00:00:18.580> kinda<00:00:19.180> move<00:00:19.330> defeat<00:00:20.099> like<00:00:21.099> so<00:00:21.460> except

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
just kinda move defeat like so except

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.749 
just kinda move defeat like so except
for<00:00:22.300> with<00:00:22.509> your<00:00:22.570> feet<00:00:22.779> by<00:00:22.930> your<00:00:23.050> pants<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:24.369> in

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
for with your feet by your pants as in

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.659 
for with your feet by your pants as in
out<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:25.349> tuner<00:00:26.349> out<00:00:26.500> which<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.610> don't

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
out and tuner out which I don't

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.339 
out and tuner out which I don't
recommend<00:00:28.029> using<00:00:28.570> unless<00:00:28.899> you<00:00:29.020> have<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.140> buffer

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
recommend using unless you have a buffer

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.499 
recommend using unless you have a buffer
before<00:00:29.649> and<00:00:29.980> accurate<00:00:30.310> it's<00:00:30.970> kinda<00:00:31.390> have<00:00:31.480> to

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
before and accurate it's kinda have to

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.850 
before and accurate it's kinda have to
cut<00:00:31.810> add-ons<00:00:32.200> oh<00:00:34.620> yeah

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
cut add-ons oh yeah

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.510 
cut add-ons oh yeah
so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.920> really<00:00:39.100> need<00:00:39.340> that<00:00:39.400> much

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
so I don't really need that much

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.960 
so I don't really need that much
explaining<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:41.230> just<00:00:41.410> gonna<00:00:41.560> run<00:00:41.740> it<00:00:41.890> well<00:00:42.700> I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
explaining I'm just gonna run it well I

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.190 
explaining I'm just gonna run it well I
want<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:43.390> tell<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.540> I'm<00:00:43.630> gonna<00:00:43.720> right<00:00:43.930> here

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
want to tell you I'm gonna right here

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.260 
want to tell you I'm gonna right here
and<00:00:44.710> then<00:00:45.220> just<00:00:45.400> do<00:00:45.520> it<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:45.670> can<00:00:45.880> encode<00:00:46.090> up<00:00:46.210> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
and then just do it I can encode up the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and then just do it I can encode up the
video<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:47.020> run<00:00:47.650> this<00:00:48.100> after<00:00:49.030> my<00:00:49.900> overdrive

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
video I run this after my overdrive

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.040 
video I run this after my overdrive
pedals<00:00:50.650> so<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.250> can<00:00:51.490> kind<00:00:51.730> of<00:00:51.850> like<00:00:52.330> fine-tune

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
pedals so I can kind of like fine-tune

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.220 
pedals so I can kind of like fine-tune
the<00:00:53.620> output<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.130> them<00:00:54.990> depend<00:00:55.990> on<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.170> know

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
the output of them depend on you know

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.270 
the output of them depend on you know
what's<00:00:56.410> going<00:00:56.560> on<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.829> band<00:00:57.010> everything

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
what's going on in the band everything

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.319 
what's going on in the band everything
and<00:00:57.579> I<00:00:58.450> run<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.720> before<00:00:59.290> my<00:00:59.740> foots<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.060> can

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
and I run it before my foots so I can

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.060 
and I run it before my foots so I can
kind<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.630> find<00:01:01.960> him<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.320> gang<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.829> fuzz

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
kind of find him the gang of the fuzz

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.740 
kind of find him the gang of the fuzz
it's<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.400> buzz<00:01:03.579> based<00:01:03.850> circuit<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:04.420> think

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
it's a buzz based circuit I think

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.179 
it's a buzz based circuit I think
there's<00:01:04.960> some<00:01:05.140> face<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:05.770> it's<00:01:05.890> like<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
there's some face but it's like the

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.870 
there's some face but it's like the
analog<00:01:06.400> manual<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:09.219> fine<00:01:09.399> Tunes<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
analog manual and it fine Tunes the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
analog manual and it fine Tunes the
bunch<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:11.219> lot<00:01:12.219> of<00:01:12.340> versatility<00:01:12.700> there

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
bunch so a lot of versatility there

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.289 
bunch so a lot of versatility there
most<00:01:15.159> people<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.399> smack<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.789> right<00:01:15.999> in<00:01:16.119> front

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
most people just smack it right in front

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.080 
most people just smack it right in front
of<00:01:16.359> chain<00:01:16.619> whatever<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.759> already

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
so that was the wrong pedal jr. by

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.350 
so that was the wrong pedal jr. by
turning<00:05:11.080> ball<00:05:11.260> checking<00:05:12.250> back<00:05:12.370> here<00:05:12.580> at<00:05:12.850> Ernie

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
turning ball checking back here at Ernie

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.490 
turning ball checking back here at Ernie
Ball<00:05:13.630> calm<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:15.330> short<00:05:16.330> scale<00:05:16.630> though<00:05:17.290> I<00:05:17.320> don't

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
Ball calm and short scale though I don't

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.050 
Ball calm and short scale though I don't
know<00:05:17.620> where<00:05:17.740> it's<00:05:17.919> gonna<00:05:18.010> be<00:05:18.130> by<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.400> scale

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
know where it's gonna be by the scale

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.409 
know where it's gonna be by the scale
about<00:05:19.210> somewhere<00:05:20.080> here<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.250> think
