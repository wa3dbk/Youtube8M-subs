00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello dear viewers welcome 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 to the third series of video guides 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.930
 on industrial craft and the second 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.340
 experiment and in this release I want 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.590
 tell you about the most basic 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.009
 energy sources that can 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.150
 brighten up without using mechanisms and 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.590
 so the most basic the very first 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 our source of energy is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.369
 generator generator produces energy 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 using fuel that burns in it 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 charcoal can serve as fuel 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 coal wood boards and shelves in general everything 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 what burns can be used in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.719
 the generator as fuel crumble 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 generator as follows down 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.340
 the center we put the iron stove in the second 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 row we put iron plates us them 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 It will take three pieces and up by 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 the middle we put the battery and we 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 we get the generator it produces 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.210
 pretty good amount 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 energy the next two recipes are 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.100
 water mill and windy 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.859
 windmills sneak they all using 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 Already finished generator 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.979
 recipes for them now we will begin to scratch them 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 perhaps with a water mill 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.619
 generator set in the center on the sides 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.390
 above and below we put boards and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.840
 the corners we put the shelves and we get 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 two water mills it is very weak 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.290
 source of energy but he is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 infinite the next recipe is wind turbine 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 in the corners, we put 4 and iron ingots 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009
 in the center we put the generator and we 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.430
 it turns out the windmill is pretty too 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.290
 weak but still he is stronger than you 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 know the mill produces energy and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.869
 Now I will demonstrate how it all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.400
 works and so I already prepared here 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.560
 small pool for a water mill 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.180
 truth is required in order for it to be 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.829
 completely 3 water mill what 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.490
 fully worked required of course 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.560
 smaller pool but still I built 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 bigger and so we need a bucket 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.770
 water batteries boards ladder and coal 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.549
 to show it all let's start 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 perhaps with a water mill 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.619
 now let's dive in the center we 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.590
 put it like this 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.660
 boards and at the very center I put the water 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.930
 the mill 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:22.200
 the rest we do not need here already 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:29.160
 has a break so let's break everything 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.290
 the rest and why do we need batteries 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.790
 Now we need a battery in order 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 to put it in the water mill we 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.360
 we put down the water mill and see what 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.930
 the battery began to type 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 energy that is to accumulate and and how 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.830
 energy is pretty slow 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.480
 comes in and this is the slowest source 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.810
 energy that is generally in industrial 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 craft 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.800
 and if we put a bucket of water we will notice 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.010
 that the water is gone and the energy has become 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.080
 replenish much faster yes here 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.420
 it 's pretty fast source 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.700
 energy but still so fast 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.700
 worked need to replenish it constantly 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.570
 water and it's all pretty long 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 there will be a process going and ineffective 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.440
 let's move to the next source 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.300
 energy this wind turbine wind turbine well 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.580
 works when he's at high altitude and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.989
 there are no blocks around on 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:30.140
 a distance of 9 by 9 and so let's ka 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.880
 we will rise high and put a windmill there 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.230
 so enough here are nine on 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.890
 nine by nine nowhere is any 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.750
 blocks and we put a windmill and put 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.450
 here the battery as we see the battery 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.000
 started charging and charging it faster 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.910
 than if the water mill worked 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.150
 by itself but it's all the same too 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.250
 pretty slow energy source 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.550
 now let's go down like this 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.610
 way and move on to the most such 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.340
 the main and good source of energy 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.880
 it is a generator generator as i have 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.340
 spoke running from fuel and let's 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.330
 put coal here as we see the process 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.260
 go and have a generator inside your 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.959
 accumulative energy storage 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.980
 how energy will be spent when we 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.810
 put some thing here 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.270
 let's say battery or connect it 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.370
 some mechanism energy 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.950
 accumulated a little it can already be wasted 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.080
 put the battery here and see that 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.690
 very, very fast in the battery 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.970
 energy accumulates 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.430
 now when in charge of the generator itself 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.950
 ran out of energy then we see with which 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.650
 speed battery is replenished 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.880
 very quickly but coal is wasted but i 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.580
 I note that you can certainly use 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.530
 charcoal and it will be in 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.350
 replenishable resource and with the same 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.180
 speed will accumulate energy then 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.390
 there is a very good source of energy 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.890
 and on this I think we are all with you 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.540
 watched the most basic sources 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.730
 energies that are in industrial craft 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.610
 and which can be crafted without 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.780
 using mechanisms a in the next 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.240
 series we are with you the main red 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.250
 mechanisms and i will show you one more 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.730
 energy source that we can already 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.560
 brighten up 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.580
 and that's all thanks to all for watching 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.580
 and all bye
