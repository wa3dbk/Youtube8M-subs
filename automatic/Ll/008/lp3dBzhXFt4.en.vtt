happened to be looking out the window
and<00:01:01.790> said<00:01:02.329> damn<00:01:03.100> that's<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:04.879> big<00:01:05.059> solar

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
and said damn that's a really big solar

and said damn that's a really big solar
farm<00:01:05.719> down<00:01:05.990> there<00:01:06.259> if<00:01:06.469> you<00:01:06.710> could<00:01:06.890> get<00:01:07.040> this

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
farm down there if you could get this

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.810 
farm down there if you could get this
stuff<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:07.610> people's<00:01:07.909> roofs<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.549> really

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
stuff on people's roofs and that really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.030 
stuff on people's roofs and that really
was<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.150> germination<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.830> first

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
was the germination of it the first

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.560 
was the germination of it the first
patent<00:01:13.520> was<00:01:13.670> issued<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.420> 1997<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
patent was issued in 1997 and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.300 
patent was issued in 1997 and
unfortunately<00:01:17.570> none<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.860> photovoltaic

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
unfortunately none of the photovoltaic

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.130 
unfortunately none of the photovoltaic
materials<00:01:20.119> were<00:01:21.020> cost<00:01:21.409> effective<00:01:21.979> for

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
materials were cost effective for

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.180 
materials were cost effective for
dispersal<00:01:24.140> across<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.500> roof<00:01:26.740> really<00:01:27.740> until<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
dispersal across a roof really until the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.420 
dispersal across a roof really until the
last<00:01:28.340> couple<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.670> years<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.190> really

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
last couple of years and so it's really

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.190 
last couple of years and so it's really
been<00:01:31.790> since<00:01:32.770> 2003<00:01:33.770> or<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.299> since<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:35.420> we've

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
been since 2003 or so since that we've

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.560 
been since 2003 or so since that we've
been<00:01:36.350> able<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.799> actually<00:01:36.979> get<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:38.360> whole

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
been able to actually get the whole

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.380 
been able to actually get the whole
process<00:01:38.810> moving<00:01:39.640> there<00:01:40.640> there<00:01:40.909> really<00:01:41.210> have

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
process moving there there really have

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.840 
process moving there there really have
been<00:01:41.420> several<00:01:42.380> obstacles<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
been several obstacles to the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.820 
been several obstacles to the
incorporation<00:01:44.720> or<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.140> integration<00:01:45.710> of

photovoltaics into construction in the
US<00:01:50.320> there's<00:01:51.320> been<00:01:51.619> cost<00:01:53.200> aesthetics<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
US there's been cost aesthetics and

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.179 
US there's been cost aesthetics and
installation<00:01:56.290> right<00:01:57.290> now<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.530> need<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.920> you

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
installation right now you need to you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
value-added reseller that you have to

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.440 
value-added reseller that you have to
call<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.740> he<00:02:03.890> has<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.220> design<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.880> system<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
call and he has to design the system and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.169 
call and he has to design the system and
order<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> component<00:02:06.890> parts<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.430> then

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
order the component parts and then

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.089 
order the component parts and then
install<00:02:08.539> them<00:02:08.750> which<00:02:09.379> is<00:02:09.409> a<00:02:09.590> six<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.039> eight

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
install them which is a six to eight

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.640 
install them which is a six to eight
month<00:02:10.310> process<00:02:10.690> what<00:02:11.690> we've<00:02:11.840> designed<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
month process what we've designed is a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.290 
month process what we've designed is a
roofing<00:02:13.310> tile<00:02:13.580> system<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:15.319> basically<00:02:15.620> is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
roofing tile system that basically is

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.740 
roofing tile system that basically is
visually<00:02:17.300> integrated<00:02:19.000> seamless<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.209> terms<00:02:20.510> of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
visually integrated seamless in terms of

its visual impact and can be installed
by<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> roofer<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.750> we've<00:02:26.930> actually<00:02:27.080> had

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
by a roofer and we've actually had

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.530 
by a roofer and we've actually had
roofing<00:02:27.739> companies<00:02:28.130> tell<00:02:28.340> us<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.700> their

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
roofing companies tell us that their

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.820 
roofing companies tell us that their
roofers<00:02:29.840> could<00:02:29.989> be<00:02:30.080> trained<00:02:30.349> in<00:02:30.440> as<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.739> as

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
roofers could be trained in as little as

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.670 
roofers could be trained in as little as
half<00:02:30.980> an<00:02:31.160> hour<00:02:31.870> there<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.050> fact<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.470> been

half an hour there in fact have been

several approaches that have been

several approaches that have been
considered<00:02:36.459> we<00:02:37.459> certainly<00:02:37.700> considered

and<00:03:27.349> in<00:03:27.680> fact<00:03:29.140> worked<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:30.290> me<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.470> convince

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
and in fact worked with me to convince

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.040 
and in fact worked with me to convince
certainteed<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:32.330> become<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> partner

certainteed to become a partner
certainteed<00:03:33.800> being<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.280> fairly<00:03:35.000> large<00:03:35.209> roofing

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
certainteed being a fairly large roofing

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.660 
certainteed being a fairly large roofing
manufacturer<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.129> we<00:03:37.220> actually<00:03:37.489> have<00:03:37.640> a

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
manufacturer so we actually have a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.369 
manufacturer so we actually have a
roofing<00:03:38.120> partner<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.720> part<00:03:39.050> of<00:03:39.200> our

roofing partner as part of our
development<00:03:40.069> process<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.550> hopefully

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
development process and that hopefully

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.640 
development process and that hopefully
will<00:03:43.670> provide<00:03:44.090> us<00:03:44.300> with<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:45.260> roofing

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
will provide us with the roofing

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.790 
will provide us with the roofing
distribution<00:03:46.280> channels<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.840> some<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.560> the

be as efficient on really hot sunny days
