00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.150

 I think it's dreadful. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 exactly but I think that's it then it's 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.640
 in the friendship quest of the mouth look Jorge 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.129
 factors therein that releases the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.780
