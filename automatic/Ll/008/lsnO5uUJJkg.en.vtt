that<00:03:23.040> palette<00:03:23.970> now<00:03:24.359> for<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.780> smoothers<00:03:25.349> let

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.270 
that palette now for the smoothers let
me<00:03:25.709> show<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:25.919> what<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.370> looks<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.790> swatched

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.890 

so<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.579> what<00:03:32.729> it<00:03:32.819> looks<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.209> it's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.749 
so this is what it looks like it's
obviously<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.919> lighter<00:03:35.129> than<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> others

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:35.759 
obviously a lot lighter than the others

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:40.099 
obviously a lot lighter than the others
and<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.239> wish<00:03:36.509> I<00:03:36.750> had<00:03:37.079> my<00:03:37.889> medium<00:03:38.519> handy<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.569 
this is what it looks like it's really
really<00:03:42.030> rich<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.479> creamy<00:03:42.750> creamier<00:03:43.590> than<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
really rich and creamy creamier than the

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.110 
really rich and creamy creamier than the
rest<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:45.090> them<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.659> thick<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.590> full<00:03:47.120> coverage

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
camouflage dick I really like this

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.150 
camouflage dick I really like this
because<00:04:42.390> it's<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.260> pencil<00:04:43.650> form<00:04:43.890> which<00:04:44.130> is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
because it's in a pencil form which is

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.930 
because it's in a pencil form which is
easy<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:45.390> use<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:47.040> like<00:04:47.220> using<00:04:47.370> my<00:04:47.580> fingers

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
easy to use but I like using my fingers

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.510 
easy to use but I like using my fingers
because<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.420> does<00:04:48.630> warm<00:04:49.020> up<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:50.070> product

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
because it does warm up the product

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.280 
because it does warm up the product
before<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.880> apply<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.780> not<00:04:51.900> such<00:04:52.260> a

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
before I apply it so it's not such a

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.040 
before I apply it so it's not such a
harsh<00:04:52.650> line<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.430> really<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.390> work<00:04:54.630> in<00:04:54.870> my

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
harsh line and really have to work in my

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.310 
harsh line and really have to work in my
bag<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:56.160> this<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.210> what<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.630> product<00:04:58.110> looks

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
