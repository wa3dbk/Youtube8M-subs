00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.900 
of the micro drive a gig micro drive and
as<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.510> able<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:26.510> we<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:28.910> actually

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
as you be able to see we just actually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
as you be able to see we just actually
move<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.300> forward<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.930> park<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.530> has<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.680> little

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
move a forward to park it has a little

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.069 
move a forward to park it has a little
more<00:00:32.009> action<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.410> go<00:00:34.410> fullscreen<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.930> as<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
more action and go fullscreen and as you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.540 
more action and go fullscreen and as you
can<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.230> pretty<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.940> saw<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
can see pretty much like we saw on the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.559 
can see pretty much like we saw on the
mini<00:00:41.550> SD<00:00:45.019> it's<00:00:46.019> fluid<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:47.280> skipping<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:48.420> i

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
mini SD it's fluid no skipping and i

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.509 
mini SD it's fluid no skipping and i
think<00:00:48.749> it's<00:00:48.870> highly<00:00:49.019> dependent<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.679> how<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
think it's highly dependent on how you

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.029 
think it's highly dependent on how you
are<00:00:50.550> converting<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.719> putting<00:00:52.440> video<00:00:52.679> on<00:00:52.829> here

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
are converting and putting video on here

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.189 
are converting and putting video on here
because<00:00:53.100> i<00:00:53.370> had<00:00:54.210> another<00:00:54.479> one<00:00:54.719> before<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
because i had another one before that

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
because i had another one before that
not<00:00:58.199> placed<00:00:58.499> so<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:58.889> because<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.159> didn't<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
not placed so well because i didn't do a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.479 
not placed so well because i didn't do a
good<00:00:59.819> conversion<00:01:01.010> i'll<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.339> at<00:01:02.460> my

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
good conversion i'll have to look at my

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.939 
good conversion i'll have to look at my
settings<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
settings and see if i can put in some of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
settings and see if i can put in some of
the<00:01:05.010> settings<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.850> readers<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.750> what

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the settings just so readers know what

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
the settings just so readers know what

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
settings I've been using for that so as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.360

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the 80 gig hard drive takes quite a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.220 
the 80 gig hard drive takes quite a
while<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.440> load<00:02:56.770> up<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.850> read<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.570> it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
while to load up and read it and it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.350 
while to load up and read it and it
really<00:02:59.470> didn't<00:02:59.950> seem<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.280> too<00:03:00.310> usable<00:03:01.000> just

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
really didn't seem to be too usable just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.350 
really didn't seem to be too usable just
because<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.780> delays<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.310> hooked<00:03:03.700> up<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
because the delays so I hooked up the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.520 
because the delays so I hooked up the
two<00:03:04.390> gig<00:03:05.100> cruiser<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.850> very<00:03:06.940> fast<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
two gig cruiser and that is very fast it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.000 
two gig cruiser and that is very fast it
actually<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.670> USB<00:03:10.120> 1.1<00:03:10.780> port<00:03:11.380> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
actually it's a USB 1.1 port so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.920 
actually it's a USB 1.1 port so
transfers<00:03:12.880> aren't<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.180> fast<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.660> just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.630 

okay<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.440> actual<00:04:28.830> cable<00:04:29.220> itself

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
okay this is the actual cable itself

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.690 
okay this is the actual cable itself
it's<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.270> TC<00:04:30.750> four<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.410> one<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:32.520> comes<00:04:32.790> with<00:04:33.570> a

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
it's a TC four and one you comes with a

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.060 
it's a TC four and one you comes with a
HTC<00:04:35.700> vga<00:04:36.150> out<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:37.140> has<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.800> end

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
HTC vga out it just has this end

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.670 
HTC vga out it just has this end
connector<00:04:38.790> on<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.180> comes<00:04:39.480> by<00:04:40.110> default<00:04:40.500> in

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
connector on it that comes by default in

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.010 
connector on it that comes by default in
the<00:04:40.740> package<00:04:41.220> then<00:04:41.910> as<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.480> can<00:04:42.600> see<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:42.870> this

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
the package then as you can see on this

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.380 
the package then as you can see on this
end<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.710> HTC<00:04:44.130> proprietary<00:04:44.880> report<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
end is the HTC proprietary report that

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.960 
end is the HTC proprietary report that
goes<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.260> side<00:04:46.560> above<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> mini<00:04:47.790> USB

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
goes in on the side above the mini USB

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.650 
goes in on the side above the mini USB
port<00:04:48.570> on<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.350> HTC<00:04:49.710> advantage<00:04:50.420> so<00:04:51.420> there's<00:04:51.600> a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
port on the HTC advantage so there's a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.320 
port on the HTC advantage so there's a
look<00:04:51.990> at<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.200> full<00:04:52.410> cable<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.160> about<00:04:54.060> five

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
look at the full cable it's about five

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.420 
look at the full cable it's about five
inch<00:04:54.540> cable<00:04:54.960> or<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.860> now<00:04:56.040> this<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
inch cable or so so now this is the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.520 
inch cable or so so now this is the
