because<00:00:43.980> I've<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.309> growing<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.670> dead<00:00:44.850> orbit

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
because I've been growing in dead orbit

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.170 
because I've been growing in dead orbit
for<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:46.050> 10<00:00:46.379> months<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.399> 100<00:00:47.820> ranks

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
for about 10 months well over 100 ranks

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
for about 10 months well over 100 ranks
and<00:00:48.870> it'd<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> long<00:00:49.440> time<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> get

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and it'd take me a long time to get

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.590 
and it'd take me a long time to get
anything<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.670> dead<00:00:50.879> orbit<00:00:51.120> i<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.539> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
particular factions for the taken king

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
particular factions for the taken king
or<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:12.030> new<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> factions<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
or if you're new to factions if you have

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
or if you're new to factions if you have
been<00:01:13.320> grindin<00:01:13.650> factions<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:14.970> till

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
been grindin factions kind of up till

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
been grindin factions kind of up till
now<00:01:15.299> i<00:01:15.540> guess<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> 10<00:01:16.439> king<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
now i guess in the 10 king there's a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
now i guess in the 10 king there's a
much<00:01:17.460> better<00:01:17.640> reason<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
much better reason to do it because of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
much better reason to do it because of
the<00:01:19.110> allegiances<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the allegiances but also because of that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880 
the allegiances but also because of that
improved<00:01:21.150> loot<00:01:21.570> drops<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.830> that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
improved loot drops as well so that's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020 
improved loot drops as well so that's
pretty<00:01:23.130> cool<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> let<00:01:23.580> me<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:23.970> below

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
pretty cool so let me know down below
