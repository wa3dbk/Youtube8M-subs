00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.100
 what's up my brother comes to me and we're 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.760
 here in a game of these that so much 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.279
 like it 's an indie and dj game but that the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.740
 from mario if it's mario but first 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.840
 person is to put us in the role of mario 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.970
 but as if we were inside his 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.250
 body we have to go is for about 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 totally linear scenarios because 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.540
 Mario is linear because he is clumsy but 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.940
 we see from here and now what 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.760
 Let's see inside his low so 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.739
 let's go there let's play and let's see 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.570
 How about we had the time as always 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.120
 I will leave in the description for everything 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.339
 whoever wants to take it and get it off 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.530
 and play and as it is we have three 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.390
 rows as you see down here on the right 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.390
 to see our characters 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.399
 it's complicated because of course we 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.900
 we are used to it 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.900
 we can not turn the camera or anything 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 and 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.899
 There is the truth that you have to go looking 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:27.969
 the truth that seems not but it is I do not know no 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:32.649
 he 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.649
 this space to highlight the control 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.670
 here we are going to take a coin and already 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:06.130
 I tell you , come on, I know it's a little weird 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:15.060
 but the truth 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 here the same secret but I think I think that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.370
 can not not reach if I'm not I'm not in 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.120
 great was a life and I hope to jump 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.769
 sing mario hits me we can with the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 second life and as always mario 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.280
 we started from the beginning I say 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.819
 it's a bit difficult, you have to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.819
 Get used 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.240
 but 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 and out there 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.290
 everything is controlled 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.440
 and it is very difficult because I want 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.360
 look ahead but my eyes look at the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.680
 side because a lot easier than looking 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.099
 for so much but now I'm going to do it 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.099
 looking 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.460
 but jumps 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.200
 this year in the first person is a 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.960
 madness but a very big madness 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.850
 we escape for another we go for another good 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.970
 let's go with the second attempt let's see 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.420
 How are we doing? Come on, let's go there now 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.640
 our mission will be to get to the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.830
 tower is worth towards the flag to arrive healthy 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.010
 and saved we will stop investigating 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.010
 below up for all 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.890
 touch a touch and more 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.860
 here 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:25.370
 but we can not put out what it was 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.390
 to die bandit mushrooms 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.690
 an arrival 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.560
 I want to get there 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.319
 not the zapillo but not but good 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.770
 we are here in the end we will get 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.770
 in the end 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.879
 it's not until much earlier but it 's okay 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.069
 we have committed what I wanted 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.500
 get to the end of the first flag and 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.030
 let's continue until he kills me not only 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.039
 a life we have let's imagine what 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.979
 we have a life and we are going to go as 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.620
 I say is the whole first phase is here 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.300
 put in first person and is super 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.449
 funny super fun this 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.449
 get on the skin 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.449
 move away 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.490
 and let's run all the rent 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.389
 outside 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.490
 and this lie 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:29.630
 and well we will leave it here 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.760
 I hope you liked it and if you like it 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.340
 whether it's supporting with the may light the 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.810
 I appreciate a lot so I put it in 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.880

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.880
