00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.040 
audio probably could a shrink wrap that
a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.700> closer<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.750> they<00:02:27.870> did<00:02:28.020> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
a little closer because and they did a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.930 
a little closer because and they did a
nice<00:02:28.230> job<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.710> ribbon<00:02:29.040> cable<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.640> front

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
nice job on a ribbon cable for the front

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.670 
nice job on a ribbon cable for the front
panel<00:02:30.150> put<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.140> better<00:02:31.230> job<00:02:31.500> there

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
panel put in a little better job there

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.230 
panel put in a little better job there
but<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.640> spot<00:02:32.910> where<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
but it's going to be in a spot where you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.270 
but it's going to be in a spot where you
probably<00:02:33.600> won't<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.200> very<00:02:34.380> much<00:02:34.620> too<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
probably won't see it very much too and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.740 
probably won't see it very much too and
this<00:02:35.550> case<00:02:35.760> doesn't<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.210> window<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.600> this

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
this case doesn't have a window on this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
this case doesn't have a window on this
let's<00:02:36.960> talk<00:02:37.140> about<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.530> real<00:02:37.770> quick<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
let's talk about that real quick the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.670 
let's talk about that real quick the
side<00:02:38.640> panel<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.990> top<00:02:40.170> panel<00:02:40.410> so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
side panel just like the top panel so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
side panel just like the top panel so
i'm<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.040> show<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.340> top<00:02:41.520> panel

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
i'm not going to show the top panel

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.670 
i'm not going to show the top panel
because<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.390> exactly<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.050> same<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
because this is exactly the same the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.560 
because this is exactly the same the
side<00:02:43.860> panel<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.670> same<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.120> stealth

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
side panel we have the same like stealth

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.910 
side panel we have the same like stealth
door<00:02:47.300> technology<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.900> pops<00:02:49.110> off<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.770> you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
door technology it just pops off and you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.580 
door technology it just pops off and you
got<00:02:50.070> some<00:02:50.310> foam<00:02:51.270> padding<00:02:51.750> back<00:02:51.930> there<00:02:52.200> you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
got some foam padding back there you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.470 
got some foam padding back there you
know<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.920> thing<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> lot<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> newer

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
know one thing that a lot of the newer

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.360 
know one thing that a lot of the newer
cases<00:02:54.990> have<00:02:55.170> been<00:02:55.200> seeing<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:55.950> these

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
cases have been seeing is that these

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.280 
cases have been seeing is that these
push<00:02:56.700> points<00:02:57.240> have<00:02:57.420> been<00:02:57.450> broken<00:02:58.080> that's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
push points have been broken that's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.000
