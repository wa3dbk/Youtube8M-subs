00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.899
 yeah 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are here gathered in the region of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.099
 spa francorchamps in the ardennes 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 Belgian for the first presentation to 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.869
 the French press of our new 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.730
 range and efs tried with daf range 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 euro 6 we are going to have an identity 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.099
 extremely recognizable visual a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 design that both at the service of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.030
 aerodynamics for performance in 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 terms of economy to service also 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.489
 Radiator cooling and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.290
 motor a bumper made of galvanized steel 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.699
 new lighting with fires 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.129
 day to day dipped beam headlamps 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.870
 help also optional and for all 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 security corners are called in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.110
 like who are angel hair who 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.710
 allow two nights to have a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.710
 very very good visibility 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.910
 concerning gearboxes and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.220
 well we have the boxes of course 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.670
 manual but one thing that is very 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.820
 important is our new box 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.730
 automated 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.590
 it's the s tronic of edf with 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.160
 specific features 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.430
 adam such as the jc that allows to have 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.710
 precise and comfortable control of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.740
 maneuver at low speed but 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.470
 also fast shift that makes him 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 switch reports very quickly and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.990
 almost without breaking a load of a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.780
 fuel economy is also the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.510
 corollas that piloted electronically 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.760
 maximizes energy use 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.920
 kinetics that is stored in the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.590
 vehicle while they are moving this 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.540
 on the low descent so for 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.250
 cf and xf students we will find the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.780
 same flying with a lot of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 features steering wheel 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.690
 the on-board computer that's called the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.430
 ip at daf with new 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.630
 features to track well 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 the use of the vehicle 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.110
 we will also find on the whole 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.330
 from the range the dpa 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 because the dpa is the powerful driver 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.320
 assistant which is an extremely tool 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.580
 fun for our driver since that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.590
 is going to be a multi in quotation marks 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.229
 coaching for them to determine themselves a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.600
 consumption goal for good 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.490
 anticipated so it'll be a tool 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.020
 extra for us 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.300
 deposit module leads so there too a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.210
 novelty on the whole range 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.350
 driving the new cf is one thing that 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.620
 highlights the progress 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.510
 in terms of sound of this country it 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.280
 there is already the fan that makes a lot 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
 less noise since it snaps 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.890
 about 50% less time than for 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 st oral but mostly it is the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.070
 closed floor a contrario of the 85 euro 5 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.710
 who typing him ch and more green in the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.630
 meaning where the shifter go to 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.100
 through the boards and also 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 to have an encapsulation of the engine that 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.260
 is hanging on the floor and no longer 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.750
 plated on the floor and that's what 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.470
 makes all the difference in this new 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.470
 cr 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.439
 we have mounted in quality our range 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.840
 must be upgraded in quality 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.730
 skills of our network which is very 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.799

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.140
 it is to be certain that with

 industrial vehicle to heart so that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.200
 the vehicle is most often on the 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.000
 used road and very important thing 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.709
