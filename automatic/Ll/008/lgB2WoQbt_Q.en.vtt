so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.990> tell<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> gap<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.250> be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so you can tell where the gap will be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 
so you can tell where the gap will be
once<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.030> clip<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.450> installed<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.500> will

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
once the clip is installed this will

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
once the clip is installed this will
depend<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> engine<00:01:44.640> manufacturers

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
depend on the engine manufacturers

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
depend on the engine manufacturers
directions<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.950> won't<00:01:47.220> always<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
directions it won't always be with the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
directions it won't always be with the
gap<00:01:48.509> facing<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> top<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> piston<00:01:50.329> now

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
gap facing the top of the piston now

here's<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> big<00:01:51.869> secret<00:01:52.159> one<00:01:53.159> end<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
here's the big secret one end of the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
here's the big secret one end of the
clip<00:01:54.030> sits<00:01:54.420> higher<00:01:54.720> than<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> other<00:01:55.259> which

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
clip sits higher than the other which

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
clip sits higher than the other which
means<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> ends<00:01:56.759> overlap<00:01:57.270> each<00:01:57.479> other<00:01:57.659> when

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
means the ends overlap each other when

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
means the ends overlap each other when
the<00:01:58.229> installer<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.799> pushed<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.610> sleeve

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the installer is pushed into the sleeve

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.350 
the installer is pushed into the sleeve
like<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.520> now<00:02:02.520> push<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> little<00:02:03.329> further

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
like so now push it in a little further

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 
like so now push it in a little further
and<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.189> ends<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and you can see how the two ends of the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.990 
and you can see how the two ends of the
c-clip<00:02:05.880> begin<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> overlap<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.580> finally<00:02:08.580> keep

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
c-clip begin to overlap and finally keep

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
c-clip begin to overlap and finally keep
on<00:02:09.209> pushing<00:02:09.629> until<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.050> c-clip<00:02:10.500> snaps<00:02:10.830> into

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
on pushing until the c-clip snaps into

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.110 
on pushing until the c-clip snaps into
place

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and that's all there is to it just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
and that's all there is to it just
repeat<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.269> same<00:02:15.450> procedure<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> second
