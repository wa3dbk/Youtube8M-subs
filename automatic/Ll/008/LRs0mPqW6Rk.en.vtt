00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
but of course that's a very temporary

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.250 
but of course that's a very temporary
situation<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.389> so<00:00:15.389> over<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.809> years<00:00:15.900> I've

situation and so over the years I've
been<00:00:16.350> looking<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.480> substitute<00:00:18.480> materials

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
been looking for substitute materials

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.500 
been looking for substitute materials

today<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.460> paper<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> my

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
today this paper is really one of my

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.819 
today this paper is really one of my
absolute<00:00:28.289> favorites<00:00:33.230> let's<00:00:34.230> start<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
absolute favorites let's start with a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.580 
absolute favorites let's start with a
real<00:00:34.980> cake<00:00:35.660> which<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.440> back

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
real cake which you know is going back

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
real cake which you know is going back
to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> medium<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> refer<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to the medium I really want to refer to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.500 
to the medium I really want to refer to
in<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.170> case<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.680> made<00:00:41.300> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
in this case I made kind of a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
in this case I made kind of a
combination<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.320> royal<00:00:43.649> icing<00:00:43.829> buttercream

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
combination of royal icing buttercream

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
combination of royal icing buttercream
with<00:00:44.789> egg<00:00:44.910> whites<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.480> butter<00:00:45.770> that<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
with egg whites and butter that really

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.200 
with egg whites and butter that really
got<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.360> stiff<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.920> hard<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.969> let<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
got very stiff and and hard if I let it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.470 
got very stiff and and hard if I let it
set<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> week<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:54.000> built

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
set up for like a week and then I built

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.350 
set up for like a week and then I built
a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.860> structure<00:00:55.860> around<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.550> poured

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
a little structure around it and poured

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.389 
a little structure around it and poured
the<00:00:57.539> silicone<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> over<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> cake<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the silicone into that over the cake and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
the silicone into that over the cake and
flipped<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.239> took<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> cake<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
flipped it out took the cake out and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:18.680 
flipped it out took the cake out and
then<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.559> had<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.309> mode<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> used

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.630 

I'm<00:01:19.080> thinking<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.370> about

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I'm thinking actually very much about

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.690 
I'm thinking actually very much about
modernist<00:01:21.240> sculpture<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> case

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
modernist sculpture it's really a case

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
modernist sculpture it's really a case
of<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.880> guess<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.950> inappropriate

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of I guess using a very inappropriate

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.290 
of I guess using a very inappropriate
material<00:01:30.860> which<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> why<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.520> degree<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
material which is why a degree of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.420 
material which is why a degree of
verisimilitude<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.380> important<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.040> these

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
verisimilitude is important if these

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
verisimilitude is important if these
things<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.470> standard

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
things just look like your standard

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340 
things just look like your standard
elements<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> modernist<00:01:38.790> sculpture<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:40.230> know

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
elements of modernist sculpture you know

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
elements of modernist sculpture you know
sort<00:01:40.620> of<00:01:40.680> piled<00:01:41.160> up<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.910> abra<00:01:42.120> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
sort of piled up thing all abra and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.940 
sort of piled up thing all abra and
kuusi<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> stand<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.160> gallery<00:01:44.370> space

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
kuusi on a on a stand in a gallery space

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
kuusi on a on a stand in a gallery space
then<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.970> feel<00:01:48.150> like<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.360> stretching

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
then I don't feel like I'm stretching

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.010 
then I don't feel like I'm stretching
that<00:01:49.350> thought<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.480> once<00:01:51.480> it's<00:01:51.690> it's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that thought but once it's it's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
that thought but once it's it's
something<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.800> unexpected<00:01:53.760> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something so unexpected and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
something so unexpected and
inappropriate<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.570> cake<00:01:54.900> that's<00:01:55.710> being

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
inappropriate like cake that's being

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.430 
inappropriate like cake that's being
used<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.300> way<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.870> then<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> gets

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
used in that way then then it gets

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.340 
used in that way then then it gets
interesting<00:01:58.650> for<00:01:59.070> me<00:01:59.160> I<00:01:59.370> think<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.210> lot<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> what

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
interesting for me I think a lot of what

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.250 
interesting for me I think a lot of what
we<00:02:01.470> consider<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.010> classic<00:02:02.610> cake

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
we consider to be classic cake

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.950 
we consider to be classic cake
decorating<00:02:04.260> shapes<00:02:05.360> are<00:02:06.360> coming<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.870> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
decorating shapes are coming out of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.969 
decorating shapes are coming out of
neoclassical<00:02:07.500> architecture<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.950> again<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
neoclassical architecture and again I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.830 
neoclassical architecture and again I
love<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.520> mismatch<00:02:12.000> between<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
love the mismatch between that and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
love the mismatch between that and
modernist<00:02:15.890> sculpting<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.220> my<00:02:17.430> cake

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
modernist sculpting if my cake

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.380 
modernist sculpting if my cake
decorating<00:02:18.330> gets<00:02:18.570> too<00:02:18.810> perfect<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:20.820> starts<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
decorating gets too perfect it starts to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.670 
decorating gets too perfect it starts to
look<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:22.280> architectural<00:02:23.280> elements<00:02:24.680> which

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
look like architectural elements which

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.080 
look like architectural elements which
is<00:02:25.830> actually<00:02:26.160> why<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.670> there<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:26.880> once

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
is actually why I get in there and once

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.430 
is actually why I get in there and once
once<00:02:27.330> I've<00:02:27.450> decorated<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.930> whole<00:02:28.020> cake<00:02:28.260> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
once I've decorated the whole cake I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.360 
once I've decorated the whole cake I
don't<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.739> can<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.040> some<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.250> these

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
don't know if you can see some of these

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
don't know if you can see some of these
things<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.790> I'll<00:02:30.000> pick<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.750> thing<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.020> with

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
things but I'll pick the thing up with

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.979 
things but I'll pick the thing up with
my<00:02:31.320> hands<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.890> smash<00:02:32.420> some<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
my hands and smash some of the the

something<00:02:36.900> more<00:02:37.080> about<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.440> material<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
something more about the material that

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.820 
something more about the material that
this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> soft<00:02:38.700> material<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.239> fluffy

because<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> look<00:02:41.430> around<00:02:41.640> at

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
because you know if you look around at

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850 
because you know if you look around at
architecture<00:02:42.000> you'll<00:02:42.450> see<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.810> same<00:02:43.050> kind<00:02:43.709> of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
architecture you'll see the same kind of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.520 
architecture you'll see the same kind of
swags<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.360> these<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.050> carved

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
swags and so on on these like carved

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.620 
swags and so on on these like carved
stone<00:02:46.920> garden<00:02:47.580> urns<00:02:48.860> things<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.070> are<00:02:50.630> very

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
stone garden urns things that are very

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.320 
stone garden urns things that are very
not<00:02:51.840> cake<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.380> they're<00:02:52.560> very<00:02:52.830> hard<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.700> if

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
not cake like they're very hard and if

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.300 
not cake like they're very hard and if
this<00:02:54.600> whole<00:02:54.870> stack<00:02:55.410> wound<00:02:55.800> up<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.040> looking

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
this whole stack wound up just looking

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
this whole stack wound up just looking
like<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.940> wouldn't<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.630> happy<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.050> that

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
like that I wouldn't be happy with that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.170 
like that I wouldn't be happy with that
either<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.500> want<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.070> have<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.640> lot<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
either I want it to really have a lot of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:17.390 
either I want it to really have a lot of
that<00:03:00.390> softness<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.730 

you<00:03:18.400> know<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.670> figures<00:03:19.000> came<00:03:19.600> in<00:03:19.810> there<00:03:19.990> in

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
you know the figures came in there in

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.210 
you know the figures came in there in
the<00:03:20.830> beginning<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.310> as<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:23.530> way<00:03:23.800> for<00:03:24.070> me

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the beginning just as a as a way for me

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.250 
the beginning just as a as a way for me
of<00:03:24.370> solidifying<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.030> relationship<00:03:25.720> that

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
of solidifying that relationship that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.970 
of solidifying that relationship that
this<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:27.930> visible<00:03:28.930> place<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:29.740> cuz<00:03:29.920> I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
this is a visible place you know cuz I

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.800 
this is a visible place you know cuz I
was<00:03:30.100> painting<00:03:30.340> these<00:03:31.060> landscapes<00:03:31.330> for<00:03:31.780> a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
was painting these landscapes for a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.090 
was painting these landscapes for a
while<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.110> were<00:03:32.170> made<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.410> cakes<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.800> sweets

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
while that were made of cakes and sweets

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.500 
while that were made of cakes and sweets
and<00:03:35.910> occasionally<00:03:36.910> I'd<00:03:37.030> noticed<00:03:37.360> there's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
and occasionally I'd noticed there's

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.100 
and occasionally I'd noticed there's
some<00:03:37.690> confusion<00:03:38.100> some<00:03:39.100> scale<00:03:39.430> confusion<00:03:40.110> like

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
some confusion some scale confusion like

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.150 
some confusion some scale confusion like
people<00:03:41.380> would<00:03:41.440> look<00:03:41.650> at<00:03:41.740> them<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:41.860> say<00:03:42.040> oh

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
people would look at them and say oh

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.950 
people would look at them and say oh
wing<00:03:42.550> tebow<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.240> you<00:03:43.390> know<00:03:43.480> Wayne<00:03:43.630> t-bones

wing tebow and you know Wayne t-bones

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.720 
wing tebow and you know Wayne t-bones
painting<00:03:44.260> still<00:03:44.740> lives<00:03:44.950> when<00:03:45.490> he's<00:03:45.580> not

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
painting still lives when he's not

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.510 
painting still lives when he's not
painting<00:03:45.940> actual<00:03:46.390> landscapes<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:48.160> never

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
painting actual landscapes and I never

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.740 
painting actual landscapes and I never
thought<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.850> those<00:03:48.970> things<00:03:49.210> as<00:03:49.420> small<00:03:49.720> I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
thought of those things as small I

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.140 
thought of those things as small I
thought<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.110> most<00:03:50.230> big<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.460> just<00:03:51.790> wanted<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
thought it most big so I just wanted to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.880 
thought it most big so I just wanted to
stick<00:03:52.480> some<00:03:52.630> figures<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.230> essentially

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
stick some figures in there essentially

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.640 
stick some figures in there essentially
for<00:03:54.220> scale<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.690> say<00:03:55.870> look<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.410> know

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
for scale and and to say look you know

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.260 
for scale and and to say look you know
this<00:03:56.800> could<00:03:57.100> be<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.550> this<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.240> a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
this could be you this is this is a

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.120 
this could be you this is this is a
person<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.140> place<00:03:59.350> it's<00:03:59.680> totally

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
person in this place it's totally

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.199 
person in this place it's totally
immersive<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:03.610> talking<00:04:04.000> more<00:04:04.150> about

the<00:04:04.420> question<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.459> what<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.580> might<00:04:06.730> be<00:04:06.910> like<00:04:06.940> to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
the question of what it might be like to

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.590 
the question of what it might be like to
live<00:04:08.590> in<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.950> sweet<00:04:09.610> utopia<00:04:10.060> like<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.570> a

place where all your desires are being
fulfilled<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.140> time<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.540> they

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
fulfilled all the time I know that they

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.000 
fulfilled all the time I know that they
were<00:04:17.430> read<00:04:18.430> simultaneously<00:04:19.359> as<00:04:20.010> potentially

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
were read simultaneously as potentially

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.810 
were read simultaneously as potentially
other<00:04:21.160> objects<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:21.910> desire<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.460> that's<00:04:24.669> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
other objects of desire in that that's a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.280 
other objects of desire in that that's a
reading<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.300> I'm<00:04:25.419> still<00:04:25.720> not<00:04:25.750> entirely

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
reading that I'm still not entirely

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.170 
reading that I'm still not entirely
comfortable<00:04:26.650> with<00:04:26.980> myself<00:04:27.580> because<00:04:27.970> that's

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
comfortable with myself because that's

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.650 
comfortable with myself because that's
not<00:04:28.419> really<00:04:28.750> what<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.900> was<00:04:29.020> thinking

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.780 

I<00:04:36.580> was<00:04:37.580> actually<00:04:37.760> skeptical<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.570> said<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.530> know

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
I was actually skeptical I said you know

Prince yeah we live in an age of
mechanical<00:04:44.390> reproduction<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.530> don't

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
mechanical reproduction I don't

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.100 
mechanical reproduction I don't
understand<00:04:46.190> what's<00:04:46.910> special<00:04:47.360> about<00:04:47.660> this

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
understand what's special about this

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.430 
understand what's special about this
very<00:04:48.980> old<00:04:49.160> process<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.600> makes<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.020> relevant

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
very old process that makes it relevant

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.360 
very old process that makes it relevant
