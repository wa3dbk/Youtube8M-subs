car you normally use a prop shaft so
they<00:00:06.299> had<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.600> sort<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.049> out<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:08.690> in<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.870> bike

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
they had to sort that out to in the bike

Ian needed to work out how to change the
gears<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> engine<00:00:44.420> motorcyclists<00:00:45.420> move

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
gears on this engine motorcyclists move

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
gears on this engine motorcyclists move
through<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> gears<00:00:46.289> by<00:00:46.620> clicking<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> foot

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
through the gears by clicking a foot

pedal<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.739> but<00:00:49.739> Ian<00:00:50.070> wanted<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pedal up and down but Ian wanted to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
pedal up and down but Ian wanted to
mimic<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> feel<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.449> racing<00:00:51.870> car<00:00:52.140> which

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
mimic the feel of a racing car which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
mimic the feel of a racing car which
usually<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.340> fingertip<00:00:53.910> control<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
usually has fingertip control of the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
usually has fingertip control of the
gears<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.620> attached<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> cable<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
gears so he attached the cable from the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
gears so he attached the cable from the
gear<00:01:00.180> lever<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> bottom<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> engine

to a set of paddles behind the steering
wheel<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> effectively<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.720> pulling<00:01:07.460> on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
wheel so effectively we are pulling on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
wheel so effectively we are pulling on
either<00:01:08.729> side<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.570> effect<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> shift<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
either side to effect a shift from the

either side to effect a shift from the
wheel<00:01:10.979> position<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.000> even<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.110> hand<00:01:13.320> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
wheel position so even here the hand can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
wheel position so even here the hand can
still<00:01:14.210> reach<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> quite<00:01:18.299> clever

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
still reach this is quite clever

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
still reach this is quite clever
Ian's<00:01:19.259> managed<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> create<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> fingertip

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
Ian's managed to create the fingertip

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
gear control of a much more expensive

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.230 
gear control of a much more expensive
car<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:26.780> Ian's<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> problem<00:01:29.240> the

could help the engineers started by

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
could help the engineers started by
making<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.900> plastic<00:02:28.349> prototype<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.310> an<00:02:29.489> adapter

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
that would tilt the carburetors

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.070 
that would tilt the carburetors
downwards

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
so that just puts a stay on this would

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.080 
so that just puts a stay on this would
be<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> nice<00:02:41.080> close<00:02:42.080> fit

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090

to get the answer I think we're in

tonic<00:04:02.630> are<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:06.819> few<00:04:07.819> final<00:04:08.090> tweaks<00:04:08.360> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
tonic are a few final tweaks and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:56.900 
tonic are a few final tweaks and
everything<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.410> ready

actually it's just like I can't believe
I'm<00:05:02.610> actually<00:05:02.670> driving<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.480> was<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:04.440> mean<00:05:04.770> so

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
I'm actually driving it was I mean so

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
the tonic our is everything the lads

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.410 
the tonic our is everything the lads
hopeful<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:17.200> acceleration<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.040> Porsche

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
hopeful the acceleration of a Porsche

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
it's like oh god you know when you've

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.960 
it's like oh god you know when you've
done<00:05:43.470> something<00:05:43.530> for<00:05:44.010> so<00:05:44.160> long<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.820> just

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
done something for so long and you just

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.790 
done something for so long and you just
you<00:05:45.570> get<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.050> it's<00:05:46.260> better<00:05:46.530> than<00:05:46.680> you

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
you get in it it's better than you

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.440 
you get in it it's better than you
thought<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.160> would<00:05:47.250> be<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:48.060> just<00:05:48.270> don't

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
thought it would be and you just don't

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.300 
thought it would be and you just don't
want<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.810> break<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.260> but<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.889> just<00:05:49.919> want<00:05:50.250> to

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
want to break it but you just want to

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.430 
want to break it but you just want to
drive<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.669> so<00:05:50.880> much<00:05:51.120> faster<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.570> just<00:05:51.750> felt<00:05:51.930> so

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
drive it so much faster I just felt so

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.680 
drive it so much faster I just felt so
confident<00:05:52.860> really<00:05:53.400> easy<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.790> drive<00:05:54.000> code<00:05:54.330> it

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
confident really easy the drive code it

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.800 
confident really easy the drive code it
just<00:05:54.840> like<00:05:55.050> really<00:05:56.040> smooth<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:57.330> bloody<00:05:57.660> out
