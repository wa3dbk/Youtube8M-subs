00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.870 
cheating a little bit because as you
know<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> overlay<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.770> actually<00:02:13.280> lasts<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
know on the overlay it actually lasts a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.680 
know on the overlay it actually lasts a
little<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.270> longer<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.430> um<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.210> just<00:02:17.240> keep<00:02:17.540> in

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
little bit longer so um so just keep in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.840 
little bit longer so um so just keep in
mind<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.710> overlay<00:02:18.980> also<00:02:19.610> keep

in mind that I did go to the salon to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.180 
in mind that I did go to the salon to
get<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.850> done<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.290> professionally<00:02:24.980> done

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
now so all I'm going to do just put the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.970 
now so all I'm going to do just put the
top<00:02:28.700> coat<00:02:29.030> over<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.630> top<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.290> see<00:02:30.680> how

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
top coat over the top of it to see how

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.060 
top coat over the top of it to see how
much<00:02:31.010> longer<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.730> would<00:02:32.030> normally<00:02:32.270> last<00:02:33.070> or

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
much longer it would normally last or

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.040 
much longer it would normally last or
how<00:02:34.130> much<00:02:34.490> longer<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.030> will<00:02:35.180> last<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
how much longer it will last with the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
how much longer it will last with the
top<00:02:36.260> coat<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:36.950> without<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.550> top<00:02:37.730> coat<00:02:38.000> I

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
top coat now without the top coat I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.860 
top coat now without the top coat I
would<00:02:38.360> say<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:39.560> lasts<00:02:39.830> about<00:02:40.450> maybe<00:02:41.450> four<00:02:41.840> days

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870
