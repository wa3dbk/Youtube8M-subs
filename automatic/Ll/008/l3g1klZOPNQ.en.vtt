now<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> show<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.949> how<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> paint<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
now I'm going to show you how to paint a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.109 
now I'm going to show you how to paint a
rusty<00:00:17.789> old<00:00:17.820> metal<00:00:18.210> fence<00:00:19.760> now<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> need<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
rusty old metal fence now you need to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
rusty old metal fence now you need to
calculate<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:21.869> paint<00:00:22.170> you'll<00:00:22.320> need<00:00:22.470> by

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
calculate how much paint you'll need by

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
calculate how much paint you'll need by
multiplying<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> length<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:23.640> fence<00:00:23.910> by

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
multiplying the length of your fence by

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
multiplying the length of your fence by
the<00:00:24.240> height<00:00:24.590> by<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:26.130> you've<00:00:26.369> got

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the height by two because you've got

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.640 
the height by two because you've got
both<00:00:26.640> sides<00:00:26.910> now<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.779> paint<00:00:28.019> covers<00:00:28.320> 14

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
both sides now this paint covers 14

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
both sides now this paint covers 14
square<00:00:28.890> meters<00:00:29.189> per<00:00:29.220> liter<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.029> need<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
square meters per liter and you need to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
square meters per liter and you need to
divide<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.570> into<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:30.990> square<00:00:31.260> meter<00:00:31.470> each

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
divide that into your square meter each

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
divide that into your square meter each
and<00:00:31.830> that'll<00:00:32.099> give<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> liter<00:00:32.640> each<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and that'll give you a liter each that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.290 
and that'll give you a liter each that
you<00:00:33.180> need<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.079> fence<00:00:35.090> first<00:00:36.090> of
