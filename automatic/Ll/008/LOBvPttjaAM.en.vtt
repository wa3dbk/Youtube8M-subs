about<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:11.400> investor<00:04:12.400> has<00:04:12.580> been<00:04:12.880> brought

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
about it the investor has been brought

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.780 
about it the investor has been brought
down<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.360> little<00:04:13.630> bit<00:04:13.840> there<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.890> infested

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
down a little bit there the infested

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.729 
down a little bit there the infested
terrans<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.390> eggs<00:04:16.660> actually<00:04:17.260> have<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> hundred

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
terrans the eggs actually have a hundred

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.099 
terrans the eggs actually have a hundred
hit<00:04:17.890> points<00:04:18.250> but<00:04:18.640> now<00:04:18.790> they<00:04:18.970> only<00:04:19.150> have<00:04:19.359> 70<00:04:19.930> so

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
hit points but now they only have 70 so

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.370 
hit points but now they only have 70 so
a<00:04:20.169> 30<00:04:20.470> HP<00:04:20.980> has<00:04:21.910> been<00:04:22.120> taken<00:04:22.419> off<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.960> means

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
a 30 HP has been taken off so that means

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.110 
a 30 HP has been taken off so that means
storms<00:04:23.770> can<00:04:23.919> kill<00:04:24.130> them<00:04:24.250> in<00:04:24.370> one<00:04:24.850> shot

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
storms can kill them in one shot

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.420 
storms can kill them in one shot
upgraded<00:04:25.810> tanks<00:04:26.229> Colossus<00:04:26.890> can<00:04:27.100> shoot<00:04:27.310> them

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
upgraded tanks Colossus can shoot them

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.559 
upgraded tanks Colossus can shoot them
down<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.240> is

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
down so this is

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.629 
down so this is
important<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:29.770> that's<00:04:30.189> going<00:04:30.429> to<00:04:30.490> make<00:04:30.580> a

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
important and and that's going to make a

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.820 
important and and that's going to make a
big<00:04:30.789> difference<00:04:31.029> as<00:04:31.300> well<00:04:31.719> is<00:04:31.929> that<00:04:31.990> Raven<00:04:32.710> to

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
big difference as well is that Raven to

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.529 
big difference as well is that Raven to
