00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.969
 but I want the center to the circuit 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.219
 he must maintain that has gm 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.169
 he wants 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.419

 Gillet Silence The Decker just sat trading nec and tim curl are able 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.349
 not for nothing that people keep the rest after 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.710
 not as a mobile polling station 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.710
 I have a Russian rocket recently 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.509

 per loo meter 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.229
 there is no question here 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.279
 He is 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.289
 he turned out to be nothing 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.569

 hendriks newspaper recalls 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.839
 he scores and that doesn't appeal to anyone 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:55.809
 but part of them comes 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:58.159
 but apparently do at the moment

 He speaks of a woman in London 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.059
 hopefully six draws have not been observed 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.990
 you have already reached the speeds of five duels 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.759
 in the setting is fine
