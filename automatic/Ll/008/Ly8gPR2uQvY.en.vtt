 He has also done some type of hunting 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.140
 furtive 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.630
 the last year the seprona has stopped by 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.400
 furtivism to 50 people the fine for 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.890
 this type of infractions can reach 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.820
 more than five thousand euros and the withdrawal of 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 the letter license 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.230
 Monte Gorbea praises seven in the afternoon 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.989
 two male deer courts a female 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.320
 is the dispute marking territory with its 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 antlers 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 the females live isolated with their young 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.540
 next to two males between September and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.189
 October to mate and when 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 make the specimens more visible 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.740
 precious and robust that have survived 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 up to 12 years despite hunting despite 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.619
 of the poachers despite all the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 impediments then in this era is 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.380
 when they can see and when 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 furtive to try to hunt them for that in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.070
 these dates intensify the surveillance 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 it has come to detect groups 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.179
 organized some of eastern countries 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 that can take only 10 minutes in 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.380
 sacrifice the animal and take the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.539
 trophy first they will look at the animal 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 even with days of alteration and 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.799
 subsequently, the person appears 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.069
 that somehow then he hunts him not 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.069
 hunt 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 is to let you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.479
 what is it kills the animal we go for a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.479
 evil 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.860
 0 inform absorbed returning to 64 and 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.620
 return to 72 we perform a control of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.120
 true preventive controls 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 nocturnal are duplicated because 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.080
 crops act especially night 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 agents for vehicles that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.190
 they cross forest tracks and review 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.050
 porters if they find weapons or 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.170
 objects like these vision telescopes 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.170
 night 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.980
 they always use places where there 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.860
 Departures 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.599
 or escape route and if there may be more than 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.670
 a better that's why the devices that 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.450
 they ride at night they always ride with 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 various resources 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.630
 the fine for furtive varies depending on 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.400
 the seriousness of the infraction but can 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.970
 be lower than the price of some 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.250
 trophies in the market what legally 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.080
 It would cost to hunt, for example 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.270
 mountain goats in the peninsular center 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.760
 They can range from prices 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.060
 affordable thousand euros or 1,200 up 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.400
 there are trophies of great bounded where 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.290
 the best have been sold for 60,000 the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 tense deer population three times 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.540
 a year and the quota for the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.670
 legal hunting every weekend and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 we control the catches that will give two 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.700
 quotas but also we also inform and 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.060
 we document all those casualties that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.740
 detected by poaching in the last year 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.000
 in Spain 50 have been practiced 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.000
 arrests for poaching
