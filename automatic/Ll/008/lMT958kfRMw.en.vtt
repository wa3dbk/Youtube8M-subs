good use to help the students find these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.779 
good use to help the students find these
essential<00:00:20.779> patterns<00:00:21.310> looking<00:00:22.310> at<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.580> Pink

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
essential patterns looking at the Pink

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.460 
essential patterns looking at the Pink
Panther<00:00:23.210> we<00:00:23.359> find<00:00:23.599> that<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:23.869> essentially<00:00:24.349> an

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
Panther we find that it's essentially an

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.460 
Panther we find that it's essentially an
e<00:00:24.710> minor<00:00:25.009> chord<00:00:25.519> and<00:00:25.910> then<00:00:26.750> what<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.080> move<00:00:27.320> to

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
e minor chord and then what is a move to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.800 
e minor chord and then what is a move to
the<00:00:27.560> next<00:00:27.679> to<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.039> C<00:00:28.250> major<00:00:28.550> chord<00:00:28.820> back<00:00:29.509> and

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
the next to the C major chord back and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.960 
the next to the C major chord back and
forth<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:30.380> he<00:00:30.830> does<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:31.130> very<00:00:31.400> brilliantly

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
steps notice the alternating bass I'm

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.670 
steps notice the alternating bass I'm

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.720 

but<00:00:47.680> we<00:00:47.800> can<00:00:47.920> give<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.130> a<00:00:48.160> little<00:00:48.220> more<00:00:48.490> pizzazz

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
but we can give it a little more pizzazz

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.200 
but we can give it a little more pizzazz
by<00:00:49.210> giving<00:00:49.540> an<00:00:49.630> accent<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.670> other<00:00:51.940> words<00:00:52.120> this

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
by giving an accent in other words this

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.900 
by giving an accent in other words this

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:33.980 

you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.749 

now<00:01:34.990> we're<00:01:35.350> looking<00:01:35.469> at<00:01:35.770> E<00:01:35.979> minor<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.520> C

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
now we're looking at E minor and C

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.809 
now we're looking at E minor and C
notice<00:01:37.329> sometimes<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.020> says<00:01:38.170> C<00:01:38.439> seven<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.640> this

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
notice sometimes it says C seven so this

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.240 
notice sometimes it says C seven so this
is<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.119> chance<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.719> make<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.469> little<00:01:41.979> more

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
is the chance to make this a little more

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.819 
is the chance to make this a little more
spicy<00:01:43.090> with<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.659> seventh<00:01:44.109> we've<00:01:44.439> got<00:01:44.560> an<00:01:44.679> F

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
seven in there also but staying with our

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.069 
seven in there also but staying with our
C<00:01:47.649> seven<00:01:47.819> for<00:01:48.819> the<00:01:48.969> improv<00:01:49.329> section<00:01:49.899> let's

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
C seven for the improv section let's

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.469 
C seven for the improv section let's
make<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.259> really<00:01:50.950> spicy<00:01:51.250> by<00:01:51.670> not<00:01:51.880> only<00:01:52.119> adding

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
make it really spicy by not only adding

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.139 
make it really spicy by not only adding
a<00:01:52.719> skip<00:01:53.079> up<00:01:53.289> for<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.740> seventh<00:01:54.280> but<00:01:54.729> let's<00:01:54.880> skip

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
a skip up for the seventh but let's skip

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.080 
a skip up for the seventh but let's skip
up<00:01:55.329> again<00:01:55.689> for<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:55.990> ninth<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.640> good<00:01:57.849> way<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
up again for the ninth and a good way to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.940 
up again for the ninth and a good way to
play<00:01:58.299> this<00:01:58.569> as<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> piano<00:01:59.200> since<00:01:59.560> we<00:01:59.649> can't

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
play this as a piano since we can't

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.979 
play this as a piano since we can't
really<00:02:00.250> take<00:02:00.459> such<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.819> big<00:02:01.119> handful<00:02:01.629> of<00:02:01.750> notes

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989 
really take such a big handful of notes

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.550 
really take such a big handful of notes
is<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.770> think<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.489> c9<00:02:04.090> chord<00:02:04.569> in<00:02:05.409> its

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
is to think of this c9 chord in its

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.709 
is to think of this c9 chord in its
upper<00:02:05.979> structure<00:02:06.340> here<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.789> really<00:02:07.030> G<00:02:07.450> minor

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
upper structure here is really G minor

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.710 
upper structure here is really G minor
isn't<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.280> put<00:02:09.579> C<00:02:09.849> in<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.060> left<00:02:10.299> hand<00:02:10.539> and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
isn't it so I put C in the left hand and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780 
isn't it so I put C in the left hand and
I<00:02:10.869> invert<00:02:11.230> my<00:02:11.440> g<00:02:11.739> minor<00:02:12.010> chord

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
I invert my g minor chord

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.150 
I invert my g minor chord
I<00:02:12.819> get<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:14.049> simple<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.680> easy<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.129> use

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
I get very simple and easy to use

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.390 
I get very simple and easy to use
voicings<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.269> c9<00:02:16.720> chord<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:18.040> could<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
voicings of a c9 chord we could do this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400 
voicings of a c9 chord we could do this
on<00:02:18.610> some<00:02:18.790> other<00:02:18.940> chords<00:02:19.780> also<00:02:20.110> what<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.349> we

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
on some other chords also what if we

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.130 
on some other chords also what if we
took<00:02:20.590> our<00:02:20.769> E<00:02:20.920> minor<00:02:21.129> both<00:02:21.970> D<00:02:22.120> E<00:02:22.150> minor<00:02:22.510> seven

took our E minor both D E minor seven

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.400 
took our E minor both D E minor seven
had<00:02:23.920> another<00:02:24.250> skip<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.049> here<00:02:26.049> we<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.200> with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
had another skip and here we are with

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.020 
had another skip and here we are with
the<00:02:26.709> minor<00:02:27.069> overni<00:02:29.519> interesting<00:02:30.519> sounds<00:02:30.910> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the minor overni interesting sounds is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:41.089 
the minor overni interesting sounds is
it

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.440 

in<00:02:42.099> other<00:02:42.310> words<00:02:42.489> suddenly<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.879> sounds<00:02:43.180> very

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
in other words suddenly it sounds very

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.290 
in other words suddenly it sounds very
jazzy<00:02:43.930> because<00:02:44.800> I'm<00:02:44.920> taking<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.640> cord<00:02:46.030> that's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
jazzy because I'm taking the cord that's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.070
