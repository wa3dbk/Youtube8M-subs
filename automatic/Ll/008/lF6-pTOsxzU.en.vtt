flush with the day but as magicians
you'll<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.680> thinking<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.879> cat<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you'll probably thinking that the cat is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
you'll probably thinking that the cat is
now<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.510> top<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> deck<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.980> you'd<00:01:02.160> be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
now on top of the deck and you'd be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.529 
now on top of the deck and you'd be
right<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> fitness<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
right to fitness but you can see for a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
right to fitness but you can see for a
fact<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> card<00:01:04.260> isn't<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.650> top<00:01:04.860> glutes<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
fact that the card isn't on top glutes a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.399 
fact that the card isn't on top glutes a
seven<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.519> clubs<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:06.630> maybe<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.170> could<00:01:07.290> be

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
seven of clubs well maybe you could be

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.630 
seven of clubs well maybe you could be
thinking<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> cards<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> second

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
thinking at the cards in the second

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
thinking at the cards in the second
position<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.540> sometimes<00:01:09.990> control

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
position because we do sometimes control

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
position because we do sometimes control
car<00:01:10.590> second<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> top<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:13.470> look

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
car second to the top but you look

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.810 
car second to the top but you look
siting<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:13.920> either<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
siting there either because that's the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.850 
siting there either because that's the
ten<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> hearts<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
ten of hearts so as you can see for a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
ten of hearts so as you can see for a
fax<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.580> cat<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.939> nowhere<00:01:18.270> near<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
cool trick how about if I could cut

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
cool trick how about if I could cut
straight<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:24.090> collection<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.750> six<00:01:24.930> dams

with that pretty cool we'll give it a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.289 
with that pretty cool we'll give it a
