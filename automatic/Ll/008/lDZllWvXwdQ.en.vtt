pads like a pure track talent I was

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.899 
pads like a pure track talent I was
getting<00:01:09.020> very<00:01:09.290> very<00:01:09.740> low<00:01:10.010> tracking<00:01:10.580> speeds

getting very very low tracking speeds

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.940 
getting very very low tracking speeds
and<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:11.240> would<00:01:11.360> freak<00:01:11.659> out<00:01:11.780> all<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.320> time<00:01:12.530> when

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
and it would freak out all the time when

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.710

I<00:01:12.979> say<00:01:13.189> freak<00:01:13.460> out<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.820> mean<00:01:14.000> this<00:01:14.180> mouse<00:01:14.420> would

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
I say freak out I mean this mouse would

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
I say freak out I mean this mouse would
be<00:01:14.869> like<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.049> first-generation<00:01:15.560> laser<00:01:16.159> sensor

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700
