00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
he uses stealth rock which is really

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.240 
he uses stealth rock which is really
cool<00:02:26.330> because<00:02:26.560> focus<00:02:27.560> punch<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.920> not<00:02:28.099> only

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
game it was a bit borderline who would

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.300 
game it was a bit borderline who would
win<00:04:17.870> with<00:04:18.260> all<00:04:18.380> about<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.709> hacks<00:04:18.919> but<00:04:19.160> yeah

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
win with all about the hacks but yeah

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.600 
win with all about the hacks but yeah
that<00:04:19.519> flinch<00:04:19.820> sealed<00:04:20.209> his<00:04:20.450> fate<00:04:21.669> um

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
that flinch sealed his fate um

that flinch sealed his fate um
so<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.639> just<00:04:26.060> go<00:04:26.210> with<00:04:26.360> another<00:04:26.569> dark<00:04:26.870> pulse<00:04:27.199> and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
so I just go with another dark pulse and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.589
