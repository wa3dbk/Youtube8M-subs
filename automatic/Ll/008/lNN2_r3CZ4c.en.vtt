attempt to install this 11 kilogram
spring<00:00:08.150> into<00:00:09.150> my<00:00:09.269> long<00:00:09.510> strike<00:00:09.929> now<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.250> a

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
spring into my long strike now this is a

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.600 
spring into my long strike now this is a
very<00:00:12.960> strong<00:00:13.650> spring<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.250> can't<00:00:14.490> even

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
very strong spring I can't even

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
very strong spring I can't even
completely<00:00:15.210> compress<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.230> my

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
completely compress it with just my

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.510 
completely compress it with just my
hands<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.869> I'm<00:00:18.869> gonna<00:00:19.230> install<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.400> this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
hands and I'm gonna install it in this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
hands and I'm gonna install it in this
long<00:00:20.820> strike<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.590> kind<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
long strike and see what kind of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.000 
long strike and see what kind of
performance<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> gets<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
performance it gets now right now I have

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.339 
performance it gets now right now I have
the<00:00:26.250> stage<00:00:26.550> 1<00:00:26.880> orange<00:00:27.240> mod<00:00:27.539> works<00:00:27.810> kit<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the stage 1 orange mod works kit and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
the stage 1 orange mod works kit and
salt<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.699> believe<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> spring<00:00:30.539> that's<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
salt and I believe the spring that's in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.290 
salt and I believe the spring that's in
here<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> either<00:00:32.570> 6<00:00:33.570> kilograms<00:00:34.550> maybe<00:00:35.550> 7<00:00:36.059> I'm

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
here is either 6 kilograms maybe 7 I'm

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.040 
here is either 6 kilograms maybe 7 I'm
not<00:00:36.780> sure<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.410> 6<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.690> already

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
not sure I think it's 6 and it's already

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
not sure I think it's 6 and it's already
getting<00:00:40.230> great<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.550> feet<00:00:41.910> per<00:00:42.090> second

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
getting great you know feet per second

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
getting great you know feet per second
at<00:00:43.320> close<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> 90<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.770> expect

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
at close to 90 and I really don't expect

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.819 
at close to 90 and I really don't expect
to<00:00:47.430> see<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.700> big<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.809> gain<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.320> performance

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to see that big of a gain in performance

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.670 
to see that big of a gain in performance
because<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.640> mean<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.750> plunger<00:00:52.140> tube<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.530> only

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
because I mean the plunger tube can only

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
because I mean the plunger tube can only
push<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.190> much<00:00:53.250> air<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.750> may<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:54.989> close<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
push so much air and it may be close to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
push so much air and it may be close to
max<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.750> gonna<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
max out as it is but I'm gonna put this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
max out as it is but I'm gonna put this
spring<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> either<00:00:59.699> gonna<00:01:00.350> improve

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
spring in and it's either gonna improve

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
spring in and it's either gonna improve
it<00:01:01.590> break<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> gun<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:02.940> what

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it break the gun or I don't know what

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.399 
it break the gun or I don't know what
but<00:01:04.110> uh<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.119> after<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.930> end<00:01:07.200> I'm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
but uh you know after I get this end I'm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
but uh you know after I get this end I'm
gonna<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.619> ahead<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.240> shots<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
gonna go ahead and take some shots and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.880 
gonna go ahead and take some shots and
we'll<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.430> I'm<00:01:11.430> gonna<00:01:11.520> start<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.890> stock

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
we'll see I'm gonna start off with stock

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.960 
we'll see I'm gonna start off with stock
whiteout<00:01:14.700> long<00:01:14.939> strike<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.920> use<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
whiteout long strike so we can use that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
whiteout long strike so we can use that
as<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> base<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.530> I'll<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> stage

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
as a base and then I'll go to the stage

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.719 
as a base and then I'll go to the stage
one<00:01:20.909> kit<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:22.020> I'll<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.729> hoofed

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
one kit and then I'll go to the hoofed

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
one kit and then I'll go to the hoofed
11<00:01:24.150> kilogram<00:01:24.570> spring<00:01:24.960> installed<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.159> I'm

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
11 kilogram spring installed so I'm

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
11 kilogram spring installed so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.270> ahead<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.200> spring<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
gonna go ahead and get this spring in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.800 
gonna go ahead and get this spring in
and<00:01:30.170> we'll<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.409> there

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and we'll go from there

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
and we'll go from there
alright<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> start<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.680> test<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.369> going

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
alright so to start this test I'm going

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:45.039 
alright so to start this test I'm going
to<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.479> stock<00:01:36.990> whiteout<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:38.369> straight

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:53.569

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280 

all<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.070> that's<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.550> now<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.840> reasoning

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
all right that's it now the reasoning

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.470 
all right that's it now the reasoning
for<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.650> different<00:02:14.100> range<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.210> feet<00:02:15.450> per

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
for the different range in feet per

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.250 
for the different range in feet per
second<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.460> because<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.050> how<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
second is because it's all in how the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
second is because it's all in how the
dart<00:02:19.620> fits<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> dart<00:02:22.470> fits<00:02:22.740> tighter<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:24.330> get

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
dart fits the dart fits tighter you get

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
dart fits the dart fits tighter you get
a<00:02:24.510> higher<00:02:24.750> feet<00:02:25.080> per<00:02:25.260> second<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> darts

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
a higher feet per second if the darts

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.760 
a higher feet per second if the darts
older<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> little<00:02:27.330> loose<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.440> it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
older and a little loose you know it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.570 
older and a little loose you know it's
less<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> reason<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.580> next

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
less but that's the reason for that next

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.960 
less but that's the reason for that next
I'm<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.000> use<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.980> long<00:02:35.190> strike<00:02:35.640> with

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'm going to use the long strike with

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.310 
I'm going to use the long strike with
the<00:02:36.000> orange<00:02:36.690> mad<00:02:36.900> works

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320

very<00:05:14.630> practical<00:05:15.290> at<00:05:15.560> all<00:05:16.240> I<00:05:17.320> actually<00:05:18.320> don't

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
very practical at all I actually don't

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.560 
very practical at all I actually don't
know<00:05:18.920> how<00:05:19.160> long<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.970> gun<00:05:20.180> will<00:05:20.390> withstand

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
know how long the gun will withstand

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.830 
know how long the gun will withstand
this<00:05:21.050> spring<00:05:21.440> but<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.550> guarantee<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.450> won't<00:05:23.510> be

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
this spring but I guarantee it won't be

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.690 
this spring but I guarantee it won't be
long<00:05:24.080> before<00:05:24.440> something<00:05:25.010> breaks

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
long before something breaks

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.230 
long before something breaks
because<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.120> is<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.330> very<00:05:26.600> strong<00:05:26.990> spring<00:05:27.380> and

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
because this is a very strong spring and

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.360 
because this is a very strong spring and
it<00:05:29.240> takes<00:05:29.600> two<00:05:29.930> hands<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.440> prime<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.980> gun<00:05:31.160> you

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
it takes two hands to prime the gun you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.240 
it takes two hands to prime the gun you
cannot<00:05:31.700> do<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.090> with<00:05:32.240> one<00:05:32.450> hand<00:05:32.480> at<00:05:32.930> all<00:05:33.290> so<00:05:34.070> it

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
cannot do it with one hand at all so it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.660 
cannot do it with one hand at all so it
greatly<00:05:35.240> slows<00:05:35.810> down<00:05:36.140> your<00:05:36.320> rate<00:05:36.530> of<00:05:36.560> fire<00:05:36.710> so

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
greatly slows down your rate of fire so

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.390 
greatly slows down your rate of fire so
this<00:05:38.210> spring<00:05:39.110> is<00:05:39.320> not<00:05:39.830> practical<00:05:40.520> at<00:05:41.000> all<00:05:41.330> so

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
this spring is not practical at all so

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.770 
this spring is not practical at all so
you<00:05:43.400> know<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:43.820> isn't<00:05:44.210> something<00:05:44.450> you<00:05:44.750> want

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
you know this isn't something you want

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.980 
you know this isn't something you want
in<00:05:45.290> your<00:05:46.040> long<00:05:46.220> strike<00:05:46.640> or<00:05:47.030> recon<00:05:47.510> or<00:05:47.780> Raider

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
in your long strike or recon or Raider

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.600 
in your long strike or recon or Raider
well<00:05:48.470> they<00:05:48.560> won't<00:05:48.680> even<00:05:48.950> work<00:05:49.070> in<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.280> raid<00:05:49.460> or

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
well they won't even work in a raid or

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.490 
well they won't even work in a raid or
alpha<00:05:49.940> trooper<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.420> priming<00:05:50.870> bar<00:05:51.080> would<00:05:51.290> been
