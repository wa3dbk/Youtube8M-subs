today because he has the late state of
the<00:05:04.519> art<00:05:04.699> visual<00:05:05.119> imagery<00:05:05.569> and<00:05:06.379> we<00:05:06.409> could<00:05:06.799> then

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
the art visual imagery and we could then

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.059 
the art visual imagery and we could then
determine<00:05:07.429> exactly<00:05:08.239> where<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.659> coffin<00:05:09.109> or<00:05:09.229> p3

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.609 
determine exactly where the coffin or p3
Bohm<00:05:10.309> was<00:05:10.339> in<00:05:10.939> relationship<00:05:11.749> to<00:05:11.989> the<00:05:12.379> hoof

Bohm was in relationship to the hoof

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.829 
Bohm was in relationship to the hoof
wall<00:05:12.829> and<00:05:13.279> therefore<00:05:14.119> we<00:05:14.299> could<00:05:14.479> cut<00:05:14.719> it

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:14.839 
wall and therefore we could cut it

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.809 
wall and therefore we could cut it
exactly<00:05:15.259> as<00:05:15.469> it<00:05:15.529> needed<00:05:15.799> to<00:05:15.949> be<00:05:16.069> not<00:05:16.429> have<00:05:16.609> to

as<00:05:17.809> the<00:05:17.989> old<00:05:18.169> pier<00:05:18.439> used<00:05:18.829> to<00:05:18.979> tell<00:05:19.189> me<00:05:19.339> you<00:05:19.369> cut

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
as the old pier used to tell me you cut

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.249 
as the old pier used to tell me you cut
and<00:05:19.879> cut<00:05:20.089> and<00:05:20.119> cut<00:05:20.269> until<00:05:20.629> you<00:05:20.749> see<00:05:20.959> blood<00:05:21.229> and

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
then you back up two strokes and this

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.089 
then you back up two strokes and this
way<00:05:23.809> we<00:05:24.019> can<00:05:24.199> that<00:05:24.349> we<00:05:24.379> can<00:05:24.649> do<00:05:24.739> it<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.979> right

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
way we can that we can do it the right

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
process of it indeed you don't take too

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.649 
process of it indeed you don't take too
much<00:05:39.409> and<00:05:39.649> get<00:05:39.769> down<00:05:39.949> to<00:05:39.979> cystic<00:05:40.969> tissue<00:05:41.209> and

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
much and get down to cystic tissue and

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.269 
much and get down to cystic tissue and
so<00:05:41.959> it's<00:05:42.139> it's<00:05:42.529> the<00:05:42.739> only<00:05:42.860> way<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.069> go

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
so it's it's the only way to go

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.279 
so it's it's the only way to go
especially<00:05:43.669> with<00:05:43.999> the<00:05:44.089> Taral<00:05:44.359> for<00:05:44.539> me<00:05:44.629> oh<00:05:45.019> yeah

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
especially with the Taral for me oh yeah

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.539 
especially with the Taral for me oh yeah
so<00:05:45.439> you<00:05:45.499> don't<00:05:45.559> want<00:05:45.859> to<00:05:45.949> do<00:05:46.039> this<00:05:46.189> every<00:05:46.399> day

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:46.549 
so you don't want to do this every day

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:48.459 
so you don't want to do this every day
as<00:05:46.849> you<00:05:46.909> can<00:05:47.149> see<00:05:47.329> from<00:05:47.479> how<00:05:47.659> difficult<00:05:48.139> it<00:05:48.289> was

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
as you can see from how difficult it was
