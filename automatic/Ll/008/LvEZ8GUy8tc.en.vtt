engine supply hose this is our return

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.450 
engine supply hose this is our return
line<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:33.180> put<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> return<00:00:33.960> line<00:00:34.340> into<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
line we put the return line into the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.910 
line we put the return line into the
vent<00:00:35.790> valve<00:00:37.670> from<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> original<00:00:39.590> gas<00:00:40.590> tank

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
vent valve from the original gas tank

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.130 
vent valve from the original gas tank
and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.510> vent<00:00:42.960> valve<00:00:43.309> we<00:00:44.309> modified<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
and the vent valve we modified and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.520 
and the vent valve we modified and
instead<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.899> draw<00:00:48.899> straw<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:51.530> cut

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
instead of the draw straw we use the cut

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.170 
instead of the draw straw we use the cut
a<00:00:52.559> hole<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> tank<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.000> vet<00:00:57.000> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a hole in the tank and with the vet in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.189 
a hole in the tank and with the vet in
here<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.710> more<00:01:00.199> capacity

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
here so we can get some more capacity

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
here so we can get some more capacity
out<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> tank<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.160> section<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
out of the tank because this section of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
out of the tank because this section of
the<00:01:02.699> tank<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> higher<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:05.280> supply<00:01:06.150> line<00:01:06.450> from

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the tank is higher the supply line from

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.050 
the tank is higher the supply line from
the<00:01:07.530> pump<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.760> uh<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:11.240> goes<00:01:14.060> back

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the pump is uh this one here goes back

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.890 
the pump is uh this one here goes back
here<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> drop-in<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.810> changed<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
a took this whole section out put in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
a took this whole section out put in
this<00:01:32.220> piece<00:01:32.640> removes<00:01:32.970> from<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> Jeep<00:01:33.570> Liberty

original return from your from your OEM

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.260 
original return from your from your OEM
system<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> line<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
system which is this line here so you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.830 
system which is this line here so you
plug<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.750> back<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.390> that's<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.630> much

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
plug that back in and that's pretty much

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
plug that back in and that's pretty much
it<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.640> engine<00:01:54.180> supply<00:01:54.570> line

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it so we have the engine supply line

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.560 
it so we have the engine supply line
this<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> return<00:01:56.520> line<00:01:56.549> from<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> pump

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this is the return line from the pump

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is the return line from the pump
going<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.079> back<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> tank<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.670> have
