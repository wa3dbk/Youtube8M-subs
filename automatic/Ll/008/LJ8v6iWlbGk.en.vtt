00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hey people and welcome to mikes edit 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.099
 Today it's about the subject of display magnifying glass 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.330
 and why these may well be one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.330
 can replace tripod 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.439
 that's why the name is the same 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.630
 says hatches for the display and that is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.710
 now no great art from the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.300
 derive names 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 and there are different types of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 display attract different sizes 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.179
 example and that is important if you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 Join a display team that they 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.050
 Also suitable for the display is the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 behind a camera is it if the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 display too big and the display magnifying glass too 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.950
 small, it is not so optimal 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 the other way round, it is no big no now 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 big problem but ideally fits 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 the display magnifier exactly on the display 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.739
 in the back and then there are 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 different ways how to display 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 For example, here I attached 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.260
 have the ssri here like it three 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 that is a display okotie is there 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 photo tomorrow to buy and here there is 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.320
 the possibility exists such a small one 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.840
 plate the one below a camera 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.979
 attached quite normal in the tripod gains 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 purely and then that becomes the adapter 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.100
 Just slide here 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 the whole thing pushed in firmly turned on 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.390
 the little wheel here and then stops 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 the bombproof there are also 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.259
 again the possibility of the whole per 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.790
 magnet then there is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.619
 of course the plate and not by the way 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 The plate has again 3 4 inches 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 Thread so here you can do the whole 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 again on the tripod or on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 attach a shoulder or something and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.520
 then there are as already said the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 possibility the whole by magnet too 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 then you get attached next to the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.770
 Display magnifier should be small sticker of the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.470
 is glued on around the display 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.509
 the camera and then the display magnifier 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.729
 here also a magnet and then can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.280
 to keep that simple and then 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.229
 I do not know how good it feels 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.719
 i would do that now i would be there 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.270
 not too much in hardcore use 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.460
 so surely rely on it normally 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.440
 but to watch it is enough if I now 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.220
 a lot of swivel or something or 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.690
 I have a grill where possible 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.640
 I have to be flexible 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 rather the firmer variants one 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 recommend variant of it 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 Let's get to the properties of that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.470
 a display magnifier and of course how 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.990
 the name says it is the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.040
 magnifying one of these positive 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.100
 properties 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.360
 we have a 3x magnification here 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.670
 who has filmed before and his 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
 Camera and has tried the sharpness too 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.050
 pull and judge on the display 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.480
 he knows how difficult that is 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.220
 circumstances is just in things the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.270
 it can change quite a bit 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.130
 become difficult 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 and if you have such a display luca 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.820
 and a 3x magnification of this 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.860
 image and stops here to the eye and the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.960
 directly in the eye looks like so 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.860
 viewfinder for large film cameras 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.380
 For example, it makes life easier 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.960
 a lot in any case so I'm filming 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 very much like it and it offers a lot 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.990
 many advantages 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.150
 with this 3 times magnification we 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.930
 have also the possibility one here 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.640
 adjust diopter number display 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.160
 if we need it we have it here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.950
 Possibility also front this front lens 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.830
 for example, to open or close 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.570
 for example when transporting in the camera 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.100
 backpack or something you should do that 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.810
 maybe not close with that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.570
 we somehow got damaged as well 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.220
 here is the possibility that fold up 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.250
 and the video for example, the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 advantage in the summer if you look now 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.610
 maybe want to look at the material 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.170
 still together with someone else and 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.360
 then you can for two course 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.230
 bad here in such a little hole 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.959
 look into 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.450
 you just do it all over 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.580
 no sun is shining on it 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.920
 nothing and can recognize the picture and 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.450
 then also assess directly or for 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.489
 yourself if you are not, for example 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.110
 the possibility has when filming in the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.750
 Lupe to look but a bit 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.739
 look further from above for example then 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.209
 You can do that much better too 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.250
 estimate because then nothing 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.769
 but a protection around the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.290
 Display around is another advantage 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.670
 a display magnifier offers a water 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.130
 not only that the camera a bit 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.830
 more professional she was such a 550d 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.320
 For example, the relatively small acts 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.870
 there already is a bit bigger 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.090
 a little bit bigger works for others 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.889
 a bit more professional 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.630
 always pretty cool but that's it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.490
 I would not go out but it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.169
 is about the stability 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.380
 my friends and that's the point 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.479
 where you may need a tripod 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.880
 Maybe I can only replace it 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.320
 under circumstances and possibly me too 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.180
 was recently at the night of the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.919
 jumps for example and I have the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.440
 Motorcyclists filmed them through the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.380
 Fly and have a lot with 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.580
 The tripod was made very good 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.320
 Restricted because I use the tripod 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.660
 I had to come afterwards 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.280
 but partly also the camera of the 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.280
 Tripod taken and easy to mine 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.870
 eye pressed and that is already one 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 stability point if you now the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.550
 Camera with the display magnifier stops here 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.169
 then it is much more stable than when 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.540
 you keep the camera in your hand and 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.729
 then only wobble it because so 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.710
 it does not wobble a bit you have to 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.110
 run and maybe not 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.270
 the most pleasant and but there you have to 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.400
 stop by now oliver I always schott 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.560
 so gladly say you have to go through for 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.020
 for the great shot and I am you 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.260
 synonymous take a few shots to a 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.300
 I with the display magnifier on my eye 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.729
 I did without a tripod and you will 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.440
 still not see that the recordings 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.510
 are the shaky as I have the 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.950
 Recording is not stabilized or something 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.880
 what in retrospect are but the 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.120
 really as out of camera as me the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.400
 now here a blender and that with the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.590
 with the display magnifier on my eye 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.750
 nice and good my friends the whole 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.539
 he was mainly concerned with the 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.310
 filming and there is the display magnifier 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.250
 In any case advantages but also in the 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.280
 photography has advantages with his 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.080
 display magnifier the problem is when 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.120
 we now fix the display magnifier here 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.940
 turn have then we can of course 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.400
 not through the viewfinder look around the 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.320
 shoot photo and about the lcd 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.660
 display would have done that before 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.099
 it's not exactly that 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.889
 most optimal because then the camera 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.380
 delayed triggers and to problems 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.020
 but there is the possibility here 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.490
 where you like 32 s 3 for example 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.830
 it is still such a small country and 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.570
 then you can look at the display magnifier 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.469
 Just hang a neck like that 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.240
 a photo and now i want to pack up 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.100
 the photo then sharp or ob 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.760
 everything is right and 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.910
 I keep the display just off 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.130
 are so output cool photo and so fits 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.380
 it and the lady cup too 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.910
 possibility in the photograph also stop 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.160
 to take advantage of it because 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.690
 thereby also the picture better judge 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.810
 you may not need it now 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.750
 take a laptop and test it around 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.570
 this to make the picture bigger to look at 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.480
 or extracting a zoom in the image or so 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.250
 you can do it with the display magnifier 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.950
 excellent already proven and direct 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.470
 Check if it's hot or not 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.730
 this job would interest me 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.470
 you use that lost you have 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.310
 maybe my display magnifier if so 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.650
 Which 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.900
 and what do you think of display luton 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.190
 Generally, the whole post like to post 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.810
 in the comments when you sign up for 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.120
 I am interested in this display magnifier 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.010
 very much used the sims 3 looks 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.240
 at foto tomorrow by left link to pack 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.960
 I also send you down to the bio 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.820
 description 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.770
 otherwise I hope you have the video 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.360
 fallen and also helped if so 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.250
 is the thumb upwards 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.780
 do not forget to subscribe for free 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.400
 then you will not miss any of these videos 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.230
 more and share the video also like 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.120
 care friend so even more people 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.100
 hardly enjoy this grandiose in the enjoyment
