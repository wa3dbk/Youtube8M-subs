just<00:04:47.389> not<00:04:48.389> fun<00:04:48.720> frankly

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
just not fun frankly

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.979 
just not fun frankly
and<00:04:50.559> it's<00:04:51.159> not<00:04:51.339> even<00:04:51.399> slow<00:04:52.029> in<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.419> shin

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:52.989 
and it's not even slow in the shin

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:56.040 
and it's not even slow in the shin
megami<00:04:53.169> tensei<00:04:53.889> kind<00:04:54.189> of<00:04:54.309> slow<00:04:54.550> where<00:04:55.149> it's

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
megami tensei kind of slow where it's

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.259 
megami tensei kind of slow where it's
just<00:04:56.379> slow<00:04:56.619> because<00:04:56.949> normal<00:04:57.729> battles<00:04:58.029> take

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:58.269 
just slow because normal battles take

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:59.999 
just slow because normal battles take
forever<00:04:58.629> because<00:04:59.050> they're<00:04:59.199> so<00:04:59.349> fucking<00:04:59.739> hard

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
forever because they're so fucking hard

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.079 
forever because they're so fucking hard
no<00:05:00.729> no<00:05:01.059> it's<00:05:01.239> not<00:05:01.360> like<00:05:01.569> that<00:05:02.429> this<00:05:03.429> game<00:05:03.759> is

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:04.089 
no no it's not like that this game is

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.529 
no no it's not like that this game is
slow<00:05:04.509> because<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.739> animations<00:05:06.669> are<00:05:06.969> so

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
slow because the animations are so

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.369 
slow because the animations are so
goddamn<00:05:08.259> long<00:05:09.149> that<00:05:10.149> it<00:05:10.300> takes<00:05:10.569> for<00:05:10.959> fucking

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
goddamn long that it takes for fucking

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.839 
goddamn long that it takes for fucking
ever<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.429> do<00:05:12.639> regular<00:05:13.509> fucking<00:05:13.929> attacks<00:05:14.849> just

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
ever to do regular fucking attacks just

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.729 
ever to do regular fucking attacks just
think<00:05:16.089> for<00:05:16.149> a<00:05:16.300> second<00:05:16.629> think<00:05:16.839> if<00:05:17.139> in<00:05:17.349> Final

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:17.739 
think for a second think if in Final

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:22.679 
think for a second think if in Final
Fantasy<00:05:17.889> 7<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:19.080> normal<00:05:20.080> attack<00:05:20.999> took<00:05:21.999> no<00:05:22.419> no

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:22.689 
Fantasy 7 a normal attack took no no

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.779 
Fantasy 7 a normal attack took no no
strike<00:05:23.589> that<00:05:23.969> think<00:05:24.969> if<00:05:25.179> every<00:05:25.809> attack<00:05:26.789> every

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
strike that think if every attack every

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.109 
strike that think if every attack every
special<00:05:28.419> move<00:05:28.659> everything<00:05:29.429> took<00:05:30.429> as<00:05:30.610> long<00:05:30.639> as

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:31.119 
special move everything took as long as

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.790 
special move everything took as long as
Knights<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.689> rim<00:05:31.869> just<00:05:32.319> think<00:05:32.559> about<00:05:32.679> that

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
Knights the rim just think about that

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.089 
Knights the rim just think about that
for<00:05:33.189> a<00:05:33.249> second<00:05:33.669> let<00:05:33.849> that<00:05:33.879> sink<00:05:34.300> in<00:05:34.479> it<00:05:35.099> would

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
for a second let that sink in it would

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.949 
for a second let that sink in it would
be<00:05:36.249> terrible<00:05:36.789> you'd<00:05:36.969> want<00:05:37.179> to<00:05:37.269> shoot<00:05:37.509> yourself

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:37.959

over you do understand that in a game

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.869 
over you do understand that in a game
like<00:06:07.509> this<00:06:08.189> people<00:06:09.189> are<00:06:09.249> going<00:06:09.339> to<00:06:09.429> be<00:06:09.519> finding

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
like this people are going to be finding

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.489 
like this people are going to be finding
a<00:06:09.909> lot<00:06:10.029> of<00:06:10.149> enemies<00:06:10.569> and<00:06:10.839> therefore<00:06:11.409> we're

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
a lot of enemies and therefore we're

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.139 
a lot of enemies and therefore we're
going<00:06:11.529> to<00:06:11.709> be<00:06:11.800> seen<00:06:12.039> seeing<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.639> same<00:06:12.819> things

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:13.149 
going to be seen seeing the same things

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:16.529 
going to be seen seeing the same things
over<00:06:13.329> and<00:06:13.599> over<00:06:14.399> so<00:06:15.399> you<00:06:15.490> might<00:06:16.029> want<00:06:16.389> to<00:06:16.509> cut

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
over and over so you might want to cut

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.339 
over and over so you might want to cut
that<00:06:16.959> animation<00:06:17.379> time<00:06:17.679> down<00:06:17.999> just<00:06:18.999> a<00:06:19.269> smidge

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
that animation time down just a smidge

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.389 
that animation time down just a smidge
just<00:06:20.349> a<00:06:20.469> thought<00:06:20.499> just<00:06:20.949> throwing<00:06:21.129> it<00:06:21.279> out

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:21.399 
just a thought just throwing it out

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:24.569 
just a thought just throwing it out
there<00:06:22.259> although<00:06:23.259> now<00:06:23.679> that<00:06:23.709> I<00:06:23.919> think<00:06:24.039> about<00:06:24.369> it

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:24.579 
there although now that I think about it

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.579 
there although now that I think about it
I<00:06:24.939> guess<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.509> could<00:06:25.659> understand<00:06:26.139> why<00:06:26.349> they

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:26.589 
I guess I could understand why they

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:28.499 
I guess I could understand why they
might<00:06:26.829> not<00:06:27.009> think<00:06:27.069> it<00:06:27.369> was<00:06:27.459> a<00:06:27.489> huge<00:06:27.759> deal<00:06:27.819> they

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
might not think it was a huge deal they

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.449 
might not think it was a huge deal they
probably<00:06:28.749> just<00:06:28.899> realized<00:06:29.649> that<00:06:29.919> hey<00:06:30.189> it's

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:30.459 
probably just realized that hey it's

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.729 
probably just realized that hey it's
okay<00:06:30.819> because<00:06:31.329> fifty<00:06:31.929> percent<00:06:32.229> of<00:06:32.349> this<00:06:32.469> game

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:32.739 
okay because fifty percent of this game

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:55.189 
okay because fifty percent of this game
is<00:06:32.979> just<00:06:33.279> fucking<00:06:34.239> got<00:06:34.599> sad

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:04.110 

huh<00:06:56.199> huh<00:06:57.100> huh<00:07:00.990> sorry<00:07:01.990> about<00:07:02.139> that<00:07:02.970> moving<00:07:03.970> on

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
huh huh huh sorry about that moving on

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.980 
huh huh huh sorry about that moving on
ah<00:07:05.550> I<00:07:06.550> guess<00:07:06.940> I<00:07:07.060> could<00:07:07.180> talk<00:07:07.360> about<00:07:07.510> the<00:07:07.720> fact

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
ah I guess I could talk about the fact

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.600 
ah I guess I could talk about the fact
that<00:07:09.180> most<00:07:10.180> of<00:07:10.360> the<00:07:10.479> game<00:07:10.690> has<00:07:11.310> basically<00:07:12.310> no

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
that most of the game has basically no

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.030 
that most of the game has basically no
music<00:07:13.120> I<00:07:13.330> guess<00:07:14.320> they<00:07:14.680> were<00:07:14.740> under<00:07:15.010> the

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
music I guess they were under the

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.950 
music I guess they were under the
impression<00:07:15.130> that<00:07:15.639> people<00:07:15.850> really<00:07:16.419> dig

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
impression that people really dig

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.560 
impression that people really dig
ambient<00:07:17.680> space<00:07:17.860> noises<00:07:18.610> I<00:07:18.820> mean<00:07:19.479> that's

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570 
ambient space noises I mean that's
