00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in reinventing what that can be in the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
in reinventing what that can be in the
case<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.270> Maleficent<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> her

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
case of Maleficent we don't think of her

as<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.399> parade<00:00:35.790> float<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> her<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
as a parade float we think of her as a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 
as a parade float we think of her as a
creature<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.340> wanted<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
creature we really wanted to be a

fire-breathing dragon

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
fire-breathing dragon
but<00:00:40.410> how<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.940> interpret<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> tells

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
but how do we interpret it so it tells

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.150 
but how do we interpret it so it tells
part<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> film

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
part of the film

the spinning wheel to me is always like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.880 
the spinning wheel to me is always like
sort<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.739> major<00:00:47.899> piece<00:00:48.899> between<00:00:49.320> Sleeping

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

Beauty and Maleficent part of the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
Beauty and Maleficent part of the
relationship<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> did<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> left<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
relationship so what I did is I left the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.080 
relationship so what I did is I left the
center<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> body<00:00:54.420> open<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.969> put<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
center of the body open and put the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
center of the body open and put the
spinning<00:00:57.449> wheel<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.710> spinning

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
spinning wheel on that and the spinning

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
spinning wheel on that and the spinning
wheel<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> heart<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> dragon<00:01:00.270> because

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
wheel is the heart of the dragon because

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.779 
wheel is the heart of the dragon because
we<00:01:01.440> had<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> spinning<00:01:02.129> wheel<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> thought

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
we had the spinning wheel and I thought

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.990 
we had the spinning wheel and I thought
years<00:01:03.719> movement<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> did<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> as

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
years movement what if we did it as

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.690 
years movement what if we did it as
steampunk<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> steampunk

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
the greatest joy is the end result where

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.850 
the greatest joy is the end result where
I<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.049> see<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.380> front<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.710> public
