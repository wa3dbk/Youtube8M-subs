00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.600
 of the students' company in class today we are going 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.060
 to experience 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.410
 the plant 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.679
 situation 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.819
 the situation plan 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.019
 is the representation of the street in relation to the limits 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.560
 and confronting 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.169
 debut lautsi block and streets where it is located 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.499
 the building 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:24.569
 So 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.569
 I noticed in the drawing 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.259
 that we have 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.710
 for example him 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 plant situation 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.590
 paulo we observe 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.820
 the court 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.570
 the lots 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 the street called projected street 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.990
 or even in question the one we are working on 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.180
 it should always appear 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.710
 with line 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 to drop we had a thicker line 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.179
 this situation plan 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.030
 is precisely the plant where the lots 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.390
 They are 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.159
 identified 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.230
 in longer relation for example 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.240
 How do you live? 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.660
 the street where you live exists 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 couples adjoining 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 couples 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 'on the edge' facing front side 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 rl posterior 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.030
 the representation of each lot of your neighbor on the left side of your neighbor 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.240
 on the right side of your neighbor on the back 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.400
 when we represent 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 this street 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.710
 the street 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.760
 posterior 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.640
 to the left forming a set of blocks 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.329
 constituting later in a forest and region that would be its neighborhood 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.080
 so we have a situation plan there, but we make a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.720
 clipping 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 of the toll we are 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.080
 studying 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.530
 the representation 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.379
 this cut 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.629
 we will always do with 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.829
 lina d was south 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.809
 Score 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.289
 let's see here 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.289
 in them what I wanted to represent 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.299
 another street 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.129
 who would it be 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.129
 thorn 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 so let's say this street here designed 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.199
 another name 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.289
 of existence 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 here we will pass 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.699
 rupture means finding a better container 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.929
 Park and 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.559
 to be continued 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.779
 on here 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.849
 to be continued 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.099
 Park and 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.129
 to be continued 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 this street is the call and mouha 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.579
 street belÃ©m 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.579
 she who are jewels 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.239
 set d 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.239
 or lopes 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.019
 another set of lots 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.929
 To the house we have on that side too. 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.929
 but a set of lots 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.919
 the script you are 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.599
 what are we going to treat let's say this is here 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.819
 so they have here 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 style of us will make 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 I want the line to appear 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.220
 fuller then I encourage that we are treating 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.689
 on the designed street 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.639
 on the court 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.259
 for example 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.939
 then it would be the third batch 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.270
 Sometimes we might as well say 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.569
 to emphasize 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.460
 the lupi figure 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.599
 and with the respective today 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:39.689
 girls 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.699
 a terrain 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.699
 Let's try 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.449
 12 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.569
 12 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.289
 for having fought on the designed street 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.050
 confronting the street 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.050
 of a particular neighborhood 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 parker appears guidance 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.259
 indicating 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.270
 one of the cardinal points 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.020
 the magnetic north 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.400
 then it means 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.699
 the north being in that direction 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:23.719
 That 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.570
 pin style residence 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.729
 be 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.889
 placed on 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.050
 with the front to the goal grandchild then it will be with blessed makes such guidance 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.699
 ahead of rest of the land 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:40.909
 is being 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.069
 situated to the north 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.110
 consequently 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.840
 the north right is the Levski that area vegetarian toboggan that will 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.450
 be 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.830
 the rising sun 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.860
 consequently here we have or 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.559
 poletto 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.150
 then stop 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.589
 design and development you will 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.199
 these observations 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.949
 and there, always observing 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.919
 the best situation d show 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.119
 northeast 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:21.229
 just the web alias northeast winds this good network ventilation 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.419
 for the development of projects 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.490
 in the case of the occupational safety technician 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.520
 only this information 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.289
 for what 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.440
 that he has 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.110
 until ct are 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.919
 the eyes 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.219
 and from there 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.229
 ventilation in the case of the stairway building where they go, we will not have the area 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.800
 of residence in the northeast 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.860
 southeast event then the situation palette is nothing less than the 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.399
 whereas this representation 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.509
 today 3 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.749
 in relation to the set issued and 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.220
 and has relation 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.409
 to trainings 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:01.979
 realize we have a block 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.559
 vests 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.430
 with them 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.680
 the limitations through leopoldo then we have that we will have a 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.840
 position 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.690
 a fraction of the brand in the region to show that it can be owned 

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:21.699
 the building that we are 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.589
 so I hope you 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.379
 do an exercise 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.969
 that doubts are healed 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:30.209
 with that until the next meeting
