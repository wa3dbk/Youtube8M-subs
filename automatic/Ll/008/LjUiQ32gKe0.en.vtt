put in a notch filter at 160 I wanted
you<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> before<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.200> hear<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you to know this before you hear the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.820 
you to know this before you hear the
sound<00:02:04.710> clips

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.710 

here's<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> picture<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.850> each<00:02:10.240> one<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.630> the

here's a picture of each one of the
frequency<00:02:11.170> response<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.920> there's<00:02:12.220> no<00:02:12.460> EQ

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
frequency response is there's no EQ

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 
frequency response is there's no EQ
other<00:02:13.210> than<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.600> told<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.990> about<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.830> can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
other than what I told you about you can

other than what I told you about you can
see<00:02:15.160> both<00:02:15.370> ribbons<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.970> course<00:02:16.210> are<00:02:16.450> rolling

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
see both ribbons of course are rolling

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.440

are coming in but first here's a few
thoughts<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:45.190> about<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
thoughts just think about the kind of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
thoughts just think about the kind of
sound<00:02:46.300> you're<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.720> hear<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.050> few

sounds<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.210> little<00:02:49.330> bit<00:02:49.480> different<00:02:49.540> here's<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
sounds a little bit different here's a

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.890 

ribbons<00:06:03.580> are<00:06:03.759> all<00:06:03.879> about<00:06:04.090> this<00:06:04.360> vintage

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
ribbons are all about this vintage

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.809 
ribbons are all about this vintage
classic<00:06:05.500> sound<00:06:05.770> with<00:06:06.069> that<00:06:06.280> rolled<00:06:06.669> off

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
classic sound with that rolled off

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.330 
classic sound with that rolled off
high-end<00:06:07.449> and<00:06:07.870> velvety<00:06:08.289> smoothness<00:06:08.889> and<00:06:09.280> the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
high-end and velvety smoothness and the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.670 
high-end and velvety smoothness and the
blooming<00:06:09.969> technique<00:06:10.629> is<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.050> way<00:06:11.169> to<00:06:11.229> pick<00:06:11.500> up

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
blooming technique is the way to pick up

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.360 
blooming technique is the way to pick up
the<00:06:11.949> 360<00:06:12.819> degrees<00:06:13.090> in<00:06:13.419> your<00:06:13.599> recording<00:06:14.370> area

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
the 360 degrees in your recording area

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.520 
the 360 degrees in your recording area
and<00:06:15.939> so<00:06:16.419> I<00:06:16.479> wanted<00:06:16.719> you<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:16.930> have<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.110> sense<00:06:17.349> of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
and so I wanted you to have a sense of

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.659 
and so I wanted you to have a sense of
what<00:06:17.650> this<00:06:17.740> would<00:06:17.919> sound<00:06:18.129> like<00:06:18.250> I'm<00:06:18.520> just

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
what this would sound like I'm just

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.309 
what this would sound like I'm just
moving<00:06:19.030> around<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.389> mic<00:06:19.539> you<00:06:19.840> could<00:06:20.020> hear<00:06:20.199> my

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
moving around the mic you could hear my

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.149 
moving around the mic you could hear my
voice<00:06:20.349> moving

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
voice moving

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.650 
voice moving
that's<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:21.939> 360<00:06:22.509> pickup<00:06:22.810> which<00:06:22.990> is<00:06:23.139> fun

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.720 

so<00:06:27.660> a<00:06:27.690> couple<00:06:27.990> of<00:06:28.110> last<00:06:28.320> thoughts<00:06:28.680> here<00:06:29.070> as<00:06:29.520> you

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
so a couple of last thoughts here as you

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.400 
so a couple of last thoughts here as you
most<00:06:29.880> likely<00:06:30.090> know<00:06:30.240> I<00:06:30.390> haven't<00:06:30.780> really<00:06:30.990> acute

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
most likely know I haven't really acute

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.290 
most likely know I haven't really acute
anything<00:06:32.040> I<00:06:32.310> want<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.670> to<00:06:32.760> be<00:06:32.880> able<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.090> hear

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
anything I want you to be able to hear

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.930 
anything I want you to be able to hear
how<00:06:33.450> the<00:06:33.510> mics<00:06:33.750> sound<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:35.310> vignette<00:06:35.700> does

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
how the mics sound the vignette does

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.930 
how the mics sound the vignette does
have<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.450> transformer<00:06:37.350> upgrade<00:06:37.980> so<00:06:38.430> that's

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
have the transformer upgrade so that's

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.580 
have the transformer upgrade so that's
somewhat<00:06:39.360> more<00:06:39.540> availability<00:06:39.840> quality<00:06:40.470> as

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
somewhat more availability quality as

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.470 
somewhat more availability quality as
may<00:06:40.740> be<00:06:40.800> explained<00:06:41.310> by<00:06:41.490> that<00:06:41.670> but<00:06:42.450> I

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
may be explained by that but I

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.270 
may be explained by that but I
understand<00:06:42.960> the<00:06:43.080> Panthers<00:06:43.530> can<00:06:43.950> get

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
understand the Panthers can get

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.370 
understand the Panthers can get
transformer<00:06:45.270> upgrade<00:06:45.630> to<00:06:45.870> or<00:06:46.200> that's

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
transformer upgrade to or that's

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.710 
transformer upgrade to or that's
