00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.370 
in his team can actually take the pick
up<00:06:04.940> because<00:06:05.390> he<00:06:05.450> doesn't<00:06:05.600> have<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.810> gang<00:06:05.990> go<00:06:06.110> and

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
up because he doesn't have a gang go and

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.870 
up because he doesn't have a gang go and
he<00:06:06.440> goes<00:06:06.770> step<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:07.160> that's<00:06:07.340> pretty<00:06:07.520> nice<00:06:07.730> so

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
he goes step so that's pretty nice so

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.250 
he goes step so that's pretty nice so
yeah<00:06:08.030> now<00:06:08.420> I'm<00:06:08.480> gonna<00:06:08.570> decide<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:08.960> go<00:06:09.050> for<00:06:09.080> a

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
yeah now I'm gonna decide to go for a

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.500 
yeah now I'm gonna decide to go for a
fake<00:06:09.440> out<00:06:09.560> at<00:06:09.710> that<00:06:10.040> desk<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.610> lot<00:06:11.000> it<00:06:11.240> actually

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
fake out at that desk a lot it actually

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.270 
fake out at that desk a lot it actually
kills<00:06:11.660> it<00:06:11.900> with<00:06:12.050> a<00:06:12.260> crit<00:06:12.590> but<00:06:12.800> critically

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
kills it with a crit but critically

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.650 
kills it with a crit but critically
doesn't<00:06:13.520> matter<00:06:13.640> because<00:06:13.850> Pratt<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.480> bond

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
doesn't matter because Pratt the bond

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.940 
doesn't matter because Pratt the bond
would<00:06:14.840> have<00:06:14.990> taken<00:06:15.170> the<00:06:15.350> car<00:06:15.500> let's<00:06:15.650> count<00:06:15.830> our

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
would have taken the car let's count our

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.140 
would have taken the car let's count our
child<00:06:16.190> so<00:06:16.370> now<00:06:16.490> it's<00:06:16.610> gonna<00:06:16.700> decide<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.030> go

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
child so now it's gonna decide to go

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.080 
child so now it's gonna decide to go
into<00:06:17.180> boredom<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.080> I'm<00:06:18.530> go<00:06:18.770> to<00:06:18.970> think<00:06:19.970> he's

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
into boredom and I'm go to think he's

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.340 
into boredom and I'm go to think he's
gonna<00:06:20.210> go<00:06:20.330> for<00:06:20.360> hydro<00:06:20.720> pump<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.050> I'm<00:06:21.110> gonna<00:06:21.230> go

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
gonna go for hydro pump and I'm gonna go

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.680 
gonna go for hydro pump and I'm gonna go
for<00:06:21.500> sucker<00:06:21.680> punch<00:06:21.920> but<00:06:22.160> it<00:06:22.250> in<00:06:22.430> fact<00:06:22.490> feels<00:06:23.210> so

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
for sucker punch but it in fact feels so

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.330 
for sucker punch but it in fact feels so
I<00:06:23.930> thought<00:06:24.290> maybe<00:06:24.350> addressed<00:06:24.920> but<00:06:25.100> he's<00:06:25.250> gonna

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
I thought maybe addressed but he's gonna

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.770 
I thought maybe addressed but he's gonna
go<00:06:25.520> for<00:06:25.550> trick<00:06:25.850> so<00:06:25.970> maybe<00:06:26.180> he<00:06:26.330> predicted<00:06:26.720> that

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
go for trick so maybe he predicted that

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.570 
go for trick so maybe he predicted that
with<00:06:27.050> DVDs<00:06:27.500> that<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.830> really<00:06:28.070> good<00:06:28.190> prediction

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
with DVDs that is really good prediction

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.220 
with DVDs that is really good prediction
but<00:06:28.730> yeah<00:06:28.940> he's<00:06:29.390> gonna<00:06:29.540> tell<00:06:29.840> you<00:06:29.900> switch<00:06:30.080> out

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
but yeah he's gonna tell you switch out

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.990 
but yeah he's gonna tell you switch out
of<00:06:30.410> there<00:06:30.530> and<00:06:30.710> go<00:06:30.890> into<00:06:31.130> Garchomp<00:06:31.640> while<00:06:31.790> I<00:06:31.820> go

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
of there and go into Garchomp while I go

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.150 
of there and go into Garchomp while I go
for<00:06:32.180> sucker<00:06:32.360> punch<00:06:32.630> once<00:06:33.080> again

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
for sucker punch once again

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.710 
for sucker punch once again
I<00:06:34.430> thought<00:06:34.760> maybe<00:06:34.940> he's<00:06:35.120> not<00:06:35.240> scarred<00:06:35.480> with

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
I thought maybe he's not scarred with

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.330 
I thought maybe he's not scarred with
that<00:06:35.870> because<00:06:36.020> he<00:06:36.320> didn't<00:06:36.590> go<00:06:36.740> for<00:06:36.950> trick<00:06:37.160> so

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
that because he didn't go for trick so

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.060 
that because he didn't go for trick so
maybe<00:06:37.610> he<00:06:37.820> thought<00:06:38.000> cough<00:06:38.450> because<00:06:39.050> why<00:06:39.890> would

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
maybe he thought cough because why would

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.650 
maybe he thought cough because why would
you<00:06:40.100> do<00:06:40.250> that<00:06:40.310> but<00:06:40.550> okay<00:06:40.790> that's<00:06:41.150> stupid<00:06:41.510> but

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
you do that but okay that's stupid but

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.570 
you do that but okay that's stupid but
whatever<00:06:41.780> see<00:06:42.350> now<00:06:42.470> he's<00:06:42.590> gonna<00:06:42.710> go<00:06:42.890> into<00:06:43.370> his

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
whatever see now he's gonna go into his

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.850 
whatever see now he's gonna go into his
God<00:06:43.790> drop<00:06:44.030> go<00:06:44.270> for<00:06:44.450> an<00:06:44.510> EQ<00:06:44.840> and<00:06:45.020> though<00:06:45.380> there's
