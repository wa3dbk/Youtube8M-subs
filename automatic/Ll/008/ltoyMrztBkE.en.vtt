certified drivers not everybody has this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280 
certified drivers not everybody has this
problem<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.170> a

problem about I want to show you a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
problem about I want to show you a
little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:41.100> later<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> video<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.510> can

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
little bit later in this video what can

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
little bit later in this video what can
happen<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> phenomenon<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.910> will<00:00:45.030> see

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
happen and the phenomenon you will see

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
happen and the phenomenon you will see
is<00:00:45.480> called<00:00:45.620> artifacts<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.070> entirely

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is called artifacts I'm not entirely

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
is called artifacts I'm not entirely
sure<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.719> technical<00:00:49.230> reasons<00:00:49.860> behind

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sure of the technical reasons behind

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.450 
sure of the technical reasons behind
this<00:00:51.500> yeah<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> things<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> did

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this yeah one of the things that I did

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
this yeah one of the things that I did
to<00:00:53.579> focus<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.000> mostly<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.750> playing

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to focus on mostly when I was playing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.209 
to focus on mostly when I was playing
this<00:00:55.199> game<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:56.309> flying<00:00:56.879> jets<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:58.160> since<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this game was flying jets and since I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
this game was flying jets and since I
haven't<00:00:59.460> done<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> year<00:01:01.559> or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
haven't done this in about a year or

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
haven't done this in about a year or
even<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.340> than<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:04.229> does<00:01:04.409> take

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
even more than that it really does take

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
even more than that it really does take
some<00:01:05.369> getting<00:01:05.430> used<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.939> again<00:01:06.119> flying

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
some getting used to again flying

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
some getting used to again flying
implants<00:01:07.530> r2<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.420> now

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
implants r2 is very very different now

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
implants r2 is very very different now
if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.610> flying<00:01:11.939> jets<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
if you want to get into flying jets in

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.679 
if you want to get into flying jets in
battle<00:01:12.900> 3<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.979> first<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> most

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
battle 3 the first and the most

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
battle 3 the first and the most
important<00:01:16.140> things<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> learn<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> handle

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
important things to learn how to handle

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.990 
important things to learn how to handle
is<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.520> able<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> stay<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.780> 350<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.000> I'm

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
is to be able to stay at the 350 and I'm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
is to be able to stay at the 350 and I'm
talking<00:01:21.270> about<00:01:21.330> speed<00:01:22.340> because<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.640> allows

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
talking about speed because that allows

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.990 
talking about speed because that allows
you<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> quickest<00:01:24.990> turns<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:26.369> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you to make the quickest turns but this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
you to make the quickest turns but this
video<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.049> any<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
video is not gonna be any kind of a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
video is not gonna be any kind of a
flying<00:01:29.070> tutorial<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.880> upload<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.299> video<00:01:30.479> just

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
flying tutorial I upload this video just

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
flying tutorial I upload this video just
to<00:01:30.930> show<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.310> happen<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.970> have

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to show you what can happen if you have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
to show you what can happen if you have
the<00:01:33.420> latest<00:01:33.780> Nvidia<00:01:34.680> drivers<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:37.079> starts

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the latest Nvidia drivers so it starts

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.109 
the latest Nvidia drivers so it starts
off<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> lags<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.579> makes<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
off with a lot of lags it makes it of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.450 
off with a lot of lags it makes it of
course<00:01:39.299> impossible<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> aim<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> control

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
course impossible to aim and control

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609 
course impossible to aim and control
your<00:01:41.640> aircraft<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> lag

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
your aircraft and the same kind of lag

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.590 
your aircraft and the same kind of lag
set<00:01:43.979> transfers<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.180> you're<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
set transfers over to if you're on the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.730 
set transfers over to if you're on the
ground<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.079> whatever<00:01:46.310> but<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.909> visible

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
ground or whatever but the visible

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
ground or whatever but the visible
phenomenon<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
phenomenon is what you can see here it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.030 
phenomenon is what you can see here it
looks<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:52.020> different<00:01:52.259> from<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.860> situation

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
looks very different from the situation

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
looks very different from the situation
in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> situation<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.689> let<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in the situation but I'm gonna let this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.039 
in the situation but I'm gonna let this
video<00:01:55.320> rules<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
video rules so that you can see what it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.800 
video rules so that you can see what it
