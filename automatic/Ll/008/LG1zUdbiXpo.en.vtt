let<00:04:06.459> me<00:04:06.549> see<00:04:06.670> for<00:04:06.880> how<00:04:07.060> one<00:04:07.269> yeah<00:04:08.040> these<00:04:09.040> little

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
let me see for how one yeah these little

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.870 
let me see for how one yeah these little
things<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.880> NFC<00:04:10.239> tags<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.860> two<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.459> these<00:04:12.610> are

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
things the NFC tags the two of these are

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120 
things the NFC tags the two of these are
given<00:04:13.239> with<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.450> phones<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:14.530> these<00:04:14.980> are

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
given with the phones you these are

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.250 
given with the phones you these are
rewritable<00:04:15.760> NFC<00:04:16.239> tags<00:04:16.450> basically<00:04:17.109> how<00:04:17.229> it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
rewritable NFC tags basically how it

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.349 
rewritable NFC tags basically how it
works<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.760> push<00:04:19.000> your<00:04:19.150> phone<00:04:19.329> on

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
works is that you you push your phone on

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.150 
works is that you you push your phone on
to<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.750> NFC<00:04:20.049> tag<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.709> changes<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
to the NFC tag and it changes the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.219 
to the NFC tag and it changes the
profile<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.820> have<00:04:22.539> selected<00:04:22.660> for<00:04:23.110> your
