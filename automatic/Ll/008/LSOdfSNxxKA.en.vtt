from<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> bottom<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:08.860> I've<00:01:08.950> drilled<00:01:09.220> holes

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
from the bottom and I've drilled holes

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.910 
from the bottom and I've drilled holes
all<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.910> way<00:01:10.030> around<00:01:10.350> life<00:01:11.350> cycle<00:01:11.800> what<00:01:11.890> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
all the way around life cycle what a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.590 
all the way around life cycle what a
maggot<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.640> flies<00:01:12.940> don't<00:01:13.270> get<00:01:13.390> in<00:01:13.510> that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
maggot is that flies don't get in that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.350 
maggot is that flies don't get in that
bucket<00:01:13.890> he's<00:01:14.890> gonna<00:01:15.070> lay<00:01:15.190> eggs<00:01:15.850> for<00:01:16.300> the

to hatch and for about three days

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.080 
to hatch and for about three days
they're<00:01:20.770> going<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:20.950> consume<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.460> meat<00:01:21.730> soon

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090

any time at all you know we're bug on

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.190 
any time at all you know we're bug on
the<00:01:37.750> ground<00:01:38.080> he's<00:01:38.800> not<00:01:38.980> going<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.160> last<00:01:39.310> long

the ground he's not going to last long
alright<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.310> reason<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.510> have<00:01:43.690> these<00:01:43.900> so<00:01:44.170> high

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
alright the reason we have these so high

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.400 
alright the reason we have these so high
is<00:01:45.580> because<00:01:45.640> believe<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.420> or<00:01:46.480> not<00:01:46.600> maggot

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
is because believe it or not maggot

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.610 
is because believe it or not maggot
farming<00:01:47.860> have<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.160> smell<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.960> sure<00:01:50.170> does<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:52.620> we

sheet metal when that maggot hits the
ground<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.510> mean<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:28.260> say<00:04:28.590> our<00:04:28.710> chickens<00:04:29.130> do

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
ground I mean you say our chickens do

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.540 
ground I mean you say our chickens do
get<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.380> some<00:04:31.380> hits<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.680> ground<00:04:31.860> they<00:04:32.280> go<00:04:32.430> over

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
get on some hits the ground they go over

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.980 
get on some hits the ground they go over
there<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.820> find<00:04:32.970> out<00:04:33.090> why<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.450> moving<00:04:33.840> what

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
there and find out why it's moving what

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.690 
there and find out why it's moving what
it<00:04:34.080> tastes<00:04:34.260> like<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.400> get<00:04:35.580> that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
it tastes like and so you get that

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.640 
it tastes like and so you get that
