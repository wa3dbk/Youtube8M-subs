00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.100
 decomposed into a local bed when 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 spreading the truth she takes half the room 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 but then it is comfortable then bedside 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.370

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.610
 besides this chair and this chair 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.360
 language and but the picture itself is also language 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 mena is also very, very much so then 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 there are two bags with which I most often 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 I go 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.200
 this is michael kors and type silin here is a dream 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.750
 Yesterday I went to my table 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 very cool long is almost two 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.320
 m no 2-meter is why it is very 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.020
 long but he is only 40 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.020
 what centimeters how wide she 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 very bright light rarely turn on the view 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.020
 from my window such here yes I raised 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.679
 curtains so you have good lighting 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.120
 a computer like orchids 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.400
 artificial heavy 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.040
 because she is the real packing here in 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.700
 my speakers there are all sorts of different boxes 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.420
 also, in general, nothing interesting my my 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.110
 plants 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 I forgot the item sore banks were where 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.569
 but in general there are many who die like that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 does not die 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:38.150
 Vova wrote my mom to me he too 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:41.360
 very much so here's probably 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.720
 my most favorite part of my room is 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.660
 dressing table 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.180
 because I spend a lot of time here 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.569
 In general, here I need a body lotion 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.959
 so here and then two boxes of pandora 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:02.299
