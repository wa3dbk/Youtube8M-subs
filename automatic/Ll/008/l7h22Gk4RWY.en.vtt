00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
reason I did this once on this computer

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
reason I did this once on this computer
not<00:00:33.270> an<00:00:33.450> office<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> kawai<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> computer

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
not an office to kawai the computer

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
not an office to kawai the computer
setup<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.980> did<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.340> once<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> computer

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
setup I did that once on the computer

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.130 
setup I did that once on the computer
when<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:38.210> second<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.420> wipe<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.809> said<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
when a second time I wipe that I said it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
when a second time I wipe that I said it
so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.190> some<00:00:41.370> reason<00:00:41.399> every

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so I can do that for some reason every

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
so I can do that for some reason every
time<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.420> wipe<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> computer<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.559> always

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
time I wipe the computer it always

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
time I wipe the computer it always
automatically<00:00:44.820> sets<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.239> profile<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> share

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050
