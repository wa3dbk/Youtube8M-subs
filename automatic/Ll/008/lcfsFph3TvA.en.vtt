00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.460 
of honor and I called Lydia stuff they
all<00:00:30.390> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> feel<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> same<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> only

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
all kind of feel the same and the only

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
all kind of feel the same and the only
two<00:00:31.679> games<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.070> feel<00:00:32.279> feel<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.730> bit

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
two games I feel feel a little bit

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.959 
two games I feel feel a little bit
different<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.770> Crysis<00:00:34.770> 2<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.309> break

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
different or like Crysis 2 and break

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.030 
different or like Crysis 2 and break
just<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.450> they're<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.840> different<00:00:37.710> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
just because they're so different in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
just because they're so different in
Crysis<00:00:38.370> 2<00:00:38.399> isn't<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.329> huge<00:00:40.290> difference

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
Crysis 2 isn't really a huge difference

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040 
Crysis 2 isn't really a huge difference
but<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.640> definitely<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.480> makes<00:00:42.809> everything

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
but it definitely just makes everything

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
but it definitely just makes everything
in<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.160> loop<00:00:44.370> once<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.390> throw<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in a loop once you actually throw in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.069 
in a loop once you actually throw in
armor<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> stealth<00:00:46.980> which<00:00:47.930> finally<00:00:48.930> I'm

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
armor and stealth which finally I'm

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.580 
armor and stealth which finally I'm
hoping<00:00:49.440> tomorrow<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:50.039> today<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.449> Saturday<00:00:52.350> if

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
hoping tomorrow or today on Saturday if

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.930 
hoping tomorrow or today on Saturday if

using<00:05:04.449> kind<00:05:05.449> of<00:05:05.510> pointless<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.169> i<00:05:06.199> had<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.740> I

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130

proximity launcher but just kind of

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.010 
proximity launcher but just kind of
pointless<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.330> this<00:05:14.450> map<00:05:14.630> because<00:05:14.840> there's
