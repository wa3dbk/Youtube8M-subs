00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
say that throughout the whole jig that's

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.410 
say that throughout the whole jig that's
what<00:01:05.590> helps<00:01:05.830> our<00:01:05.979> materials<00:01:06.610> stay<00:01:06.909> tight<00:01:07.270> to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
what helps our materials stay tight to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.209 
what helps our materials stay tight to
the<00:01:07.509> body<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.840> never<00:01:08.110> rotate<00:01:08.590> or<00:01:08.710> twist<00:01:08.979> and

the body and never rotate or twist and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:11.700 
the body and never rotate or twist and
now<00:01:10.030> we're<00:01:10.210> going<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.360> wrap<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:11.140> body<00:01:11.350> forward

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
now we're going to wrap the body forward

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.120 
now we're going to wrap the body forward
so<00:01:12.990> wrapping<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.140> body<00:01:14.500> right<00:01:14.590> up<00:01:14.920> against

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
so wrapping that body right up against

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.550 
so wrapping that body right up against
the<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:16.240> hook<00:01:16.450> shank<00:01:16.479> then<00:01:17.290> we're<00:01:17.409> going<00:01:17.500> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
the the hook shank then we're going to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.230 
the the hook shank then we're going to
clip<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.009> tag<00:01:18.219> end<00:01:18.250> off<00:01:18.579> once<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:18.939> get<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
clip the tag end off once we get to the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.330 
clip the tag end off once we get to the
front<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.719> then<00:01:20.680> we're<00:01:20.799> going<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:20.979> wrap<00:01:21.130> our

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
front and then we're going to wrap our

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.950 
front and then we're going to wrap our
way<00:01:21.610> back<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.149> is<00:01:22.329> carrying<00:01:22.719> all<00:01:22.899> that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
way back this is carrying all that

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.690 
way back this is carrying all that
material<00:01:23.380> right<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.070> hook<00:01:24.219> shank<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.610> it

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
material right to the hook shank so it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.260 
material right to the hook shank so it
doesn't<00:01:24.969> move<00:01:25.740> secondly<00:01:26.740> we're<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.119> add

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
doesn't move secondly we're going to add

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.709 
doesn't move secondly we're going to add
our<00:01:31.979> second<00:01:32.979> step<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.369> applying<00:01:33.969> the<00:01:34.390> chenille

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
our second step is applying the chenille

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.330 
our second step is applying the chenille
to<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.289> hook<00:01:35.439> shank<00:01:35.469> we're<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.070> tie<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
to the hook shank we're going to tie it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.660 
to the hook shank we're going to tie it
in<00:01:36.549> by<00:01:37.090> stripping<00:01:37.899> off<00:01:38.140> some<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.250> material

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
in by stripping off some of the material

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.639 
in by stripping off some of the material
right<00:01:39.909> at<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.119> tip<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:41.109> going<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.289> expose

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
right at the tip it's going to expose

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.080 
right at the tip it's going to expose
those<00:01:41.859> threads<00:01:42.219> that<00:01:42.490> hold<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.789> chenille

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
those threads that hold the chenille

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910 
those threads that hold the chenille
together<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:44.020> want<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.289> tie<00:01:44.439> those<00:01:44.560> threads

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
together you want to tie those threads

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.319 
together you want to tie those threads
down<00:01:45.159> because<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.789> base<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
down because that is the base of the

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.330 
down because that is the base of the
chenille<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.869> we're<00:01:47.590> going<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.740> tie<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.039> in

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
chenille and we're going to tie it in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.349
