00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
of titan really but it does speeded up

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
of titan really but it does speeded up
obviously<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> helps<00:01:44.520> it's

like another person basically attacking

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
like another person basically attacking
that<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> duo<00:01:47.280> Slayer<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.820> with

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that it's like a duo Slayer but with

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
that it's like a duo Slayer but with
your<00:01:48.090> own<00:01:48.149> titan<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> still

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
your own titan now one thing I still

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
your own titan now one thing I still
don't<00:01:49.710> understand<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.549> experience<00:01:51.149> are<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
don't understand is the experience are a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.520 
don't understand is the experience are a
little<00:01:51.420> bit<00:01:51.570> different<00:01:51.930> still<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.350> get

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
little bit different still you don't get

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
little bit different still you don't get
as<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.740> slower<00:01:52.950> experience<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.640> killing<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
as much slower experience for killing a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
as much slower experience for killing a
monster<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> used<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.680> guess<00:01:56.040> they're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
monster as you used to I guess they're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
monster as you used to I guess they're
trying<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> rebalance<00:01:56.759> things<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
trying to rebalance things because you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.810 
trying to rebalance things because you
know<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:58.020> everything's<00:01:58.380> multi<00:01:58.950> made<00:01:59.670> their

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
know how everything's multi made their

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.310 
know how everything's multi made their
tactical<00:02:00.210> ways<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.540> Slayer<00:02:00.780> sprint<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.200> it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
tactical ways some Slayer sprint so it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.109 
tactical ways some Slayer sprint so it's
not<00:02:01.439> too<00:02:01.649> overpowered<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.520> mean<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> kind<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
not too overpowered but I mean I kind of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.219 
not too overpowered but I mean I kind of
wish<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.079> now

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
wish it that's are the same because now

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
wish it that's are the same because now
what<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> cannon<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
what if you don't have a cannon or a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.089 
what if you don't have a cannon or a
Titan<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.469> regular

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
not everyone has a Titan nor can they

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.520 
not everyone has a Titan nor can they
always<00:02:11.879> afford

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
always afford

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.199

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.340 
result better for this task in
particular<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.660> yeah<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:48.019> some<00:02:48.140> odd<00:02:48.320> reason

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
particular but yeah for some odd reason

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.110 
particular but yeah for some odd reason
it<00:02:48.650> says<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.130> weakness<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:49.670> task<00:02:49.880> is

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it says is the weakness for this task is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.090 
it says is the weakness for this task is
water<00:02:50.540> spells<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.680> then<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.860> sounds<00:02:52.070> like

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
water spells so and then it sounds like

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.979 
water spells so and then it sounds like
arrows<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.700> next<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.360> no<00:02:53.510> idea<00:02:53.600> why

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
arrows is next so I have no idea why

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.410 
arrows is next so I have no idea why
that<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:55.070> hoping<00:02:55.280> most<00:02:55.730> Slayer<00:02:56.000> tats<00:02:56.239> are

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that is I'm hoping most Slayer tats are

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.640 
that is I'm hoping most Slayer tats are
kind<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.600> weak<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.930> Millie<00:02:57.140> still<00:02:57.440> because

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
kind of weak to Millie still because

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.920 
kind of weak to Millie still because
that<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:57.950> still<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> basic<00:02:58.760> style<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.600> combat

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
that is still the basic style of combat

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.780 
that is still the basic style of combat
for<00:03:00.380> most<00:03:00.560> players<00:03:00.769> for<00:03:01.190> training<00:03:01.519> Slayer<00:03:01.760> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
for most players for training Slayer I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.850 
for most players for training Slayer I
mean<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.209> flat-out<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.200> you'd<00:03:03.530> only<00:03:03.650> see

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
mean it just flat-out it you'd only see

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.440 
mean it just flat-out it you'd only see
too<00:03:03.980> many<00:03:04.040> people<00:03:04.340> bodging<00:03:05.000> for<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> slayer

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
too many people bodging for a slayer

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.430 
too many people bodging for a slayer
