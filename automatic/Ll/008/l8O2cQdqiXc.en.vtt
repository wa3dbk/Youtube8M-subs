00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
said you know very well might be a motor

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.109 
said you know very well might be a motor
mount<00:00:24.260> well<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> go

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.650 

the<00:00:30.449> entire<00:00:30.779> top<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.230> missing<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.210> not

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the entire top is missing so that's not

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.119 
the entire top is missing so that's not
good<00:00:35.930> you<00:00:36.930> notice<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> other<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.559> stayed<00:00:37.980> in

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
good you notice the other one stayed in

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.889 
good you notice the other one stayed in
the<00:00:38.219> car<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> did<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.480> i<00:00:39.510> unbolt

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the car because what I did was i unbolt

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.740 
the car because what I did was i unbolt
at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> bottom<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:41.280> underneath<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.660> i

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
at the bottom from underneath and then i

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
at the bottom from underneath and then i
knew<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.230> sub<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.739> drop<00:00:43.950> out

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
knew that the sub would just drop out

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
knew that the sub would just drop out
and<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> unbolt<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> i'd<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.539> more<00:00:45.690> room

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and i can unbolt the i'd have more room

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
and i can unbolt the i'd have more room
to<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.039> bolt<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.520> both<00:00:47.700> these

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to get to the top bolt on both these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.200 
to get to the top bolt on both these
motor<00:00:48.149> mounts<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.059> came

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
motor mounts well this one just came

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.340 
motor mounts well this one just came
right<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> wasn't<00:00:52.199> even

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
right out with it and it wasn't even

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
right out with it and it wasn't even
both<00:00:52.590> under<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.610> how<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> destroyed

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
both under there that's how to destroyed

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.069 
both under there that's how to destroyed
it<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.809> fell<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.879> obviously

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
it was it just fell out so obviously

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
it was it just fell out so obviously
under<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.140> motor<00:00:58.410> mounts<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:59.520> money<00:00:59.760> well

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
under our motor mounts was money well

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.380 
under our motor mounts was money well
spent

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
spent

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.549 
spent
so<00:01:01.129> there's<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> sub<00:01:02.460> frame<00:01:03.270> image<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so there's the sub frame image you can

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.800 
so there's the sub frame image you can
see<00:01:06.950> I've<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.280> rigged<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.850> actually

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
see I've got this rigged here actually

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.740 
see I've got this rigged here actually
didn't<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.830> hook<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> hook

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
didn't use a hook I just put the hook

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
didn't use a hook I just put the hook
from<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> kit<00:01:13.260> straight<00:01:13.830> through<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.280> little

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
from the kit straight through my little

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
from the kit straight through my little
Deeley<00:01:15.869> Bopper<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:18.530> held<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Deeley Bopper there and held it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
Deeley Bopper there and held it
beautifully<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.700> twist<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.450> did<00:01:21.990> go

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
beautifully just twist these I did go

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.120 
beautifully just twist these I did go
ahead<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.650> another<00:01:22.830> chain<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
ahead and just put another chain I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.340 
ahead and just put another chain I
wrapped<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> around<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.420> case<00:01:24.619> this

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
wrapped it around just in case this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.480 
wrapped it around just in case this
insurance<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> very<00:01:29.159> sturdy

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
insurance but this is a very sturdy

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
insurance but this is a very sturdy
thing<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.090> worried<00:01:30.470> initially<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
thing I was worried initially about the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.330 
thing I was worried initially about the
slope<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> car<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.159> up

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
slope of the car but when you have it up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
slope of the car but when you have it up
in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> air<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.840> slope<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.259> more

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
in the air like this that slope is more

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.929 
in the air like this that slope is more
flat<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.729> pretty<00:01:41.729> good

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
flat so it's pretty good pretty good

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.270 
flat so it's pretty good pretty good
deal<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.299> real<00:01:42.600> solid<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
deal there real solid I like it it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.719 
deal there real solid I like it it's
good<00:01:44.460> $80<00:01:45.000> no<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> could<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.140> done<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
good $80 no way I could have done this

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.639 
good $80 no way I could have done this
trying<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> gun<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.470> put<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
trying to over the gun so I'm just put a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.370 
trying to over the gun so I'm just put a
block<00:01:49.920> underneath<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.750> crank<00:01:51.750> pulley<00:01:51.990> but

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
block underneath the crank pulley but

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.190 
block underneath the crank pulley but
there's<00:01:52.829> no<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.820> job<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> by

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there's no way you do this job by the by

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
there's no way you do this job by the by
the<00:01:58.259> tool<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:59.130> contact<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.790> I'll<00:01:59.909> work<00:02:00.090> out

you<00:02:02.640> ship<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.939> back<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.680> there's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you ship it back so you can see there's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.479 
you ship it back so you can see there's
the<00:02:04.979> other<00:02:05.100> motor<00:02:05.399> mount<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:06.299> connected

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
the other motor mount still connected

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.529 
the other motor mount still connected
but<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> top<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.330> it
