they<00:02:32.510> continue<00:02:32.750> following<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.440> path<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.980> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
they continue following the path and the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.330 
they continue following the path and the
performance<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.240> not<00:02:35.300> degraded<00:02:36.070> here<00:02:37.070> are<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
performance is not degraded here are the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.400 
performance is not degraded here are the
most<00:02:37.550> prides<00:02:37.970> following<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.630> more<00:02:38.900> complex

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
most prides following a more complex

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.670 
most prides following a more complex
path

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
path

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.490

now<00:02:42.579> let's<00:02:42.879> see<00:02:43.120> how<00:02:43.569> well<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.840> works<00:02:44.260> on

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
now let's see how well it works on

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.640 
now let's see how well it works on
mobile<00:02:44.739> devices<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:47.049> an<00:02:47.140> iPhone
