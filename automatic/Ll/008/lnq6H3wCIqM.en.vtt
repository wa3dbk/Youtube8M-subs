playing my Devon her I remember his name
um<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.940> he<00:02:26.570> was<00:02:26.720> right<00:02:26.870> number<00:02:27.080> two<00:02:27.230> same<00:02:27.500> thing

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
um I he was right number two same thing

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.320 
um I he was right number two same thing
Medal<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:27.980> Honor<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.459> when<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.910> surpassed

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
Medal of Honor when I when I surpassed

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.210 
Medal of Honor when I when I surpassed
him<00:02:29.510> for<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.720> number<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:30.110> spot<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.160> guess

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
him for the number one spot so I guess

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.100 
him for the number one spot so I guess
he<00:02:31.430> plays<00:02:31.610> mono<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.090> three<00:02:32.300> as<00:02:32.390> well<00:02:32.630> um

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
he plays mono for three as well um

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.470 
he plays mono for three as well um
basically<00:02:33.950> all<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.280> same<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.000> guess<00:02:35.270> I'd

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
basically all the same so I guess I'd

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.530 
basically all the same so I guess I'd
really<00:02:35.780> drop<00:02:35.989> down<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.290> score<00:02:36.620> wins<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.880> drop

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
really drop down in score wins a drop

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.840 
really drop down in score wins a drop
down<00:02:38.750> again<00:02:39.140> look<00:02:39.380> at<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.730> 40,000<00:02:40.730> now

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.220 
down again look at this 40,000 now
because<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.120> played<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> game<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.840> long<00:02:41.870> time

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
