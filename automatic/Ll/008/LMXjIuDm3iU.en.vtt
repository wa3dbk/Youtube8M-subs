and<00:00:17.609> uh<00:00:17.720> that's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.900> step<00:00:19.140> before<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.710> that's

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and uh that's a step before this that's

and uh that's a step before this that's
where<00:00:20.570> we<00:00:21.570> harvested<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> worms<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
where we harvested the worms out of the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.720 
where we harvested the worms out of the
worm<00:00:22.980> bin<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.390> still<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.710> half<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
worm bin but we still have about half of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
worm bin but we still have about half of
the<00:00:26.820> material<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.320> more

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the material to get out so we have more

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.580

matter if they're small worms big worms

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.840 
matter if they're small worms big worms
it's<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.380> volume<00:02:54.620> thing<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.580> will<00:02:55.700> come

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
it's a volume thing and that will come

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.790 
it's a volume thing and that will come
out<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.150> pound<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.660> instead<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.560> scaling

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
out to a pound so instead of scaling

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.160 
out to a pound so instead of scaling
everyone<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:59.060> easier<00:02:59.390> for<00:02:59.570> me<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.990> fill

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
everyone it's easier for me to just fill

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.410 
everyone it's easier for me to just fill

the Cup on the scale let you see it for

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.010 
the Cup on the scale let you see it for
yourself<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.800> will<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.130> from<00:03:07.370> there

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
yourself that we will go from there

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.320 
yourself that we will go from there
and<00:03:09.280> weigh<00:03:10.280> out<00:03:10.310> some<00:03:10.640> worms<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.030> get<00:03:11.150> them<00:03:11.239> in

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
and weigh out some worms and get them in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.990 
and weigh out some worms and get them in
the<00:03:11.420> package<00:03:14.560> okay<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.370> wanted<00:03:16.880> to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the package okay so I just wanted to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.360 
the package okay so I just wanted to
show<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.440> weighing<00:03:18.440> process<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.280> so

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
show you that weighing process just so

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.070 
show you that weighing process just so
you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.580> see<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.850> for<00:03:20.030> your<00:03:20.150> own<00:03:20.270> eyes<00:03:20.450> here

you can see it for your own eyes here
you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.770> have<00:03:21.980> our<00:03:22.130> scale<00:03:22.400> zeroed

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
you can see we have our scale zeroed

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.890 
you can see we have our scale zeroed
right<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.380> zero<00:03:25.150> I'm<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.360> take<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.720> fill

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
right on zero I'm going to take and fill

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:40.699 
right on zero I'm going to take and fill
the<00:03:27.020> cup<00:03:27.200> up<00:03:28.390> slightly<00:03:29.390> round<00:03:29.810> it

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.399 

and<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> there's<00:03:41.819> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.269> between<00:03:42.569> 208

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
and that there's going to be between 208

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.140 
and that there's going to be between 208
and<00:03:43.709> two<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> quarter<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:44.519> excuse<00:03:44.939> me<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and two and a quarter or excuse me a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.610 
and two and a quarter or excuse me a
pound<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.659> an<00:03:45.780> eighth<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.200> pound<00:03:46.379> in<00:03:46.530> a

pound in an eighth and a pound in a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.170 
pound in an eighth and a pound in a
quarter<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.069> let's<00:03:47.250> set<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> scale<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
quarter so let's set it on the scale and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.429 
quarter so let's set it on the scale and
let's<00:03:48.359> see<00:03:48.510> what<00:03:48.689> we<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:53.569> yep<00:03:54.569> right<00:03:55.319> in

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
let's see what we have and yep right in

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.929 
let's see what we have and yep right in
between<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.799> pound<00:03:56.069> underneath<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> pound

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
between a pound underneath and a pound

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.220 
between a pound underneath and a pound
and<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> quarter<00:03:58.879> okay<00:03:59.879> what<00:04:00.329> we<00:04:00.569> ship<00:04:01.049> your

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and a quarter okay what we ship your

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.129 
and a quarter okay what we ship your
worms<00:04:01.469> in<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:01.980> peat<00:04:02.489> moss<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.090> there's<00:04:03.840> lots

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
worms in is peat moss and there's lots

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.379 
worms in is peat moss and there's lots
of<00:04:04.290> reasons<00:04:04.500> why<00:04:04.980> we<00:04:05.189> use<00:04:05.219> peat<00:04:05.609> moss<00:04:05.790> instead

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
of reasons why we use peat moss instead

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.559 
of reasons why we use peat moss instead
of<00:04:06.599> other<00:04:07.319> materials<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.389> main

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
of other materials but one of the main

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.479 
of other materials but one of the main
ones<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.530> really<00:04:10.829> doesn't<00:04:11.129> have<00:04:11.280> any

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
ones is it really doesn't have any

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.460 
ones is it really doesn't have any
nutrition<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.239> doesn't<00:04:12.569> have<00:04:12.750> any<00:04:12.989> nitrogen

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
nutrition it doesn't have any nitrogen

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.619 
nutrition it doesn't have any nitrogen
it's<00:04:14.099> not<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.730> heat<00:04:14.939> up<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.419> not

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
it's not going to heat up and it's not

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.449 
it's not going to heat up and it's not
going<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.900> hurt<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> worms<00:04:16.380> plus<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.310> has

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
going to hurt the worms plus it has

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.779 
going to hurt the worms plus it has
great<00:04:17.820> airflow<00:04:19.009> when<00:04:20.009> we<00:04:20.160> take<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.519> peat

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
great airflow when we take this peat

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.969 
great airflow when we take this peat
moss<00:04:20.970> here<00:04:21.359> we<00:04:22.259> get<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> right

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
moss here we get it to just the right

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.460 
moss here we get it to just the right
moisture<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.849> this<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.690> probably<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
moisture and this is probably the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.560 
moisture and this is probably the
biggest<00:04:28.470> mistake<00:04:28.740> most<00:04:29.310> beginning<00:04:30.240> worm

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
biggest mistake most beginning worm

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.020 
biggest mistake most beginning worm
farms<00:04:31.050> make<00:04:31.320> as<00:04:31.590> they<00:04:31.770> make<00:04:32.009> this<00:04:32.539> too<00:04:33.949> wet<00:04:35.030> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
farms make as they make this too wet the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.080 
farms make as they make this too wet the
reason<00:04:36.449> why<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.830> don't<00:04:38.039> want<00:04:38.190> your<00:04:38.639> peat<00:04:38.880> moss

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
reason why you don't want your peat moss

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.560 
reason why you don't want your peat moss
to<00:04:39.330> be<00:04:39.449> too<00:04:39.690> wet<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:41.669> need<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.060> airflow

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
to be too wet is you need the airflow

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.360 
to be too wet is you need the airflow
otherwise<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.410> worms<00:04:43.620> are<00:04:43.830> going<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.039> smother

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
otherwise the worms are going to smother

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.120 
otherwise the worms are going to smother
by<00:04:44.699> chipping<00:04:45.210> them<00:04:45.479> dry<00:04:45.810> drier<00:04:46.770> than<00:04:47.010> you

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
by chipping them dry drier than you

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.310 
by chipping them dry drier than you
would<00:04:47.250> ever<00:04:47.280> think<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.880> would<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.930> allows

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
would ever think you would it allows

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.170 
would ever think you would it allows
them<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.620> get<00:04:49.740> air<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.159> they<00:04:50.460> will<00:04:50.639> last<00:04:50.909> much

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
them to get air and they will last much

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.850 
them to get air and they will last much
longer<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.720> being<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.050> lot<00:04:52.260> better<00:04:52.530> shape<00:04:52.830> when

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
longer in being a lot better shape when

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.279 
longer in being a lot better shape when
they<00:04:53.099> get<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.580> now<00:04:54.539> with<00:04:54.599> that<00:04:54.870> said

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
they get to you now with that said

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.830 
they get to you now with that said
because<00:04:56.159> we<00:04:56.550> ship<00:04:56.760> them<00:04:56.909> dry<00:04:57.240> when<00:04:57.690> you

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
because we ship them dry when you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.589 
because we ship them dry when you
receive<00:04:58.229> them<00:04:58.440> understand<00:04:59.430> that<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.360> worms

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
receive them understand that the worms

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.689 
receive them understand that the worms
