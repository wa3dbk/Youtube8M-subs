on<00:00:25.439> magma<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> magma<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.480> bet<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
on magma and magma is just I bet you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.300 
on magma and magma is just I bet you
guys<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.859> all<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> time

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
guys see it all the time

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.990 
guys see it all the time
but<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.130> figured<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> sound

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
but I I think I figured out the sound

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.459 
but I I think I figured out the sound
thing<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> shouldn't<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.410> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
thing so it shouldn't be like this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.190 
thing so it shouldn't be like this
anymore<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.219> apologize<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.050> nose

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
anymore so I do apologize for the nose

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
anymore so I do apologize for the nose
sound<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> hear<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.670> sexy<00:00:39.090> voice

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
sound but you get to hear my sexy voice

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
sound but you get to hear my sexy voice
instead<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> sound<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.829> should<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
instead of the sound so that should be a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
instead of the sound so that should be a
pretty<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.329> trade<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.010> ask<00:00:44.190> myself

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
