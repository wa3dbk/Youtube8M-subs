00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.820 
where that Intel is in relation to that
line<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:35.569> where<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.500> piece

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
line so that's where you get that piece

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.940 
line so that's where you get that piece
of<00:02:36.860> Intel<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.640> chapter<00:02:38.120> 4<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.170> now<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:39.800> two
