00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the north is holding back with the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 masseur and we are back here 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.480
 a new fashion review this time it works 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.530
 on the one hand, if you like the tools and one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.530
 emmerick tools with 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.650
 yes the thing about the motto is it has 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 someone a user who subscribed to me 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.250
 programmed and sent to me 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.509
 I do not have an exact name yet 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.829
 also no minecraft from the entry 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.570
 so far as I know, that's what I'm going to do 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.820
 the media timetable is working with 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.260
 model or and therefore quite simple yes 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.730
 how do you see anything in the see 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.860
 Gods you just need one 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.390
 obsidian is that they are easy in 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.320
 the middle Rhine or comes the four ob 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.790
 you the course 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.620
 yes, we also start with the ob 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.440
 you tools because of me always the ax 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.570
 the pigs and the shovel that swords 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.620
 imagine the shovel again 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 we can not even test 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.019
 Maybe I should get out of the game mode 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
 go out I keep forgetting 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.559
 over and over again today with the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.369
 But I do not want to market 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.049
 do not imagine so I 'm gonna say that 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.689
 that is actually relatively yes how should 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.680
 they say so I would say iron 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.830
 level if I'm a bit stronger 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.330
 even diamonds could do that 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 then find out myself I have none 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.299
 getting the exact granted is so 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.619
 really the exact value I apply 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.290
 you know you're holding a little longer 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.460
 the obsidian of a shovel is think 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.560
 I can stand a little longer than that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.869
 diamond is also logical so the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.070
 We'll also pick it out soon 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.719
 I'll say that's what I think 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.609
 Iron diamonds probably in the same way as you 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.429
 can see we may tell 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.630
 back in the blocks 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.119
 Then I have the ax again 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.490
 show now that I will tell 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.530
 level networker but has the hold 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.030
 wait is relatively long is that 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.890
 the cool thing because of this must 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.659
 you can really stop them if they are too 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.749
 use to make tool because who 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.109
 does it always only need to lead some 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.869
 portal 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.639
 so now to the embedded tools here 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.710
 we also have pickaxe ax and 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.569
 shovel the switzerland I ask you 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.679
 here after before thus the screw catch 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.810
 We'll see you again soon 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.329
 they are a lot faster 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.560
 I would say it's faster than that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.859
 Diamond also with the constant I think 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.359
 times 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.469
 unfortunately you can not do these things yet 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.459
 decide I think it will 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.740
 then I will fix you 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.209
 of course update and see already 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.340
 the ax really gives a lot too much 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.390
 much much brisker than it really is 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.160
 damned fast 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.319
 zack but you can already see it 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.209
 really faster than diamond so now 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 but be pretty heavy and i am 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.959
 just my fashion arena of one 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.190
 nice user mister money is called skype 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.900
 with her and we go sometimes 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.400
 very briefly the cs continue to try on 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.689
 best with a skeleton 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.819
 of course I 'm going out of the game and 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.930
 it again 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.969
 and then skeleton I would say 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.859
 three strokes needs obsidian sword 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.489
 for a skeleton chromosome a skeleton 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.139
 with whether she swears with the 1 2 and 3 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.609
 so it's equally strong I 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.799
 think that if she contains again 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.540
 little longer and yes that's it from 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.980
 this motto I hope you like it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.980
 See you next time
