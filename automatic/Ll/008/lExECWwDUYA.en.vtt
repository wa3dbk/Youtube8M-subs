00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.410 

so<00:00:05.339> today<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> talk<00:00:06.270> about

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.360 
so today we're going to talk about
plowing<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.529> reason<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.069> plow<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
plowing and the reason that we plow the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.490 
plowing and the reason that we plow the
ground<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:09.000> really<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.330> create<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.690> seed<00:00:09.960> bed<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
ground is really to create a seed bed to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.339 
ground is really to create a seed bed to
get<00:00:10.620> rid<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:12.090> trash<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.139> weeds

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
get rid of the the trash and the weeds

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.740 
get rid of the the trash and the weeds
from<00:00:13.679> an<00:00:13.920> old<00:00:14.099> crop<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> nice<00:00:15.210> clean<00:00:15.450> seed

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
from an old crop get a nice clean seed

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.519 
from an old crop get a nice clean seed
bed<00:00:15.960> ready<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.410> sow<00:00:16.590> our<00:00:16.890> fine<00:00:17.220> seeds<00:00:18.050> in<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
bed ready to sow our fine seeds in the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.320 
bed ready to sow our fine seeds in the
spring<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:20.850> wanted<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
spring and I just wanted to make the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.910 
spring and I just wanted to make the
point<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> nature<00:00:22.350> does<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
point that really the nature does this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
point that really the nature does this
for<00:00:23.189> us<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.580> mean<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> hedge<00:00:24.180> over<00:00:24.390> here

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
for us I mean in this hedge over here

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.890 
for us I mean in this hedge over here
well<00:00:25.260> I'll<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.500> show<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:29.810> mean<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
well I'll just show you I mean this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
well I'll just show you I mean this
hedge<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.399> free<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.910> man's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
hedge is is about as free from man's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
hedge is is about as free from man's
influence<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.070> mean

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
influence as we can get and just I mean

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.810 
influence as we can get and just I mean
it's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.520> loose<00:00:36.180> fine<00:00:37.010> really<00:00:38.010> lovely<00:00:38.370> crumb

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it's just loose fine really lovely crumb

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
it's just loose fine really lovely crumb
structure<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.750> wanted<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> sow<00:00:40.260> some

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
structure if I was wanted to sow some

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.740 
structure if I was wanted to sow some
seeds<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.829> would<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.129> exactly<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> was

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
seeds that would be exactly what I was

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.209 
seeds that would be exactly what I was
trying<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> achieve<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> point<00:00:44.100> I'm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
trying to achieve and the point I'm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.729 
trying to achieve and the point I'm
making<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.700> Nature<00:00:45.270> has<00:00:46.170> done<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.710> us

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
making is that Nature has done it for us

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
making is that Nature has done it for us
so<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:47.670> better<00:00:47.940> than<00:00:48.180> farmers<00:00:48.660> ever<00:00:48.899> managed

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so much better than farmers ever managed

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
so much better than farmers ever managed
but<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> point<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.750> couldn't<00:00:51.989> sew<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
but the point is that we couldn't sew a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.930 
but the point is that we couldn't sew a
seed<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.710> their<00:00:52.860> hedge<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.489> it'll<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.850> all

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
seed in their hedge because it'll be all

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
seed in their hedge because it'll be all
the<00:00:54.059> competition<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.289> rid<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the competition we have to get rid of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.430 
the competition we have to get rid of
what<00:00:55.829> nature's<00:00:56.190> provided<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.879> order<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.440> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
what nature's provided in order to to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
what nature's provided in order to to
sow<00:00:58.620> our<00:00:58.649> season<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> suppose<00:00:59.699> that's<00:00:59.910> why

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sow our season and I suppose that's why

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.250 
sow our season and I suppose that's why
there's<00:01:00.449> something<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.809> sort<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> deeply

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there's something that's sort of deeply

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.039 
there's something that's sort of deeply
flawed<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:02.010> farming<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.180> we're

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
flawed about farming and it's we're

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.539 
flawed about farming and it's we're
trying<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.979> sympathetic

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
trying to do in a way that sympathetic

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.039 
trying to do in a way that sympathetic
with<00:01:05.850> nature<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.510> end<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.810> doing

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
with nature but we end up doing

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
with nature but we end up doing
something<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.189> very

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
something which I feel is very

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
something which I feel is very
destructive<00:01:10.250> it's<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> necessary

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
destructive it's the kind of necessary

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.590 
destructive it's the kind of necessary
evil

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
evil

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000 
evil
in<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.110> haven't<00:01:13.260> found<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:13.770> way<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
in that we haven't found a better way of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
in that we haven't found a better way of
doing<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.549> yet<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.990> hope<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> one

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
doing it yet but I really hope that one

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
doing it yet but I really hope that one
day<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:17.759> clowing<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
day we will because I think clowing is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
day we will because I think clowing is
is<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> deeply<00:01:19.799> flawed<00:01:20.250> actually

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is it's kind of deeply flawed actually

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.880 
is it's kind of deeply flawed actually
very<00:01:21.360> traditional<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.200> deeply<00:01:22.530> flawed

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.460 

okay<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:28.950> Chris<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.580> out<00:01:29.730> here<00:01:30.110> plow<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
okay so Chris is out here plow in this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.320 
okay so Chris is out here plow in this
field<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> plowing<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:32.940> we're<00:01:33.060> trying<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
field and plowing what we're trying to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.360 
field and plowing what we're trying to
do<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.570> bury<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.410> trash<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:35.100> rid<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
do is bury all the trash get rid of the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.340 
do is bury all the trash get rid of the
weeds<00:01:35.610> any<00:01:36.120> residues<00:01:36.660> from<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.960> previous

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
weeds any residues from the previous

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
weeds any residues from the previous
crop<00:01:37.560> bury<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.580> nice<00:01:39.060> clean<00:01:39.390> seed<00:01:39.750> bed

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
crop bury that a nice clean seed bed

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.800 
crop bury that a nice clean seed bed
which<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:42.030> probably<00:01:42.180> wait<00:01:42.660> for

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
which then I'm gonna probably wait for

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.300 
which then I'm gonna probably wait for
this<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.960> dry<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.800> two<00:01:43.980> or<00:01:44.010> three<00:01:44.280> days

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
this to dry out for two or three days

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
this to dry out for two or three days
and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.300> we'll<00:01:45.450> come<00:01:45.660> along<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and then we'll come along with we use a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
and then we'll come along with we use a
power<00:01:46.800> Harrow<00:01:47.190> which<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.550> kind<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.940> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
power Harrow which is kind of like a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.530 
power Harrow which is kind of like a
glorified<00:01:49.010> very<00:01:50.010> sophisticated<00:01:50.460> rate<00:01:51.240> that's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
glorified very sophisticated rate that's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
glorified very sophisticated rate that's
both<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.050> break<00:01:52.260> down<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.190> big

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
both which will break down the the big

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.720 
both which will break down the the big
clods<00:01:53.790> into<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> fine<00:01:54.630> crumbly<00:01:55.460> seed<00:01:56.460> bed

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
clods into the fine crumbly seed bed

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.640 
clods into the fine crumbly seed bed
where<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.600> sowing<00:01:57.870> seeds<00:01:58.260> or<00:01:58.560> in

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
where we could be sowing seeds or in

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.690 
where we could be sowing seeds or in
this<00:01:58.770> case<00:01:58.980> we're<00:01:59.190> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.400> planting

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this case we're going to be planting

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:09.390 
this case we're going to be planting
globe<00:02:00.030> artichokes

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.160 

just<00:02:10.400> asking<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:10.910> Chris<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.450> reset<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.960> plow

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
just asking that Chris to reset the plow

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.070 
just asking that Chris to reset the plow
so<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.710> go<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> bit<00:02:12.920> shallower<00:02:13.520> because<00:02:14.000> what<00:02:14.960> we

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
so to go a bit shallower because what we

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.680 
so to go a bit shallower because what we
don't<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.800> put<00:02:16.070> all<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.480> the

don't want to do is put all the all the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.520 
don't want to do is put all the all the
the<00:02:18.200> earthworms<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.270> micro<00:02:21.260> riser

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the earthworms and the the micro riser

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.130 
the earthworms and the the micro riser
and<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.610> invertebrates<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.900> being

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
and the invertebrates that like being

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.600 
and the invertebrates that like being
and<00:02:24.350> most<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.680> them<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.100> be<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> top

and most of them like to be in the top
sort<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.060> three<00:02:26.300> inches<00:02:26.720> where<00:02:26.960> there's<00:02:27.110> lots

matter<00:02:29.600> from<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.110> previous<00:02:30.620> prop<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.460> if<00:02:31.760> you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
matter from the previous prop and if you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.790 
matter from the previous prop and if you
then<00:02:32.000> turn<00:02:32.300> them<00:02:32.480> over<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.170> they're<00:02:33.380> kind

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
then turn them over so that they're kind

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.710 
then turn them over so that they're kind
of<00:02:33.860> eight<00:02:34.190> inches<00:02:34.640> ten<00:02:34.910> inches<00:02:34.940> under<00:02:35.540> they

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
of eight inches ten inches under they

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.940 
of eight inches ten inches under they
don't<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.260> most<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.650> them<00:02:36.770> will<00:02:36.920> die

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
don't like it most of them will die

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.560 
don't like it most of them will die
anything<00:02:37.700> though<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.120> we're<00:02:38.330> really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
anything though and we're really

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.150 
anything though and we're really
dependent<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.170> those<00:02:39.350> organisms<00:02:39.710> in<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.130> soil

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
dependent on those organisms in the soil

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.940 
dependent on those organisms in the soil
so<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:41.480> asking<00:02:41.660> Chris<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> set<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.680> plow

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
so I'm asking Chris just to set the plow

00:02:42.950 --> 00:03:03.030 
so I'm asking Chris just to set the plow
so<00:02:43.280> it'll<00:02:43.430> plow<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> couple<00:02:44.060> inches<00:02:44.740> shallower

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.920 

so<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> modern<00:03:04.610> moldboard<00:03:05.360> plow<00:03:05.450> it's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
so this is a modern moldboard plow it's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.560 
so this is a modern moldboard plow it's
the<00:03:06.080> result<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.850> hundreds<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.940> years<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.420> kind

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the result of hundreds of years of kind

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.320 
the result of hundreds of years of kind
of<00:03:08.690> evolution<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.410> design<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.190> it's<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.120> five

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
of evolution of design and it's a five

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270 
of evolution of design and it's a five
for<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> cloud<00:03:11.960> followed<00:03:12.410> by<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> hundred<00:03:13.190> and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
for a cloud followed by a hundred and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.790 
for a cloud followed by a hundred and
four<00:03:13.700> by<00:03:13.850> 190<00:03:14.540> horsepower<00:03:14.720> tractor

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
four by 190 horsepower tractor

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.230 
four by 190 horsepower tractor
so<00:03:16.010> imagine<00:03:16.250> 190<00:03:17.180> horses<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:20.000> first

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
so imagine 190 horses and the first

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.610 
so imagine 190 horses and the first
thing<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.540> happens<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.930> these<00:03:21.110> bits<00:03:21.410> down

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
thing that happens is these bits down

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.350 
thing that happens is these bits down
here<00:03:22.070> let's<00:03:22.400> point<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.150> one

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
here let's point it out on this one

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.640 
here let's point it out on this one
these<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:23.960> the<00:03:24.050> skins<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:26.080> they<00:03:27.080> they<00:03:27.320> today

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
these are the skins and they they today

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.500 
these are the skins and they they today
take<00:03:27.890> probably<00:03:28.400> an<00:03:28.580> inch<00:03:28.730> or<00:03:28.910> two<00:03:29.090> off<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.330> top

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
take probably an inch or two off the top

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.740 
take probably an inch or two off the top
and<00:03:29.930> fold<00:03:30.140> back<00:03:30.410> down<00:03:30.770> here<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.490> then<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and fold back down here and then the the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.630 
and fold back down here and then the the
rest<00:03:32.990> of<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.230> shear<00:03:33.500> they'd<00:03:33.800> have<00:03:34.010> point<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
rest of the shear they'd have point the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.090 
rest of the shear they'd have point the
wing<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.210> moldboard<00:03:35.680> folds<00:03:36.680> all<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:37.010> this

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
wing and the moldboard folds all of this

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.360 
wing and the moldboard folds all of this
over<00:03:37.550> on<00:03:38.210> top<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.110> lies<00:03:39.370> perfectly

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
over on top of it so it lies perfectly

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.720 
over on top of it so it lies perfectly
inverted<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.690> buried<00:03:41.990> all<00:03:42.080> your<00:03:42.290> trash

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
inverted so you buried all your trash

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.130 
inverted so you buried all your trash
but<00:03:43.730> at<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.850> same<00:03:44.060> time<00:03:44.270> you<00:03:44.420> also<00:03:44.450> put<00:03:44.990> all

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
but at the same time you also put all

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
but at the same time you also put all
those<00:03:45.610> earthworms<00:03:46.930> insects<00:03:47.930> fungi<00:03:48.590> bacteria

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
those earthworms insects fungi bacteria

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.920 
those earthworms insects fungi bacteria
that<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.090> be<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.390> top<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> soil

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that like to be on the top of the soil

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.740 
that like to be on the top of the soil
you<00:03:51.050> then<00:03:51.380> put<00:03:51.590> them<00:03:51.770> six<00:03:52.670> seven<00:03:53.000> eight<00:03:53.150> inches

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
you then put them six seven eight inches

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:04.510 
you then put them six seven eight inches
under<00:03:54.470> which<00:03:55.430> they<00:03:55.550> don't<00:03:55.730> like<00:03:55.880> very<00:03:56.060> much

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.580 

you
