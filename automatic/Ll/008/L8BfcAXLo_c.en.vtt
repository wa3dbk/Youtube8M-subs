them they have the leather right here on
top<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> stretchy

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
top and then you have the stretchy

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.830 
top and then you have the stretchy
cotton<00:00:36.750> material<00:00:36.989> throughout<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.420> and
