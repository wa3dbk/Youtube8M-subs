00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 but scoring goals can always pretend because 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.529
 because I think we had to play what we had the time because 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.939
 they have to play what they know but always difficult to make goals 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.300
 the colombo-argentino cure lóndero great figure of the sport cúcuta del 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.769
 Colombian soccer in the 70s 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.809
 spoke about the 217 goal that got sergio galvan king the weekend 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.060
 past and that allowed him to reach Ivan René Valencian 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.900
 at the top of the historical table of scorers of Colombian football that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.300
 has its merit of course racero and sent a hundred and many goals 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
 well, it was never easy, neither before nor now 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.840
 roma the hardest thing in football is to score goals 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.300
 that's what if he's a goal scorer a little bit atypical let's say he's not he's not 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.090
 the curator of ariari player 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.860
 the one that plays on end he knows how to play he threw himself to the sides he throws himself back 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.830
 but also in powder in defining gold he deserves it is a good player 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 he is also an extraordinary person a great professional 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 and from that that too 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.880
 it is a great merit because it is the merit to the constancy the merit to the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 to good behavior or merit to the good professional 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.060
 that's why 'kubotán' two years ago and that's why he was able to break the record lóndero who 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 now he is a prosperous businessman from cúcuta he was third in the list of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.370
 the historic scorers of Colombian football with 211 goals 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.630
 after leading the act before more than two decades 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 I think if I'm not wrong 24 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 from 81 to 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.950
 I think it was 2006 24 25 years where he believes that the cut of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.440
 Mancera very difficult to overcome is complicated because 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.770
 nowadays the players of 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.610
 who make goals 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.380
 percent e is very difficult 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.719
 for example the case of me I started playing in colombia flattering four 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.659
 years 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.599
 and it was 120 goals in four years 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.389
 then and I kept playing in colombia 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.889
 nowadays the player who in one year has 30 years to 30 hits the other 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.869
 day until when in Europe then 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.429
 It is very difficult 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.749
 that a player can be two feels and both goal in Colombia because it is 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.709
 surely when he starts he starts to make goals and take him to another country 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.419
 then it is very complicated to reach that figure
