whenever<00:00:16.270> um<00:00:16.870> I<00:00:17.620> think<00:00:17.980> that<00:00:18.760> with<00:00:19.540> purples<00:00:20.080> I

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
whenever um I think that with purples I

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.350 
whenever um I think that with purples I
mean<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.740> me<00:00:21.010> I<00:00:21.040> love<00:00:21.400> purples<00:00:21.880> so<00:00:22.150> they're

mean to me I love purples so they're

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.720 
mean to me I love purples so they're
easy<00:00:22.780> to<00:00:22.930> wear<00:00:23.080> for<00:00:23.230> me<00:00:23.350> but<00:00:24.010> I<00:00:24.040> think<00:00:24.130> that<00:00:24.580> if

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
easy to wear for me but I think that if

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.640 
easy to wear for me but I think that if
you're<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> little<00:00:25.600> hesitant<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.140> wear<00:00:26.440> them

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
you're a little hesitant to wear them

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.210 
you're a little hesitant to wear them
it's<00:00:26.950> best<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.850> start<00:00:28.810> off<00:00:29.020> with<00:00:29.380> more<00:00:29.950> cool

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
it's best to start off with more cool

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.070 
it's best to start off with more cool
tone<00:00:30.460> purples<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.090> think<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.419> those<00:00:31.630> tend<00:00:32.020> to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
tone purples I think that those tend to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.850 
tone purples I think that those tend to
work<00:00:32.230> better<00:00:32.470> on<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.830> on<00:00:33.010> most<00:00:33.430> people

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
work better on it on most people

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.600
