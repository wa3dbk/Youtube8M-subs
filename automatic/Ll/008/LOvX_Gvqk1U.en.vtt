00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:02.569 

all<00:00:53.059> right<00:00:53.300> there

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 

pretty<00:01:03.179> much<00:01:03.359> wherever<00:01:03.659> an<00:01:03.899> attack<00:01:04.199> comes

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.710 

okay<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:06.700> managed<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.150> dodge<00:02:07.330> at<00:02:07.540> that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720

time

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.530 

when<00:02:15.890> he<00:02:15.980> throws<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.490> electrical<00:02:17.030> ball<00:02:17.270> is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
when he throws that electrical ball is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.770 
when he throws that electrical ball is
about<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> best<00:02:18.860> time<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.280> attack

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:35.289 

yeah<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.959> not<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> very<00:02:27.530> good<00:02:27.620> shape

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.360 

see<00:02:36.299> what<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> mean<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.290> takes<00:02:37.500> off<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> lot<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.220> HP

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
see what I mean it takes off a lot of HP

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.470 
see what I mean it takes off a lot of HP
very<00:02:38.879> fast

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390 

I<00:02:45.569> just<00:02:46.110> get<00:02:46.319> out<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> way<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.190> not

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I just get out of the way that I'm not

00:02:47.400 --> 00:03:10.920 
I just get out of the way that I'm not
gonna<00:02:47.580> win<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.970> fight

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.809 

yeah<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.200> want<00:03:12.439> to<00:03:12.530> beat<00:03:12.709> him<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:13.249> time<00:03:13.519> I

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
yeah I want to beat him this time I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:36.010 
yeah I want to beat him this time I
can't<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.359> by<00:03:14.480> anything

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.150 

and<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.920> attack<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.370> easy<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.790> dodge

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.870 

I<00:03:45.070> got<00:03:46.070> through<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.400> only<00:03:46.520> getting<00:03:46.790> that

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
I got through that only getting that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.300 
I got through that only getting that
once<00:03:47.180> that's<00:03:47.480> surprising<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.920> beingness

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
once that's surprising the beingness

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:01.940 
once that's surprising the beingness
probably<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.120> most<00:03:53.420> danger<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.050> that

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.980 

in<00:04:02.400> order<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.670> get<00:04:02.880> through<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.300> electricity

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
in order to get through the electricity

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.820 
in order to get through the electricity
like<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:05.400> watch<00:04:05.849> for<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.390> gas<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.200> pop

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
like this just watch for a gas in it pop

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.170 
like this just watch for a gas in it pop
pop

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.990 

when<00:04:15.659> he's<00:04:15.780> charging<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.530> ball<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.760> time

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
when he's charging that ball is the time

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.300 
when he's charging that ball is the time
when<00:04:18.209> he's<00:04:18.329> most<00:04:18.540> wrongful<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:19.560> fun<00:04:20.130> mode

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.700 

the<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:28.210> attack<00:04:28.509> we<00:04:28.659> just<00:04:28.870> did<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.259> one<00:04:29.560> that's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
the the attack we just did is one that's

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.839 
the the attack we just did is one that's
hardest<00:04:30.159> dodged<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:32.129> that's<00:04:33.129> when<00:04:33.699> you're

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
hardest dodged so that's when you're

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.929 
hardest dodged so that's when you're
gonna<00:04:34.029> take<00:04:34.300> damage<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:35.499> then<00:04:35.710> I'm<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.699> pretty

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
gonna take damage and then I'm in pretty

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:46.750 
gonna take damage and then I'm in pretty
good<00:04:37.060> shape<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.569> time

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.740 

you<00:04:47.760> can<00:04:47.880> get<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.120> pretty<00:04:48.150> good<00:04:48.420> about<00:04:48.630> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
you can get it pretty good about a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.980 
you can get it pretty good about a
damage<00:04:49.140> in<00:04:49.290> on<00:04:49.440> it

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.170 

he's<00:04:56.990> about<00:04:57.199> half<00:04:57.379> that<00:04:57.409> of<00:04:57.680> an<00:04:57.949> 82%

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.310 

how<00:05:05.180> do<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.300> get<00:05:05.450> through<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.720> only<00:05:05.930> taking

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
how do I get through that only taking

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.420 
how do I get through that only taking
one<00:05:06.590> hit

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.710 

ouch<00:05:17.370> yeah<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.880> hurts

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.930 

I<00:05:22.750> want<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.620> when<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.890> put<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.280> electricity

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
I want that when you put the electricity

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.150 
I want that when you put the electricity
gas<00:05:25.150> in<00:05:25.420> the<00:05:25.540> center<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.560> way<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.770> can<00:05:27.010> do<00:05:27.130> a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
gas in the center that way I can do a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.770

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
that was a missed opportunity

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.150 
that was a missed opportunity
but<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:37.970> shouldn't<00:05:38.210> matter<00:05:38.450> unless<00:05:39.160> something

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
but it shouldn't matter unless something

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.650 
but it shouldn't matter unless something
terrible<00:05:40.790> happens<00:05:41.270> I<00:05:43.330> should<00:05:44.330> be<00:05:44.480> able<00:05:44.540> to

don't know why it didn't track me

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.829 
don't know why it didn't track me
because<00:06:14.059> I<00:06:14.149> didn't<00:06:14.449> move<00:06:14.629> an<00:06:14.839> inch<00:06:16.509> there<00:06:17.509> got

having to rely on the nitrous which I'm
not<00:06:33.619> even<00:06:33.919> sure<00:06:34.129> they<00:06:34.339> have<00:06:34.580> nitro<00:06:35.089> switches

and levels anymore because you're

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.619

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
expected to slow them up with this

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:46.239 
expected to slow them up with this
