we put in the oil they put that in there

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.969 
we put in the oil they put that in there
so<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.969> you<00:01:53.299> can<00:01:53.409> so<00:01:54.409> they<00:01:54.530> kind<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.859> run

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
so that you can so they kind of run

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.169 
so that you can so they kind of run
through<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.280> engine<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:55.670> kind<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:55.939> clean<00:01:56.149> out

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
through the engine to kind of clean out

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.270 
through the engine to kind of clean out
the<00:01:56.450> engine<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.409> don't<00:01:57.619> want<00:01:57.859> that<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the engine you don't want that in the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370 
the engine you don't want that in the
water<00:01:58.520> pump<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.479> particular<00:01:59.749> water<00:02:00.079> pump

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
water pump on this particular water pump

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.370 
water pump on this particular water pump
the<00:02:00.530> Karcher<00:02:01.299> 2500<00:02:02.299> series<00:02:02.509> water<00:02:02.840> pump<00:02:03.170> is

the Karcher 2500 series water pump is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260 
the Karcher 2500 series water pump is
which<00:02:03.530> one<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:03.920> use<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.850> want<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.119> make<00:02:05.240> sure

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
which one we use you want to make sure

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.899 
which one we use you want to make sure
you<00:02:05.479> use<00:02:05.719> this<00:02:05.960> non<00:02:06.619> detergent<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.820> it

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
you use this non detergent so that it

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.340 
you use this non detergent so that it
doesn't<00:02:08.210> foam<00:02:08.450> up<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.780> there<00:02:08.899> because<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.170> put

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
doesn't foam up in there because you put

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.230 
doesn't foam up in there because you put
water<00:02:09.530> foam<00:02:10.310> together<00:02:10.520> then<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> big

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
water foam together then you have a big

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.449 
water foam together then you have a big
problem<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.989> very<00:02:12.230> important<00:02:12.709> step<00:02:12.950> when

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
problem it's a very important step when

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.630 
problem it's a very important step when
you're<00:02:13.550> servicing<00:02:13.909> this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
you're servicing this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.770 
you're servicing this
so<00:02:14.790> I'll<00:02:14.850> set<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.150> over<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> tripod

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so I'll set you over here on the tripod

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.030 
so I'll set you over here on the tripod
and<00:02:16.080> I'll<00:02:16.170> show<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> how<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.710> started

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and I'll show you how we get started

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
and I'll show you how we get started
here<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:17.850> here's<00:02:18.060> your<00:02:18.120> spark<00:02:18.450> plug

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
here all right here's your spark plug

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.180 
here all right here's your spark plug
just<00:02:18.870> pull<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> off<00:02:19.560> take<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.310> 13/16<00:02:22.190> break

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
just pull that off take a 13/16 break

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.090 
just pull that off take a 13/16 break
that<00:02:23.370> loose<00:02:26.030> okay<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.330> pull<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.870> plug

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.680 

kind<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.190> hard<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.330> out<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.540> there

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
kind of hard to get in and out of there

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.250 
kind of hard to get in and out of there
I<00:02:33.870> should<00:02:34.710> have<00:02:34.800> probably<00:02:35.010> taken<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:35.820> off

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
I should have probably taken this off

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.420 
I should have probably taken this off
but<00:02:37.260> I'm<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> show<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
but I'm going to show you just so you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.580 
but I'm going to show you just so you
can<00:02:38.550> get<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.820> out<00:02:39.080> without<00:02:40.080> taking<00:02:40.440> an<00:02:40.500> air

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
can get it out without taking an air

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.580 
can get it out without taking an air
cleaner<00:02:40.800> out<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.820> see<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> spark<00:02:42.330> plug

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
cleaner out you can see the spark plug

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.170 
cleaner out you can see the spark plug
it's<00:02:43.590> got<00:02:43.830> some<00:02:44.100> fatigue<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:44.940> too

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's got some fatigue on it's not too

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's got some fatigue on it's not too
bad<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.140> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.709> okay<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.100> we're<00:02:47.850> going

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
bad it's a kind of okay but we're going

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.220 
bad it's a kind of okay but we're going
to<00:02:48.030> replace<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.420> that's<00:02:48.660> part<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.930> our<00:02:49.080> two

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to replace this that's part of our two

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.100 
to replace this that's part of our two
nut<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:50.880> we're<00:02:51.030> using<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.660> its<00:02:51.840> place

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
nut and what we're using in its place

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
nut and what we're using in its place
we're<00:02:52.590> using<00:02:52.709> an<00:02:52.920> NG<00:02:54.020> kb6

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
we're using an NG kb6

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770 
we're using an NG kb6
es<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> found<00:02:56.820> works<00:02:57.060> best<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.630> this

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
es it's what I found works best in this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.190 
es it's what I found works best in this
engine<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:59.310> when<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> took<00:02:59.790> out<00:02:59.940> snot<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.270> not

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
engine that when I took out snot a not

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.280 
engine that when I took out snot a not
NGK<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.430> using<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.480> ng<00:03:03.810> k<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.020> think

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
NGK but I like using the ng k I think

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.650 
NGK but I like using the ng k I think
it's<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> great<00:03:04.709> plug<00:03:05.040> works<00:03:05.880> great<00:03:06.270> for<00:03:06.570> these

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it's a great plug works great for these

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380 
it's a great plug works great for these
smaller<00:03:07.470> engines<00:03:07.920> okay<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:09.090> we're<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
smaller engines okay so we're going to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.630 
smaller engines okay so we're going to
go<00:03:09.480> ahead<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.720> put<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.400> there's<00:03:11.400> really

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
go ahead and put this in there's really

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.460 
go ahead and put this in there's really
not<00:03:11.850> much<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:12.810> replacing<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
not much you have to do replacing a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.620 
not much you have to do replacing a
spark<00:03:13.739> plug<00:03:13.800> they're<00:03:14.220> pretty

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
spark plug they're pretty

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.990 
spark plug they're pretty
straightforward<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.140> simple<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.850> we're<00:03:17.970> just

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
straightforward and simple so we're just

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
straightforward and simple so we're just
going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.270> thread<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:24.709> alright<00:03:25.709> it's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
going to thread this in alright it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.320 
going to thread this in alright it's
always<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> good<00:03:26.340> idea<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.910> make<00:03:27.090> sure<00:03:27.239> you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
always a good idea to just make sure you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600 
always a good idea to just make sure you
get<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.510> couple<00:03:27.870> good<00:03:28.019> threads<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.739> before

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
get a couple good threads on it before

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.940 
get a couple good threads on it before
you<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> socket<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:31.769> definitely

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
you put the socket on it you definitely

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.610 
you put the socket on it you definitely
don't<00:03:32.190> want<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.459> strip<00:03:32.670> out<00:03:32.820> these<00:03:33.000> heads<00:03:33.620> and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
don't want to strip out these heads and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.660 
don't want to strip out these heads and
then<00:03:34.739> just<00:03:34.860> put<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.130> there<00:03:35.340> kind<00:03:35.519> of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
then just put that on there kind of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.229 
then just put that on there kind of
lightly<00:03:37.640> tighten<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.730> down

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
lightly tighten it down

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.070

this<00:04:11.519> quite<00:04:11.820> often<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.299> probably<00:04:12.540> do<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.959> once

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
this quite often I probably do this once

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.699 
this quite often I probably do this once
a<00:04:13.320> month<00:04:14.510> because<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.930> outdoor<00:04:16.320> machine

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
a month because it's an outdoor machine

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.180 
a month because it's an outdoor machine
and<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.419> pulls<00:04:18.630> off<00:04:18.900> pretty<00:04:19.739> simple

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
and that just pulls off pretty simple

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.620 
and that just pulls off pretty simple
then<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.260> take<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.620> off<00:04:23.630> okay

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
then this you just take this off okay

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.719 
then this you just take this off okay
and<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.410> can<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:25.830> wash<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.610> you

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
and you can actually wash this if you

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.310 
and you can actually wash this if you
want<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.060> just<00:04:27.300> spray<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.539> off<00:04:27.750> with

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
want I just spray it off with

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.590 
want I just spray it off with
carburetor<00:04:28.950> cleaner<00:04:29.330> then<00:04:30.330> we're<00:04:30.420> going<00:04:30.540> to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
carburetor cleaner then we're going to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.200 
carburetor cleaner then we're going to
take<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:30.930> off<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.730> then<00:04:32.730> that's<00:04:32.910> all<00:04:33.090> you

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
take this off and then that's all you

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.600 
take this off and then that's all you
have<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.690> what<00:04:33.990> I'm<00:04:34.080> going<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.290> do<00:04:34.380> now<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.550> I'm

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
have and what I'm going to do now so I'm

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.830 
have and what I'm going to do now so I'm
just<00:04:35.730> going<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> take<00:04:36.090> some<00:04:36.120> throttle<00:04:36.660> body

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
just going to take some throttle body

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.380 
just going to take some throttle body
cleaner<00:04:37.170> now<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.070> throttles<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.090> here

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
cleaner now the throttles right here

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.510 
cleaner now the throttles right here
this<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:40.170> activates<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.980> throttle<00:04:41.370> back

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
this is what activates the throttle back

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.640 
this is what activates the throttle back
and<00:04:41.730> forth<00:04:41.970> because<00:04:42.660> it's<00:04:43.020> not<00:04:43.170> like<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.320> gear

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and forth because it's not like a gear

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.080 
and forth because it's not like a gear
shifter<00:04:44.070> or<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.280> foot<00:04:44.580> pedal<00:04:44.730> that's

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
shifter or a foot pedal that's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.270 
shifter or a foot pedal that's
spring-loaded<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.470> one<00:04:46.740> I'm<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:46.890> going<00:04:47.190> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
spring-loaded this one I'm just going to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.640 
spring-loaded this one I'm just going to
use<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.820> kind<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.060> lube<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.390> up<00:04:48.480> so<00:04:49.470> what<00:04:49.590> I

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
use this to kind of lube it up so what I

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.740 
use this to kind of lube it up so what I
do<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.580> I'll<00:04:50.640> just<00:04:50.790> take<00:04:51.000> some<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.420> spray

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
do so I'll just take some of this spray

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.490 
do so I'll just take some of this spray
I'll<00:04:52.650> spray<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.010> right<00:04:53.220> inside<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:55.260> I'll<00:04:55.350> just

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
I'll spray it right inside and I'll just

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.400 
I'll spray it right inside and I'll just
kind<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.770> move<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.010> back<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.370> forth<00:04:57.080> okay<00:04:58.080> and

this<00:05:43.280> manifold<00:05:44.280> here<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:44.970> I<00:05:45.000> have<00:05:45.240> to<00:05:45.330> do<00:05:45.390> is

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
this manifold here so I have to do is

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.840 
this manifold here so I have to do is
just<00:05:45.750> take<00:05:45.930> those<00:05:46.200> bolts<00:05:46.710> out<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.190> just<00:05:47.700> slide

you can come in maybe hit it with some

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.290 
you can come in maybe hit it with some
compressed<00:06:14.220> air<00:06:14.460> just<00:06:14.730> kind<00:06:14.940> of<00:06:15.000> blow<00:06:15.120> that

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
compressed air just kind of blow that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.390 
compressed air just kind of blow that
out<00:06:15.480> and<00:06:16.290> that's<00:06:16.560> what<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.740> found<00:06:17.070> that<00:06:17.190> works

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
out and that's what I found that works

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.540 
out and that's what I found that works
best<00:06:17.670> doing<00:06:18.030> this<00:06:18.180> normal<00:06:18.870> maintenance<00:06:19.050> and

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
best doing this normal maintenance and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.060 
best doing this normal maintenance and
so<00:06:20.550> there<00:06:20.700> you<00:06:20.760> go<00:06:20.990> all<00:06:21.990> right<00:06:22.050> to<00:06:22.530> reinstall

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
so there you go all right to reinstall

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.550 
so there you go all right to reinstall
this<00:06:23.360> take<00:06:24.360> these<00:06:24.540> two<00:06:24.750> levers<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.230> just<00:06:25.410> kind

up over the top kind of slide that back
into<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.910> throttle<00:06:36.870> body<00:06:36.990> there<00:06:37.940> bring<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:38.970> in

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
into the throttle body there bring it in

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.840 
into the throttle body there bring it in
and<00:06:40.020> that's<00:06:40.620> pretty<00:06:40.889> much<00:06:41.009> all<00:06:41.310> there<00:06:41.490> is<00:06:41.520> to
