very well but here's another game mode
as<00:04:03.489> well<00:04:03.519> that's<00:04:03.819> available

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
as well that's available

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.449 
as well that's available
like<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.659> battle<00:04:05.050> arena<00:04:05.319> where<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.040> score

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
like a battle arena where you score

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.990 
like a battle arena where you score
points<00:04:06.700> by<00:04:06.909> taking<00:04:07.420> out<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.659> other<00:04:07.750> races<00:04:08.590> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
points by taking out the other races and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.490 
points by taking out the other races and
it's<00:04:10.000> quite<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.299> small<00:04:10.569> environment<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.319> race

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
it's quite a small environment to race

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.530 
it's quite a small environment to race
around<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.099> clicked<00:04:12.489> loads<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.450> loads

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
around and you clicked loads and loads

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.250 
around and you clicked loads and loads
of<00:04:13.720> weapons<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.200> just<00:04:14.379> fire<00:04:14.590> them<00:04:14.739> office

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
of weapons and just fire them office

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.060 
of weapons and just fire them office
it's<00:04:17.260> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.440> make<00:04:17.530> people<00:04:17.769> draw

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it's going to make people draw

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.890 
it's going to make people draw
comparisons<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.729> Mario<00:04:19.090> Kart<00:04:19.389> again<00:04:19.600> because

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
comparisons to Mario Kart again because

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.569 
comparisons to Mario Kart again because
obviously<00:04:20.049> Mario<00:04:20.560> Kart<00:04:20.859> has<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.190> mode<00:04:21.430> as

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
obviously Mario Kart has this mode as

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.879 
obviously Mario Kart has this mode as
well<00:04:21.609> but<00:04:22.449> I<00:04:22.900> think<00:04:23.350> there's<00:04:23.500> enough<00:04:23.710> variety

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
well but I think there's enough variety

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.180 
well but I think there's enough variety
in<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.610> types<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.090> weapon<00:04:25.419> on<00:04:25.540> offer<00:04:26.190> well

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
in the types of weapon on offer well

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.159 
in the types of weapon on offer well
yeah<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> think<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:28.540> that's<00:04:28.780> what<00:04:29.020> you're

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
yeah I think that that's what you're

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.840 
yeah I think that that's what you're
buying<00:04:29.320> you're<00:04:29.620> buying<00:04:29.800> almost<00:04:30.220> endless

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
buying you're buying almost endless

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.310 
buying you're buying almost endless
amounts<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.180> content<00:04:31.449> whenever<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.169> get

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
amounts of content whenever you get

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.060 
amounts of content whenever you get
little<00:04:32.949> big<00:04:33.100> planet<00:04:33.130> pretty<00:04:34.090> much<00:04:34.330> yeah<00:04:38.070> just

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
little big planet pretty much yeah just

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.510 
little big planet pretty much yeah just
depends<00:04:39.460> what<00:04:39.580> your<00:04:39.699> attention<00:04:40.060> span<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.330> like

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
depends what your attention span is like

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.550 
depends what your attention span is like
yes<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.789> mean<00:04:42.910> one<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:44.440> not

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
yes I mean one of the it's not

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.879 
yes I mean one of the it's not
necessarily<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.160> problem<00:04:46.410> but<00:04:47.410> one<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
necessarily a problem but one of the

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.439 
necessarily a problem but one of the
challenges<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.820> think<00:04:48.880> perhaps<00:04:49.240> the

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
challenges I think perhaps the

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.990 
challenges I think perhaps the
downloadable<00:04:50.169> maps<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.760> how

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
downloadable maps have is that how

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.189 
downloadable maps have is that how
exactly<00:04:52.630> do<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.310> highlight<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.580> good<00:04:55.210> track

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
exactly do you highlight a good track

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.430 
exactly do you highlight a good track
you<00:04:56.889> know<00:04:57.039> because<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.760> when<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.090> are<00:04:58.440> 10

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
you know because that when there are 10

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.200 
you know because that when there are 10
million<00:04:59.889> downloadable<00:05:00.520> tracks<00:05:00.789> let's<00:05:01.030> say

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
million downloadable tracks let's say

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.290 
million downloadable tracks let's say
how<00:05:01.900> do<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.199> find<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:02.830> one<00:05:03.280> amazing<00:05:04.000> track

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
how do you find that one amazing track

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.080 
how do you find that one amazing track
now<00:05:04.930> they've<00:05:05.289> done<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.500> fairly<00:05:06.100> good<00:05:06.220> job<00:05:06.789> of

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
now they've done a fairly good job of

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.469 
now they've done a fairly good job of

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
they're just labeled as cool so that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.900 
they're just labeled as cool so that
kind<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:20.620> helps<00:05:20.860> narrow<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.430> down<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.639> little

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
kind of helps narrow it down a little

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.710 
kind of helps narrow it down a little
bit<00:05:22.090> more<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:24.210> one<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.360> things<00:05:25.419> always

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
bit more but one of the things always

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.210 
bit more but one of the things always
found<00:05:25.930> with<00:05:26.139> little<00:05:26.380> big<00:05:26.500> planet<00:05:26.530> in<00:05:26.919> general
