00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
is engaged at this point now what we're

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.980 
is engaged at this point now what we're
going<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.740> show<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.190> here<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.150> comparison

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
going to show you here is the comparison

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.700 
going to show you here is the comparison
between<00:01:00.290> smoothness<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.400> sensitivity

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
between smoothness and sensitivity

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.399 
between smoothness and sensitivity
between<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.129> mach3<00:01:04.400> clutch<00:01:05.000> sensor<00:01:05.720> flex<00:01:06.110> and

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
between the mach3 clutch sensor flex and

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.460 
between the mach3 clutch sensor flex and
the<00:01:06.920> competition<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.390> as<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.600> begin<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.170> raise

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the competition so as I begin to raise

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.399 
the competition so as I begin to raise
the<00:01:09.740> air<00:01:09.860> pressure<00:01:10.479> watch<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.810> spring<00:01:12.110> scale

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
the air pressure watch the spring scale

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.550 
the air pressure watch the spring scale
on<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.220> sensor<00:01:13.729> flex<00:01:13.970> clutch<00:01:14.299> as<00:01:14.630> compared<00:01:15.229> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
on the sensor flex clutch as compared to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.670 
on the sensor flex clutch as compared to
the<00:01:16.040> competitions<00:01:16.760> clutch<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.560> will

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
the competitions clutch and you will

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.490 
the competitions clutch and you will
note<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.700> sensor<00:01:20.210> flex<00:01:20.479> begins<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
note that the sensor flex begins to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.800 
note that the sensor flex begins to
engage<00:01:21.790> very<00:01:22.790> smoothly<00:01:23.710> much<00:01:24.710> earlier<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
engage very smoothly much earlier and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.789 
engage very smoothly much earlier and
much<00:01:26.810> less<00:01:27.049> violently<00:01:27.790> than<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.000> competition

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
much less violently than the competition

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.770 
much less violently than the competition
so<00:01:30.799> we're<00:01:31.010> approaching<00:01:31.220> 4<00:01:31.790> psi<00:01:32.330> which<00:01:32.750> is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
so we're approaching 4 psi which is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.840 
so we're approaching 4 psi which is
about<00:01:33.140> where<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.470> Mach<00:01:33.830> 3<00:01:34.130> will<00:01:34.340> begin<00:01:34.640> to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
about where the Mach 3 will begin to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.940 
about where the Mach 3 will begin to
engage<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.930> can<00:01:36.080> see<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.470> spring<00:01:36.710> scale

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
engage and you can see the spring scale

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.789 
engage and you can see the spring scale
is<00:01:37.159> gradually<00:01:38.060> beginning<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.510> move<00:01:38.799> you'll

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
is gradually beginning to move you'll

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.750 
is gradually beginning to move you'll
note<00:01:40.040> there's<00:01:40.280> been<00:01:40.460> no<00:01:40.700> change<00:01:40.729> over<00:01:41.450> here

note there's been no change over here

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.219 
note there's been no change over here
and<00:01:43.869> as<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:45.049> go<00:01:45.229> up<00:01:46.180> we're<00:01:47.180> still<00:01:47.229> increasing

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and as we go up we're still increasing

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.109 
and as we go up we're still increasing
in<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.409> very<00:01:48.619> smooth<00:01:49.010> manner<00:01:49.040> by<00:01:49.670> small

over<00:02:02.119> here<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:04.420> suspect<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:05.929> we<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.170> close<00:02:06.439> to

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
over here I suspect when we get close to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.969 
over here I suspect when we get close to
seven<00:02:07.069> psi<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.080> competitors<00:02:09.679> clutch

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
seven psi that the competitors clutch

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.170 
seven psi that the competitors clutch
will<00:02:10.220> begin<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.700> engage<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.480> rather<00:02:11.930> abruptly

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
will begin to engage and rather abruptly

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.390 
will begin to engage and rather abruptly
watch<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.480> spring<00:02:14.780> scale<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.010> are<00:02:16.040> just

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
watch this spring scale here we are just

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.960 
watch this spring scale here we are just
there<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.730> goes<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.239> just<00:02:17.390> began<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.970> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
there it goes it just began and it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.449 
there it goes it just began and it
nicely<00:02:20.510> demonstrates<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.739> second

feature that we want to point out and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.319 
feature that we want to point out and
that<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.610> smoothness<00:02:27.879> compared<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.000> sets

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329

ours<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.730> they<00:02:37.940> both<00:02:38.150> reacted<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> same<00:02:38.810> way

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
ours and they both reacted the same way

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.979 
ours and they both reacted the same way
the<00:02:39.440> same<00:02:39.590> spring<00:02:39.890> scale<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.390> not<00:02:41.510> fixed

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the same spring scale so it's not fixed

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.699 
the same spring scale so it's not fixed
in<00:02:42.110> any<00:02:42.230> way

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
you slow it down you get the same thing

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.059

last thing we want to talk about here is
the<00:03:26.609> way<00:03:26.639> these<00:03:26.970> things<00:03:27.030> are<00:03:27.419> constructed

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
the way these things are constructed

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.280 
the way these things are constructed
that<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.500> difference<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.129> construction

that the difference of the construction

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.240 
that the difference of the construction
in<00:03:31.290> terms<00:03:31.349> of<00:03:32.480> heat<00:03:33.480> dissipation<00:03:34.250> you'll

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
in terms of heat dissipation you'll

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.119 
in terms of heat dissipation you'll
notice<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.540> tomate<00:03:36.900> three<00:03:37.290> cents<00:03:38.040> of
