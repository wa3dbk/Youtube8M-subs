00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
a sort of game in the Civilization

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.869 
a sort of game in the Civilization
series<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.829> would<00:02:51.310> say<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.669> would<00:02:51.760> be<00:02:51.819> like

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
series I would say it would be like

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.659 
series I would say it would be like
Civilization<00:02:52.780> Revolution<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.639> a

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
Civilization Revolution but that's not a

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.059 
Civilization Revolution but that's not a
bad<00:02:54.970> thing<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.689> case<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.290> meant<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.829> be

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
bad thing in this case it's meant to be

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.349 
bad thing in this case it's meant to be
a<00:02:57.370> shorter<00:02:58.169> session<00:02:59.169> gameplay<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.849> you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
a shorter session gameplay so that you

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.690 
a shorter session gameplay so that you
can<00:03:01.629> sit<00:03:01.870> down<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.409> play<00:03:02.620> an<00:03:02.889> entire<00:03:03.040> match

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
can sit down and play an entire match

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.970 
can sit down and play an entire match
and<00:03:04.030> maybe<00:03:04.389> a<00:03:04.540> couple<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.109> hours<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.709> not

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
and maybe a couple of hours if not

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.659 
and maybe a couple of hours if not
shorter<00:03:06.639> you<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.919> customize<00:03:08.919> each<00:03:09.250> time<00:03:09.549> you

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
shorter you can customize each time you

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.580 
shorter you can customize each time you
play<00:03:09.909> so<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.689> have<00:03:10.900> upwards<00:03:11.169> of

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.189 
opportunity aside from the fact that
there's<00:04:06.340> no<00:04:06.519> multiplayer<00:04:06.939> right<00:04:07.479> now<00:04:07.659> it's

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
there's no multiplayer right now it's

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.710 
there's no multiplayer right now it's
the<00:04:08.409> fact<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.799> um<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.849> yes<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.299> say<00:04:10.479> right<00:04:10.689> now

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
the fact that um and yes I say right now

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.270 
the fact that um and yes I say right now
because<00:04:11.139> I'm<00:04:11.259> hoping<00:04:11.439> there<00:04:11.739> will<00:04:11.829> be<00:04:11.889> a<00:04:11.979> patch

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
because I'm hoping there will be a patch

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.640 
because I'm hoping there will be a patch
or<00:04:12.579> some<00:04:12.759> sort<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.030> DLC<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.569> adds<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.139> but<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.590> I

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
or some sort of DLC that adds it but I I

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.469 
or some sort of DLC that adds it but I I
think<00:04:15.280> it's<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.759> fact<00:04:15.909> that<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.209> ships

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
think it's the fact that the ships

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.629 
think it's the fact that the ships
themselves<00:04:17.049> are<00:04:17.199> not<00:04:17.349> super<00:04:17.889> customizable

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
themselves are not super customizable

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.580 
themselves are not super customizable
you<00:04:18.759> can't<00:04:19.030> adjust<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> colors<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:20.380> can't

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
you can't adjust the colors you can't

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.310 
you can't adjust the colors you can't
rename<00:04:20.979> them<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:22.090> can<00:04:22.270> load<00:04:22.750> them<00:04:22.930> out<00:04:23.080> any

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
rename them you can load them out any

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.839 
rename them you can load them out any
way<00:04:23.529> you<00:04:23.560> want<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.070> ultimately<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.820> just

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
way you want but ultimately you just

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.160 
way you want but ultimately you just
want<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.330> get<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.659> higher

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
want to get the higher

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.720 
want to get the higher
numbers<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.710> want<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.010> load<00:04:27.190> them<00:04:27.370> out<00:04:27.490> with

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
numbers you want to load them out with

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.940 
numbers you want to load them out with
as<00:04:27.880> much<00:04:28.090> stuff<00:04:28.360> as<00:04:28.540> possible<00:04:29.170> because<00:04:29.740> you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
as much stuff as possible because you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.740 
as much stuff as possible because you
want<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.370> be<00:04:30.460> able<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.730> take<00:04:30.970> down<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.360> enemy

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
want to be able to take down the enemy

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.410 
want to be able to take down the enemy
the<00:04:32.230> real<00:04:32.530> more<00:04:33.040> fun<00:04:33.400> ownership<00:04:34.090> would<00:04:34.270> be

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
the real more fun ownership would be

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.570 
the real more fun ownership would be
renaming<00:04:35.020> them<00:04:35.380> maybe<00:04:35.680> customizing<00:04:36.430> their

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
renaming them maybe customizing their

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.400 
renaming them maybe customizing their
looks<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:37.030> little<00:04:37.150> bit<00:04:37.420> but<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.720> can't<00:04:37.930> do<00:04:38.170> that

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
looks a little bit but you can't do that

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.410 
looks a little bit but you can't do that
the<00:04:38.680> game's<00:04:38.860> not<00:04:38.980> meant<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.490> do<00:04:39.640> that

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
the game's not meant to do that

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.720 
the game's not meant to do that
if<00:04:40.630> anything<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.320> feel<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.920> starships

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
if anything I feel like that starships

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.150 
if anything I feel like that starships
might<00:04:43.000> be<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> proof<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.570> concept<00:04:43.780> for<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> much

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
might be a proof of concept for a much

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.150 
might be a proof of concept for a much
larger<00:04:45.490> game<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.390> maybe<00:04:46.570> Sid<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.770> the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
larger game that maybe Sid and the the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.490 
larger game that maybe Sid and the the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
case for $15 I would run right now and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.750
