00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 another question that was very very often opposite sex but it takes 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.940
 what did it change as information what is it like 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 to pass what can be told all that one can know about vadim 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 and well to try to represent his long 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.949
 I want to say that it will be like a conversation we can have with 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.609
 his best friend actually as for him shared information from the north of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.489
 felt of the rescue vehicle she was not even of how do you see them 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.130
 things 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 they came to the paz began it seems and blah blah blah blah blah this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.270
 kind of information and the animal will applaud context the same source 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 amd the only topics that will be provided by the appropriate aft to date from his 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 hiring oracle there are exceptions but let's be honest they are when 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.520
 even rare it is not actually about all this information that is 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.760
 the order of the abstract and of course blow for example time 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 the time as we have it will make smile anderson minutes and 1 second is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.420
 unconscious in abstract reality 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 first by for all my deeds most animals 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 so in this case both make them do France to something that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 does not belong to the concert 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 for example the aircraft program and I speak in terms of the sun when I want 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 speak in terms of me i speak in terms of the eu 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.460
 and when I want to introduce the notion of duration at the end of the day with 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.939
 a goal of the polish jelen quercia altair come the day missions that night 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.180
 and day and night to pass m 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260
 that day siddicates the kind of situation 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.800
 he sometimes we are going anyway any impressions an extra 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.790
 it's it or not but let's be honest it's actually that it goes very 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.440
 specific 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.240
 on the other hand for everything that falls afp ducros felt how to kill 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.680
 the animal lives things so there I was accepted to a host of information 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.440
 that we stop an accident I can say in a film very very very addictive 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.470
 so yes but it's really not easy we almost feel that 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 it is him who makes live an adventure and in this case by advancing the army 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.649
 the full of emotions in general a paradox it is 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.480
 there are movies on the streif to have access to your if someone tells you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.409
 how things went for him 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.979
 there may be some distance between us at the fck the person with 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.159
 humor but there in the context of communication with an image that there is 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.159
 it's great that for a few moments 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.029
 the animal is not just the breakdowns on what happened what will we 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:37.089
 to do if you think he felt fortunately fortunately dynamic 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.279
 because for some cases if it's time it's still 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.019
 preferable 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.120
 but waits some 106 points on the i in his sneakers finally good if we can 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.220
 say that for an animal 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.760
 for a few minutes and feel things that he has felt since 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.670
 his position then said in terms of information so it's actually 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.060
 much richer than we could for example trade between 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.160
 friends in ten years so yes I lived stuff that I felt that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.329
 the raise is going to get away with real 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.790
 it's still a little different so it's really easy
