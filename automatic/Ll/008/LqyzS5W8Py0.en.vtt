00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.180 
see it's a pretty average side with the
best<00:01:23.910> player<00:01:24.240> player<00:01:24.570> being<00:01:24.900> 66<00:01:25.710> ray<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
best player player being 66 ray and I

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.710 
best player player being 66 ray and I
think<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.730> to<00:01:26.880> check<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.480> board

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
think not to check out what the board

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
think not to check out what the board
expects<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.200> us<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.500> season<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.760> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
expects of us this season and that is to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
expects of us this season and that is to
reach<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.570> round<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> 32<00:01:31.080> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> cup<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
reach the round of 32 in the cup and to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
reach the round of 32 in the cup and to
gain<00:01:32.670> automatic<00:01:33.330> promotion<00:01:33.510> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.050> league

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
gain automatic promotion in the league

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
gain automatic promotion in the league
so<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.800> think<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.190> will<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.550> chopped<00:01:35.910> to<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so I think that will be chopped to the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
so I think that will be chopped to the
first<00:01:36.960> player<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.320> approach<00:01:37.620> is<00:01:37.770> Hector

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
first player we approach is Hector

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
first player we approach is Hector
Bellerin<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.700> 1<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.120> player<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.480> previous

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
Bellerin a 1 and player from previous

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450 
Bellerin a 1 and player from previous
career<00:01:40.200> mode<00:01:40.410> he's<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> lot

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
career mode he's a right back with a lot

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.070 
career mode he's a right back with a lot
of<00:01:41.490> pace<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.730> sensual<00:01:42.330> we're<00:01:42.600> doing

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
of pace and sensual we're doing

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.450 
of pace and sensual we're doing
something<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.650> always<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.430> I'm

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
something which I always do when I'm

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
something which I always do when I'm
using<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.330> smaller<00:01:45.570> club<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> that's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
using a smaller club and that's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
using a smaller club and that's
approaching<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.890> loan<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> player<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.730> have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
approaching to loan the player but have

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730 
approaching to loan the player but have
a<00:01:47.910> fee<00:01:48.330> for<00:01:48.360> them<00:01:48.900> at<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.230> end<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> year

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
a fee for them at the end of the year

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
a fee for them at the end of the year
and<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.460> 2.2<00:01:51.090> million<00:01:51.330> should<00:01:51.690> be<00:01:51.840> enough

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and I think 2.2 million should be enough

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810 
and I think 2.2 million should be enough
for<00:01:52.140> Bella<00:01:52.350> rit<00:01:52.590> next<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.460> hit<00:01:53.520> list<00:01:53.580> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
for Bella rit next on the hit list is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.070
