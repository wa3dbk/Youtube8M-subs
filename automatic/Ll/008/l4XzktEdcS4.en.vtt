00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 more money there is no problem why 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.330
 the lady can return within 30 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.890
 days when he received what you have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 ordered if you want returned us vi 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870
 we refund or replace watch 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.320
 here with whomever he wants 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.740
 I ask 309 the code of this set two 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 yesterday in tempered glass a small 20 x 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 30 and 1 large 30 x 40 19 euros 95 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 cents 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.519
 see that I have glass Italians 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 but a very strange meter is a glass that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.040
 he is not afraid to take the knocks he has 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 afraid to take neither cuts nor the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.170
 temperature nor of course hygiene 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 because this erects in the maximums and pesto 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 avoids evoking however it is a glass 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 stabilized and a stole glass and glass 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 that doesn't do these things here anymore 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 first point the averages of microbes as already 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
 we know them and then burn them 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.309
 if I'm going to put a pan in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.580
 cooking on a cutting board is plastic 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 both of wood I burn everything and we can 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 also use economic for which 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 let's go together if we get up to do 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 see how we're cooking but I have to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.930
 do nothing look at full steam kitchen 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.689
 I write that which does not stand still 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.229
 turn off turn off take yes go on 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 together 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.840
 we support but without pity and without fear 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.560
 and stoneline and we're talking about two of them 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.180
 tempered glass cutting boards 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 very resistant you can cut without 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.369
 pity on these cutting boards because not not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 they break you can use them like 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 trivets can also be more 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 delicate cover and mark it takes 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.490
 prove that they are the maximum of 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
 resistance however are two riklis faults 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.420
 in fact they are also the maximum 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.969
 hygiene because of glass so yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.060
 can wash now usually is of 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.590
 exact new total way you can 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.409
 put in the dishwasher of course 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.459
 they have silicone feet 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.720
 already attached look to move beautiful 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.150
 I'm making tomato and mozzarella 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.069
 to show the tomato on what 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.769
 mozzarella must rest before finishing 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.860
 in our plate not on a cutting board is 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.410
 a nest of bacteria but must rest on 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 glass on or on our cutting boards 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 mike starr for example we also have 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.739
 very good but these are the materials 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.049
 hygienic these are also the materials 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.959
 Solids are the materials that also last 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.970
 the barriers to this are its security 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.629
 to have a cutting board that resists the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.150
 shock that resists any cut 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.879
 just going to stake me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.700
 I'm going to ruin the knife 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.230
 here in front of what is resisting 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 let's move together a little growing 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.000
 we arrive here in front is resisting 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.720
 at the cooking temperature of an ason 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 line of a rome more than history among 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.780
 the other one comes to mind marco 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 that we can also leave them beautifully 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.920
 view our cutting boards and use them too 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.900
 as a table top for when we are 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430
 really proposing cooking we must 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.840
 place the spoon the sad and the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.290
 ashes and in any case they are also beautiful from 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.569
 to see 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.609
 certainly and the silicone feet of which you 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.750
 I spoke we can see them now here it is 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.489
 working 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.209
 here they are see below are here 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.500
 look almost not seen 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.720
 four corners to all four 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.030
 corners are so delicate that if me 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 I go delicate I mean dead morbid 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.599
 that if I go to put down a cutting board 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.290
 on the other cutting board this way 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.849
 here I can raise them and fly 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.859
 they remain as if they were attacked but 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.489
 is not a sucker oh no we are not 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.579
 speaking 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.739
 adherence to the large silicone 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.709
 softness and the anti- king and the adherence of 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.660
 silicone but in fact first show vila la 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.700
 plate the lady tried to turn it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.819
 I wanted facilitated by moving the cutting board 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:04.489
 no efforts exited I remained 400 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.489
 309 of the code of this set of two
