00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
lot of options you pretty much do the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 
lot of options you pretty much do the
same<00:00:29.279> exact<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.119> isn't<00:00:30.420> sound

a<00:00:33.210> little<00:00:33.360> bit<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.110> isn't<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.559> lot

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a little bit but there just isn't a lot

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
of options with its life that means at

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.100 
of options with its life that means at
very<00:00:37.200> small<00:00:37.320> lightweight<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.850> bright<00:00:39.809> light

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
very small lightweight and bright light

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
very small lightweight and bright light
for<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> size<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.430> light<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.850> talking

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
for the size the light I was talking

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.860 
for the size the light I was talking
about<00:00:42.559> here<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.040> LED<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> obsession

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
about here is the LED or the obsession

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.970 
about here is the LED or the obsession
led<00:00:46.020> by<00:00:46.800> chhavi<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:48.600> light<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.530> probably

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
led by chhavi and this light it probably

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.880 
led by chhavi and this light it probably
weighs<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.370> six<00:00:51.030> pounds<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.690> one's<00:00:52.680> even

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
weighs about six pounds this one's even

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
weighs about six pounds this one's even
smaller<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.120> last<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> did

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
smaller than the last one that I did

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.040 
smaller than the last one that I did
which<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.980> atmospheric<00:00:56.460> RG<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
which was the atmospheric RG as you can

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.189 
which was the atmospheric RG as you can
see<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.280> small<00:00:59.840> compact<00:01:00.840> light

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
see it's just a very small compact light

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
see it's just a very small compact light
and<00:01:02.030> there's<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> lens<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> front<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.850> very

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and there's the lens in front and very

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
and there's the lens in front and very
simple<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.659> show<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> does

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
simple and show it to you what it does

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.899 
simple and show it to you what it does
on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.850> ceiling<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:10.549> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on the ceiling here this is what the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.390 
on the ceiling here this is what the
lights<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.770> I'm<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.979> tapping<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.520> light

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
lights on and I'm just tapping the light

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.510 
lights on and I'm just tapping the light
so<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.970> moonflower<00:01:18.689> effect<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so this is a moonflower effect and it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
so this is a moonflower effect and it
has<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.850> seven<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.360> eight<00:01:21.479> colors<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
has like seven or eight colors of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
has like seven or eight colors of
different<00:01:22.439> patterns<00:01:23.150> reason<00:01:24.150> why<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
different patterns reason why I say it's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.859 
different patterns reason why I say it's
in<00:01:25.070> dmx<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.549> useless<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
in dmx it's kind of useless this is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
in dmx it's kind of useless this is
pretty<00:01:28.049> much<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.040> mean<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
pretty much all it does I mean as you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
pretty much all it does I mean as you
travel<00:01:30.000> faster<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> cool<00:01:31.950> spinning

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
travel faster it's a cool spinning

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
travel faster it's a cool spinning
effect<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.960> any<00:01:34.110> spinning

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
effect you don't have any spinning

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.420 
effect you don't have any spinning
effects<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.159> light<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:36.170> multi<00:01:37.170> colors<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
strobes by the way running lights that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
strobes by the way running lights that
are<00:01:43.890> still<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.430> green<00:01:45.299> blue<00:01:45.659> red<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> white

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
so it's as you can see my window over

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.300 
so it's as you can see my window over
there<00:01:59.960> shining<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.590> quite<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> bit<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.130> light

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
there shining and quite a bit of light

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.040 
there shining and quite a bit of light
which<00:02:01.580> i<00:02:01.670> realized<00:02:02.390> when<00:02:02.510> i<00:02:02.630> did<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:02.870> video

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
which i realized when i did this video

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.640 
which i realized when i did this video
but<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:04.070> still<00:02:04.670> quite<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.940> bit<00:02:05.120> brighter<00:02:05.650> with

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
but you still quite a bit brighter with

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.020 
but you still quite a bit brighter with
less<00:02:06.920> light<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.460> moon<00:02:07.610> with<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.850> lights

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
less light in the moon with the lights

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.270 
less light in the moon with the lights
off<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.610> gets<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.280> really

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
off so it really gets going and really

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.970 
off so it really gets going and really
cool<00:02:16.550> effect<00:02:16.880> because<00:02:17.180> if<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.950> know

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
cool effect because if you have you know

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.030 
cool effect because if you have you know
several<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:20.260> different<00:02:21.260> lights<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.650> lasers

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
several of different lights like lasers

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.240 
several of different lights like lasers
or<00:02:22.310> wash<00:02:22.490> effects<00:02:22.970> or<00:02:23.330> even<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.770> polkadot

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
or wash effects or even the the polkadot

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.280 
or wash effects or even the the polkadot
style<00:02:25.700> lights<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> revo<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.080> stuff

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
style lights like the revo and stuff

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.890 
style lights like the revo and stuff
like<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> different<00:02:29.390> kind<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
like that this is a different kind of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.570 
like that this is a different kind of
effect<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.590> kind<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.830> break<00:02:31.070> up<00:02:31.250> your<00:02:31.400> light

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
effect so it kind of break up your light

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.460 
effect so it kind of break up your light
show<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> little<00:02:32.000> bit<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.360> give<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.840> different

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
show a little bit and give a different

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.740 
show a little bit and give a different
look<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> part<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.820> dance<00:02:35.000> floor<00:02:35.180> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
look to part of the dance floor it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.400 
look to part of the dance floor it
doesn't<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:36.530> wide<00:02:36.680> beam<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.230> can

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
doesn't have a very wide beam so you can

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.229 
doesn't have a very wide beam so you can
kind<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.770> decide<00:02:40.250> where<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.820> want<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> be

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
kind of decide where you want it to be

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.290 
kind of decide where you want it to be
and<00:02:41.709> that's<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.340> know<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.610> good<00:02:43.850> thing<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.239> think

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
and that's you know a good thing I think

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.390 
and that's you know a good thing I think
especially<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.260> type<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.709> light<00:02:45.920> and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
especially in this type of a light and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.610 
especially in this type of a light and
of<00:02:46.610> course<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.209> farther<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.600> throw<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
of course the farther you throw it the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.280 
of course the farther you throw it the
bigger<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.040> gets<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.790> I'd<00:02:50.450> say<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:50.989> now<00:02:51.140> I'm

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
bigger it gets so I'd say right now I'm

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.160 
bigger it gets so I'd say right now I'm
throwing<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.739> about<00:02:52.209> I'd<00:02:53.209> say<00:02:53.570> about<00:02:53.780> eight

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
throwing it about I'd say about eight

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.570 
throwing it about I'd say about eight
feet<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.320> probably<00:02:57.320> about<00:02:57.440> five<00:02:58.220> feet

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
feet and it is probably about five feet

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.460 
feet and it is probably about five feet
wide<00:02:58.880> right<00:02:59.270> now<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.959> gives<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.260> some

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
wide right now so that gives you some

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.810 
wide right now so that gives you some
idea<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:02.360> throw<00:03:03.140> on<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.440> thing<00:03:03.820> well

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
idea of the throw on this thing well

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.120 
idea of the throw on this thing well
here<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.209> down<00:03:05.420> here<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:06.130> tapping

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
here it is down here I'm just tapping

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.910 
here it is down here I'm just tapping
away<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.230> kind<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.530> what<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
away on it and this is kind of what the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.400 
away on it and this is kind of what the
lens<00:03:10.400> looks<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.180> going<00:03:11.410> kinda

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
lens looks like that it's going kinda

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.570 
lens looks like that it's going kinda
cool<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.640> there<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.780> obsession<00:03:15.230> led<00:03:15.580> by

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
cool so there it is the obsession led by

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.209 
cool so there it is the obsession led by
shah<00:03:16.940> they
