of shifted stick is in the middle this
position<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.500> called<00:01:06.650> neutral<00:01:07.600> position<00:01:08.600> make

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
position is called neutral position make

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.280 
position is called neutral position make
sure<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.220> shifted<00:01:10.670> stick<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.300> neutral

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
the car is started we will shift into

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.230 
the car is started we will shift into
first<00:01:18.799> gear<00:01:19.390> then<00:01:20.390> go<00:01:20.870> to<00:01:20.930> second<00:01:21.620> gear<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.240> so

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
first gear then go to second gear and so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.649 
first gear then go to second gear and so
on<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.530> want<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:25.040> reverse<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.700> car<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.450> will

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
on if we want to reverse the car we will

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.830 
on if we want to reverse the car we will
shift<00:01:26.900> into<00:01:27.200> reverse<00:01:27.409> gear<00:01:28.479> when<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.570> car<00:01:29.810> is

shift into reverse gear when the car is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.890 
shift into reverse gear when the car is
stopped<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:31.549> transmission<00:01:32.240> should<00:01:32.510> be<00:01:32.659> put

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
stopped the transmission should be put

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.289 
stopped the transmission should be put
