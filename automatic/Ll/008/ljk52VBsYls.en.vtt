 hello friends I want to share with you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.130
 your experience how to charge the phone 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:15.199
 not having suddenly having a charger 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.210
 analog either on the phone is broken there is input 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.369
 charger and you really love 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 then the phones and whatever you want them 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 I think I think everyone will be in 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.550
 the desk drawer at home there abandoned old 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 there are chargers from the old 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 unnecessary phone there or broken 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:41.879
 I tell the phone how to do it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.050
 take the phone take the battery look 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.230
 all batteries have a designation 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.250
 where is he plus where is he minus here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.329
 take the charger is not necessary and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 cut off the entrance see the red wire and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.960
 black wire is plus and minus that is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.270
 it is clear here we take the phone from 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.010
 disconnect the piece of paper there with something 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.770
 contacts to prevent any 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.049
 closings so that we do not violate this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:28.130
 work the phone take the battery 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:33.420
 oh next we do and neatly 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:41.540
 We connect here to contacts where is plus 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:47.509
 where minus minus and all this should be done 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:54.640
 so that it all gets right here 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:59.510
 we put the battery phone 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 we set we close then we take the charger 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.920
 We put the device in the outlet and wait 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 how much he needs there 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.420

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.610
