00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.480
 track numbers 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.800
 small form is such small 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.619
 the bag means even a dispute was opened with 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.739
 seller but the seller extended during and 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.250
 in general, the parcel really came 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 so it is with us 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:50.199
 capacitive stylus means for what is best 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.899
 applied he means to so 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.730
 it is used for those yes firstly 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.980
 you need there on where can 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.179
 used on the tablet horde on 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.080
 Smartphone iPhone and Ipad's 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:09.509
 it is used for those who allow 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.990
 big fingers 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.880
 here or on the screen small icons 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.549
 or someone 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 does not want prints on the screen 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.470
 what else that scratched the screen up 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.240
 This is the shape of the pen 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 made so not pressed 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.640
 it means the color of this particular seller 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.390
 without the right to choose colors there in my opinion 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.170
 there were about eight about 8 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.009
 10 probably such a normal color blue 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.330
 wrong here now we will take 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.909
 any 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.490
 devices and test it like it 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.899
 works so let's continue here we have 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.860
 tablet give now try 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.299
 draw something to the example so well 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.630
 how is it going 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.360
 that you did not reflect here see if 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 something can someone do lessons 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.540
 or something 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.410
 you can write yes there examples 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.590
 any 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.110
 have some sort of a message to someone to 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.760
 here you can write an example here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.460
 so this whole thing happens 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.410
 absolutely normal is adequate nothing 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.620
 it is not necessary to press everything is fine 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.830
 working here you can choose something 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.830
 there 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.100
 This program is such a condo 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.400
