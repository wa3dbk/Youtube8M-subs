think there was other aspects but I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.260 
think there was other aspects but I
think<00:00:59.690> for<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> majority<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.649> people

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
think for the majority of it people

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
think for the majority of it people
traveled<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.660> Australia<00:01:04.409> from<00:01:04.650> New<00:01:04.799> Zealand

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940 
four-month but having brought come back
I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.820> were<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.150> um<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I think they were really um you know I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.780 
I think they were really um you know I
guess<00:01:32.790> hesitant<00:01:33.450> knowing<00:01:33.960> whether<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:35.430> would

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
guess hesitant knowing whether he would

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.240 
guess hesitant knowing whether he would
not<00:01:36.450> stay<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> whole<00:01:37.680> time<00:01:37.920> whether

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
not stay for the whole time whether

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
not stay for the whole time whether
something<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:38.729> happen<00:01:38.909> he<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.450> leave<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
something would happen he would leave so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.649 
something would happen he would leave so
they<00:01:40.500> rushed<00:01:40.799> him<00:01:41.100> into<00:01:41.130> an<00:01:41.820> Extreme<00:01:42.450> Rules

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
they rushed him into an Extreme Rules

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.620 
they rushed him into an Extreme Rules
match<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.500> saying<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> match<00:01:43.950> was<00:01:44.100> bad<00:01:44.329> but<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
match not saying the match was bad but I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
match not saying the match was bad but I
think<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.530> could<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.799> been<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.250> more

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
think it could have been a lot more

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810 
think it could have been a lot more
special<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.740> know<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.250> after
