a<00:01:11.400> flat<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.880> wagner<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.380> know

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a flat in wagner on the right and i know

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
a flat in wagner on the right and i know
i<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.560> champ<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.979> he<00:01:16.979> could<00:01:17.130> throw<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> matt

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
i have champ so he could throw to matt

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
i have champ so he could throw to matt
he<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.180> go<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> tight<00:01:18.540> end<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:18.869> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
he could go to the tight end now but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
he could go to the tight end now but
eventually<00:01:19.770> once<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> Titan<00:01:20.820> gets<00:01:20.970> over

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
eventually once the Titan gets over

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.370 
eventually once the Titan gets over
towards<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> numbers<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> Titans<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
towards the numbers the Titans going to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.690 
towards the numbers the Titans going to
get<00:01:22.470> covered<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:23.130> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> cover<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
get covered so I don't need to cover the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340 
get covered so I don't need to cover the
tight<00:01:23.909> end<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.540> after<00:01:25.220> this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.760 

so<00:01:30.350> right<00:01:30.619> now<00:01:31.690> when<00:01:32.690> wagner<00:01:33.080> sits<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.560> sees

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
so right now when wagner sits and sees

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.710 
so right now when wagner sits and sees
him<00:01:33.979> I<00:01:34.159> know<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.369> don't<00:01:34.729> need<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.060> cover<00:01:35.540> the
