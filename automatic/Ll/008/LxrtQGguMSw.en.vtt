00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
it's absolutely the fastest pc that you

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's absolutely the fastest pc that you
can<00:01:02.820> build<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.510> built<00:01:03.720> by<00:01:03.900> main

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
can build right now it's built by main

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.530 
can build right now it's built by main
gear<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.250> four<00:01:05.700> titans<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
gear and it's got four titans in it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
gear and it's got four titans in it
which<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.990> fastest<00:01:07.530> GPU<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.160> of<00:01:08.490> course

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
which is our fastest GPU and of course

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
which is our fastest GPU and of course
their<00:01:08.910> water<00:01:09.150> cooled<00:01:09.509> with<00:01:09.660> EK<00:01:10.050> blocks<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
their water cooled with EK blocks you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
their water cooled with EK blocks you
can<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.550> got<00:01:11.700> corsair<00:01:12.300> Memory<00:01:12.660> in<00:01:12.780> there

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
can see it's got corsair Memory in there

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
can see it's got corsair Memory in there
i<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.320> 16<00:01:13.710> gig<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.100> where's<00:01:14.490> it's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
i think there's 16 gig or where's it's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.950 
i think there's 16 gig or where's it's
64<00:01:15.090> gig<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> memory<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.800> it's<00:01:16.950> 64<00:01:17.490> yeah

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
64 gig of memory i I think it's 64 yeah

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
64 gig of memory i I think it's 64 yeah
memory<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.380> got<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> nice<00:01:19.830> beautiful<00:01:20.220> corsair

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
memory it's got a nice beautiful corsair

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
memory it's got a nice beautiful corsair
case<00:01:21.119> there's<00:01:21.660> actually<00:01:21.990> even<00:01:22.290> believe<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.160> or

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
case there's actually even believe it or

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
case there's actually even believe it or
not<00:01:23.750> corsair<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.050> hands<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.680> let's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
not corsair for hands down here let's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
not corsair for hands down here let's
see<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:26.729> open<00:01:26.910> there<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.630> go

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
see if i can get that open there we go

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.620 
see if i can get that open there we go
so<00:01:28.710> he's<00:01:28.830> one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.369> guys<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> of

system that guy go in again that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.400 
system that guy go in again that's
definitely<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> beast<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> system<00:01:36.410> actually

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
definitely a beast of a system actually

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.249 
definitely a beast of a system actually
one<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> fastest<00:01:38.670> pcs<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.539> anybody<00:01:40.110> can

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
one of the fastest pcs that anybody can

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.250 
one of the fastest pcs that anybody can
build<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.679> now

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.900 

well<00:01:43.860> we're<00:01:44.010> shown<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.190> lot<00:01:44.370> of<00:01:44.430> great<00:01:44.640> comments

course<00:01:52.260> shield<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.220> saw<00:01:53.400> some<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
course shield and I saw some of the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.000 
course shield and I saw some of the
systems<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.110> splinter<00:01:55.470> cell<00:01:55.740> is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
systems that the splinter cell is

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.130 
systems that the splinter cell is
running<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.430> before<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.300> corsair<00:01:57.690> here<00:01:57.930> too

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
running on before some corsair here too

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
running on before some corsair here too
yeah<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.800> does<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.850> at<00:01:59.940> if

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
yeah it does actually to go look at if

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
yeah it does actually to go look at if
there's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.330> water-cooled<00:02:00.960> corsair<00:02:01.380> kids<00:02:01.650> i

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
there's a water-cooled corsair kids i

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.610 
there's a water-cooled corsair kids i
think<00:02:02.400> it's<00:02:02.490> called<00:02:02.580> h80<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.690> YH<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
think it's called h80 it's YH is the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.710 
think it's called h80 it's YH is the
