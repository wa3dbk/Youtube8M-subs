00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.319
 it is at the end of Saint-Michel to mouriÃ¨s in the valley of the leases of 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.380
 Provence 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.680
 that we are going to discover how from this little fleshy fruit to 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.429
 stones 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.490
 and manufactured today it's only yesterday that olive oil from the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.490
 valley of the baux de provence 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.479
 after daily harvest olive growers wear to break eggs 

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.439
 books or saint-michel 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 florence rossi son of christian rossi is the owner of the mill reception 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.680
 with his team several tons of fruit every day 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.850
 it is 16 these moves of bass drum 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 before starting what is called here the trituration 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.280
 but the operation of extracting the oil but at the level of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.310
 saturation 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.380
 is divided into four stages 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.880
 the journey the mixing 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.430
 the separation of the strength of the link 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.320
 to finish with a last mechanical action 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 separation of oil and vegetation water at least not for the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.730
 producer has but the season is there 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 between the moment of receipt so badly of the crushing of this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.480
 folder 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 % and its costs about four hours 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.570
 a more like worker what is called to respect glass 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.570
 so immediately pick up immediately traced 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.220
 sometimes at harvest time 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.130
 some leaves mix with fake 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.200
 to remove it before trituration the olive trees goes through a step that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.090
 I'm called stripping 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 the olives are then washed to remove all traces of soil 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 no more drip before being crushed 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.740
 the Tunisian movement baby record stores 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.840
 a little mean the most 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.650
 the right way online 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.790
 and down middle mountain that the flesh my middle east or 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.590
 so the kernel is now and we're going to be broke 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.340
 and so how to get a dough 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.070
 and percent once one has retained this dough sfk mahalla dough 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.550
 knead it 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.560
 the pana a little near 40 to 45 minutes 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.120
 to fatigue this dough to work 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.549
 at one year the word gizzards 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.189
 because 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.839
 passionate to seize him from him 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.629
 directly to a very long trip 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.559
 we could not do it 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.559
 this dough is work 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.969
 the third stage of trituration and the separation of the solid and 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.049
 liquid 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.469
 it is using a horizontal centrifuge that the dough is divided into 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.569
 two parts 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.179
 on one side the core and the skin of the olive tree on the other side of the water 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.609
 vegetation he eludes to mix 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.620
 the nucleus is there to be called the winning goal 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.979
 and keep 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.979
 it will be used as fertilizer and this in olive orchards 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.199
 there is no tarte tatin 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.819
 off cac 40 arkema 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.939
 Why 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.829
 get him green from the oms 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.829

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.579
 patrick ouart passage 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 alstom cajarcois not let them reproduce 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.359
 africa we did our part in the project 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.349
 but the speed of the qualities so we have four days pass and who respects the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.669
 cross 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.169
 the billion-door 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.479
 marginalize them the good end but let's assume residual trituration 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.409
 they are recovered to be extended as the union 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.519
 in the olive groves 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.359
 the production of olive oil is a totally natural process 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.929
 without recoil addition of products cited and without any waste for the USSR 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.929
 we can talk here about pure fruit juice 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.490
 the cellars of the miller's cellar so-called civilians 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.799
 these are now well filled 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.109
 the cities of the valley of the baux de provence and benefits since 1997 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.109
 the duo also has and that is to say of a controlled label of origin 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.139
 this certification guarantees, among other things, authenticity and typicity 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.049
 of its geographical origin 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.829
 and it is for this reason that the olive oil of the valley of the leases of 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:16.699
 Provence 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.419
 a unique group is inimitable
