00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello and welcome for this new text of this device phone pda 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.230
 tactile 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.250
 in a white box 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.730
 so what is called in white box in fact it is that the device has 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.279
 not cashed a mark 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.389
 it's a power the Bermuda Islands 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.009
 the car l 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.070
 And more and more 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.269
 of time you will see its charger 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.489
 emma 8s 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.489
 qualities 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.690
 the usb cable 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.560
 because the device we're watching 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.200
 to an adapter for a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.430
 we can more symbolic 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.300
 we can put the prisons to sme 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.740
 but I have not tested but I saw that 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.130
 but I think it's not very reliable 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.140
 and then a second hat-trick 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.050
 not resorting to mark the penthrite at this imposing 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 in fact it's one of the peculiarities of this device his abilities his 1800 put 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 earthen 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 climate see here 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.320
 so his 1800 planted 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 so you can compare with gottéron laptops in general how do you 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.860
 say on the phone battery that is about 3800 first set up 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 second back of the device 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.460
 two sim cards 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.560
 which allows you after to switch from one to the other 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.630
 and actually having a personal phone for purposes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.820
 professional 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 a location for the compactflash 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 yannick rosé 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.380
 but I do not know why have they scored a year 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.210
 they scored for our character 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.830
 so similar 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.869
 this one to take the wind up the serial number 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.450
 CCTC 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.940
 Saturday in me I presume the state apparatus refused to yield 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.780
 on the internet selling the head and if it's cool thickening 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.570
 but it's true that when you plug in pc you can see that it's more 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 simple and this one then went 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.640
 and should be effective 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 start up the device 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.079
 here we go 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.109
 so I do not know how to handle that little red card that was in the boot 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.669
 so maybe someone to encrypt them and I hope there is no 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.949
 marked one can explode at any time 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.959
 e al-chifa for me 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.069
 so in the device two small speakers everything allows to have a 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.819
 are still quite powerful the camera that also allows for 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.879
 make camera 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 there is pressure on the device and we arrive at the menu a small audio clip 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.419
 the device 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.749
 and touch 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.239
 but you have invested the console this one finds three days what I have 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.239
 seen on a photo that had a small style 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.869
 so that allows you 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.269
 to play videos 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.229
 gfr 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.389
 then there to spend more time 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.699
 and after that it could be said finally they have to wait 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 for four years that I speak only by singing upright 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.689
 clearly that the device 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.430
 placed in them 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 in fact the device is directly connected for computer usb port 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.939
 and there my computer well recognize him automatically 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 we leave for the videos 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 you have to disconnect 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.399
 nice and videos 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.719
 so there are already two videos embedded in the device 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.719
 the first to be matrix 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:49.269
 re vincent 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.829
 6 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.469
 to know that the 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:06.849
 quite complex and 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 so the qualities is more than correct 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.929
 calls and sms the directory access to the camera file 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.230
 we find the functions 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.330
 could not be more conventional of the device 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.599
 the setting to switch the most important 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.800
 from one sim card to another 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 the sima the target will you have a square meter 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.449
 we will return to the following functions menu 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.439
 the awakening all under the gunning tooling with young people on the 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.189
 network 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.910
 we will keep finding 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.750
 the tories the chronicle home agents that saddens universal that is 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.259
 little girl is a little game 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.699
 so it's a device that works 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.080
 rather not bad 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.780
 the autonomy is pretty impressive to know bomba on the many this 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.129
 year the g8 stand out from its lithium-ion 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.629
 % the proponent of the device I think rather that it's michel guyot 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.909
 small inconvenience 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.080
 at the beginning you really have to wait for them to unload for the 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.979
 recharge 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.120
 and then we realize that the most 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.919
 Huron unloading the load 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.009
 we can not furniture 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.800
 and longer autonomy 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.979
 to know that with a small daranca easily hold a day or two 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.669
 I speak 7 to the week that the sort to these nine 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.580
 so it would take a little bit to start it up to be able to 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.770
 functions 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.229
 orco torture of the device had not been translated into French by the 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.789
 Chinese so the translation fell 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.729
 more random apparently at the level of the main functions it's going 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.710
 but is it 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.750
 we can not actually phone and in French because as soon as we try 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.960
 to call a small step in French phone plan we elect a loan of 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.009
 translation 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.460
 so it's good I'm fast on the pcj not found 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.349
 besides the French CEO but I think I see 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.610
 a command that is poorly written because one can realize I know more 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.999
 where 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.999
 that some party lines overflowing 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.550
 and that's pretty embarrassing 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.029
 it smells in life it's just the code without doing 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.029
 but I did not sleep much 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.619
 call buttons to hang 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.619
 access the menu 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.810
 so chronic audio and video it's a little different from his counterpart 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.479
 change the amp situation 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.029
 especially for videos 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.069
 return 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.839
 direct access to the menu 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.949
 for a very good device ossonce small defects he spent a little bit of 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:50.569
 time 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.029
 I compare you 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.360
 and then that's all 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.379
 but hey it's a phone pda 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.379
 following my little problem is that everything works fine in English 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.469
 mother of a little worry in French at 3 5% I have hook law but 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.689
 apparently they have not got too much solution right now 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.679
 during your good side to know this phone is for sale on ideye it 

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:13.889
 is in very good condition except for fingerprints 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.889
 it worked very well so you can find the address 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.770
 Siberian ads on the internet and worse if you have questions 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.380
 do not hesitate 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.820
 it's a good day and see you soon on the podium
