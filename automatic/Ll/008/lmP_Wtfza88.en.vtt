00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 10 MYSTERIES THAT ARE NOT SOLVED ON THE PLACE 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 10. Why do we have a PRIVATE APP? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Why do we sometimes feel that something happened 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 It's hard to learn because of passing and not anticipating the kinds of feelings 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 9. Why do brain cells die in Alzheimer's disease? 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 A protein called Tau is considered to be responsible for the death of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 We don't know exactly how it attacks the brain. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 8. Why does music cause emotions? 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Music is not conducive to survival but causes emotions and physical reactions 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 The theory for this also includes music that expresses human voices and body movements 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 7. What is understanding? 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Brain processing information so we can explore the world around 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 However, this does not explain why we are subjective to the experience 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 6. How can special areas in the brain be united with other areas? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Part of the brain has areas dedicated to concentration 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 There is still a doubt about how the brain binds cracks to provide a unique understanding of the world 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 5. Why do we dream? 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Some scientists believe that dreaming helps us solve the problems encountered during the day 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Other scientists guess that dreams help the brain train 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 4. How does our brain understand time? 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Sound is faster than vision, and our brain syncs both 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Understanding how we do it will help us fight the disorder like dyslexia. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 3. What is intelligence? 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Rather, how does the brain's neuron solve the problem? 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Holding and using knowledge is a mystery, and why some people are smarter than the rest. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 2. How can we anticipate the future when planning? 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 The technology we use to teach the brain focuses on the present 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 How can we make a second prediction in a future event? 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 1. How do we store and collect memories? 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 The brain changes its appearance whenever we learn something new 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There is no explanation for how we reclaim memory
