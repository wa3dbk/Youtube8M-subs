splendidly<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.619> wave<00:01:25.799> defense<00:01:26.130> just

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
splendidly with wave defense just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
splendidly with wave defense just
because<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:26.759> maps<00:01:27.030> were<00:01:27.210> always<00:01:27.479> designed

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
because these maps were always designed

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
because these maps were always designed
with<00:01:27.990> massive<00:01:28.439> amounts<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.740> AI<00:01:29.070> combat<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
with massive amounts of AI combat in

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
with massive amounts of AI combat in
mine<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.600> titan<00:01:30.900> falls<00:01:31.020> multi-player

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
mine because titan falls multi-player

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
mine because titan falls multi-player
has<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> lot<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> AI<00:01:32.460> involvement<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> begin

has a lot of AI involvement to begin
with<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.650> maps<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
with and because of that these maps I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.649 
with and because of that these maps I
think<00:01:35.340> mesh<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.850> wave<00:01:36.060> defense<00:01:36.420> game

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
think mesh with the wave defense game

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
think mesh with the wave defense game
mode<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.259> effectively<00:01:37.740> than<00:01:38.040> say<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
mode much more effectively than say you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640

Stonehaven<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.640> map<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.880> doesn't<00:01:42.420> really

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
Stonehaven the map just doesn't really

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
Stonehaven the map just doesn't really
complement<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> experience<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.009> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
complement the experience because it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
complement the experience because it's
not<00:01:44.460> designed<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.180> experience<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
not designed with that experience in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
not designed with that experience in
mind<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.439> trying<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> cook<00:01:46.860> pizza<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
mind it's like trying to cook pizza in a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.460 
mind it's like trying to cook pizza in a
pot<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.119> possible<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.110> won't<00:01:49.290> fit

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pot it's possible but it won't fit

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
pot it's possible but it won't fit
properly<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.189> thus<00:01:50.310> won't<00:01:50.490> provide<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
properly and thus won't provide the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.149 
properly and thus won't provide the
optimal<00:01:51.540> qualitative<00:01:52.140> experience<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
optimal qualitative experience and so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
optimal qualitative experience and so
what<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.369> saying<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.790> titanfall<00:01:54.600> wave

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
what I'm saying is titanfall wave

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
what I'm saying is titanfall wave
defense<00:01:55.259> doesn't<00:01:55.530> suffer<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.070> same<00:01:56.340> head<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
defense doesn't suffer that same head to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
defense doesn't suffer that same head to
quality<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.329> pizza<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.229> always<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> part

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
quality because pizza was always a part

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
quality because pizza was always a part
of<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> equation<00:01:59.219> ultimately<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.719> what

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of the equation ultimately I think what

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.929 
of the equation ultimately I think what
makes<00:02:01.049> frontier<00:02:01.740> defense<00:02:02.100> fund<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> basically

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
makes frontier defense fund is basically

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.130 
makes frontier defense fund is basically
the<00:02:03.030> same<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.600> makes<00:02:03.780> titanfall

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the same thing that makes titanfall

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
the same thing that makes titanfall
multi-player<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.100> fun<00:02:05.340> they're<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:05.880> good

multi-player so fun they're really good

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
multi-player so fun they're really good

are bum rushing it now the problem with
titan<00:02:24.810> falls<00:02:24.990> MP<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.920> got<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
titan falls MP was that it got kind of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.770 
titan falls MP was that it got kind of
dull<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:27.180> wasn't<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.630> of

dull just because there wasn't a lot of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
dull just because there wasn't a lot of
depth<00:02:27.990> or<00:02:28.200> diversity<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:28.980> map<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.280> map<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
depth or diversity for map to map and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.920 
depth or diversity for map to map and
I've<00:02:29.730> taken<00:02:29.910> an<00:02:30.150> in-depth<00:02:30.510> look<00:02:30.600> at<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
I've taken an in-depth look at the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.780 
I've taken an in-depth look at the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
problems with MP and past videos but

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.760 
problems with MP and past videos but
they<00:02:32.940> don't<00:02:33.180> suffer<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> same

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
they don't suffer I think from the same

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.380 
they don't suffer I think from the same
problem<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.370> new<00:02:35.610> wave<00:02:35.820> defense<00:02:36.150> mode

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
problem in this new wave defense mode

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.580 
problem in this new wave defense mode
because<00:02:36.630> they've<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:36.900> put<00:02:37.260> some<00:02:37.440> work

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
because they've really put some work

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.320 
because they've really put some work
into<00:02:37.800> making<00:02:37.980> sure<00:02:38.340> each<00:02:38.550> map<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:38.970> its<00:02:39.150> own

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
into making sure each map has its own

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
into making sure each map has its own
unique<00:02:39.569> set<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.959> waves<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.530> types<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.920> enemies

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
unique set of waves and types of enemies

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.830 
unique set of waves and types of enemies
like<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.670> first<00:02:41.880> time<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> played<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:42.540> six

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
like the first time I played it with six

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.600 
like the first time I played it with six
waves<00:02:43.110> each<00:02:43.440> one<00:02:43.739> getting<00:02:44.010> gradually<00:02:44.220> more

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
waves each one getting gradually more

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.220 
waves each one getting gradually more
difficult<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.270> grand<00:02:45.480> finale<00:02:45.660> being<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
difficult with the grand finale being a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.199 
difficult with the grand finale being a
combination<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> huge<00:02:47.459> bum<00:02:47.760> rush<00:02:48.030> by

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.630 
trolled right now or what but then the
second<00:03:18.959> wave<00:03:19.079> was<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.590> massive<00:03:20.040> Armada

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
second wave was just this massive Armada

second wave was just this massive Armada
of<00:03:20.880> enemies<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.510> was<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:21.989> six<00:03:22.680> waves

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
of enemies it was like all six waves

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.740 
of enemies it was like all six waves
worth<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.549> enemies<00:03:23.910> combined<00:03:24.360> from<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
worth of enemies combined from the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.479 
worth of enemies combined from the
previous<00:03:25.140> match<00:03:25.350> all<00:03:25.590> at<00:03:25.860> once<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.340> was<00:03:26.459> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
previous match all at once it was a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.759 
previous match all at once it was a
clusterfuck<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.750> round<00:03:28.049> lasted

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
clusterfuck and that round lasted

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.979 
clusterfuck and that round lasted
probably<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.310> long<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:29.850> longer<00:03:29.970> than<00:03:30.750> all

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
probably as long if not longer than all

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.870 
probably as long if not longer than all
six<00:03:31.380> rounds<00:03:31.799> from<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.100> match<00:03:32.250> before<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.790> was

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
six rounds from the match before it was

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000 
six rounds from the match before it was
a<00:03:32.940> unique<00:03:33.180> experience<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.350> continued

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
a unique experience and that continued

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.190 
a unique experience and that continued
throughout<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.400> night<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.000> each<00:03:36.269> map<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.840> felt

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
throughout the night on each map it felt

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.870 
throughout the night on each map it felt
like<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> genuinely<00:03:37.860> different<00:03:38.340> experience

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
like a genuinely different experience

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.190 
like a genuinely different experience
and<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.090> get<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> new<00:03:39.420> map<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.780> I'd<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:39.959> oh
