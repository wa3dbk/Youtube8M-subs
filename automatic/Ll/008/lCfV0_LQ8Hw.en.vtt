 Your thoughts are also cordial 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 Welcome to the comments because that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 I find it particularly interesting 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.690
 Now I have five more questions for you 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.489
 But these questions will not be in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 comments answered but I have 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 what is the first link prepared in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 video description leads to a kind 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 survey 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.159
 and then I can evaluate that later 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.369
 and on Wednesday, I can then you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.509
 present what do you have 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.759
 decided 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.650
 we have decided most people 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.200
 what would you do if your friend 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.150
 was bitten 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 Will you leave him behind? 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.659
 continue to run around with it until it turns 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 transforms or becomes im directly 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.439
 Shovel over room 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.170
 Question number two is now an open one 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.640
 ask what would you use as a weapon 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.409
 you are traveling with a group of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.970
 friends suddenly you see another 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.590
 Group you could on the fast 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.150
 do not realize how many there were 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
 apparently they did not notice you 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.689
 what would you do you would try 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.399
 to contact the groups 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.680
 to join together or are you rather 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.229
 Carefully there is no risk and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 hidden or crumbled by you 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.329
 try your parents at work 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.350
 but reach the communication network 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.330
 collapsed 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.070
 what would you do you would not do 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.049
 on the way or at home 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.630
 wait until they come back like that and that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 last question you are traveling alone 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.930
 Two days went by until hungry 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.640
 Eaten find it a tin can 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 should the lid is arched that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.690
 minimum durability date is already one 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.739
 few months overdue you would the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.959
 content eat yes or no 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.510
 So that 's it for this episode left 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.060
 glad if you spread my videos 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 otherwise could be a small one 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.670
