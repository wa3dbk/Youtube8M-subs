00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
time to do than regular twists

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.339 
time to do than regular twists
I<00:04:06.440> think<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:07.040> did<00:04:07.610> my<00:04:07.760> whole<00:04:07.940> head<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.360> about<00:04:08.569> 2

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
I think I did my whole head in about 2

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.300 
I think I did my whole head in about 2
or<00:04:09.380> 3<00:04:09.680> hours<00:04:10.750> not<00:04:11.750> completely<00:04:12.230> sure

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
or 3 hours not completely sure

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.379 
or 3 hours not completely sure
definitely<00:04:13.310> took<00:04:13.430> me<00:04:13.549> less<00:04:13.700> time<00:04:13.970> than<00:04:14.150> with

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
definitely took me less time than with

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.270 
definitely took me less time than with
regular<00:04:14.569> twists<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:18.320> also<00:04:18.440> doesn't<00:04:18.709> shrink<00:04:19.039> as

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
regular twists it also doesn't shrink as

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.180
