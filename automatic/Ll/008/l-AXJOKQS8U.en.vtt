00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:08.320
 I tell you that this tiny pepper is 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.290
 very powerful for me is what was left of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.589
 a little plant that I did not Prospero 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.019
 now became a souvenir because I 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.560
 bring the memory of that trip I made 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:23.289
 to sicilia the remote dream island to which 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.439
 I want to return my idea to rent a 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.539
 cottage on top of a gentle hill and 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.439
 sit at sunset at the time of 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.740
 tramonto where the sun goes slow slow and 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.950
 I would have hung on a hook several 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.080
 views of peppers like this so that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:48.170
 the light passes through the braids 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:51.050
 red and reflect your shadow on the wall 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.719
 and then when the night came it would start 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.329
 some to fry it with an oil of 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.870
 olive and giant olives and basil and 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.610
 sliced ​​aubergines that I would buy in the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.770
 market of palermo 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.740
 and maybe the next day in the morning 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.950
 I would take the car to get to the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.410
 theater dug in the stone that is in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.590
 another lonely hill in a place that 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.950
 flame sei is and snack and down the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.460
 only olive tree that on the side of the sand 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.979
 of the stage seems to be the only 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 backstage and another day I would go to taormina 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.320
 to sit on the terrace of a cafe 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.780
 of the course humberto in a cafe that has 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 a piano next to the fence that gives the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 Cliff 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.510
 the piano they say toco truman capote and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 with a coffee ristretto I will see through 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.170
 the mist the blue sea and far away the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.120
 volcano and two will surely approach me 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 amateur musicians with their mandolins 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.720
 out of tune to give me a melody 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.280
 typical Sicilian 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.759
 all the dream springs from the pepper 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.430
 tiny and I know that as long as he lasts 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.829
 illusion will resist 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.030
 and if I can not go I will say as in the 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.010
 stories the famous Italian saying yes non 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.000
