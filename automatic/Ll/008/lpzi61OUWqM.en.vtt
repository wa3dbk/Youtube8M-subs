00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.820
 evening we will now talk about a time 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.860
 that the under 50s can not 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.420
 to know it was the time when in France 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.250
 there were only four or five radios 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.359
 it was thirty years ago anyway it 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.760
 exactly 30 years ago on November 9, 1981 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.150
 the waves of the fm band was released 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.800

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.070
 of what were called radios 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.599
 free 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.700
 one of the very first ones that had 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.570
 a lot marked the time it was carbon 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.719
 14 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.059

 animators was called david big cock 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.160
 super chicks father luche bonux and of course 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.489

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.890
 lafesse 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.120
 good evening it was thirty years ago 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.120
 remember your credits 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.790
 already 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.790
 his shoulder you 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.740
 so on carbon 14 has for those who do not 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.940
 do not remember or who do not have 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 heard or who are too young we are going 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.320
 listen to an excerpt from a show there on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.050
 understands that one of your guests a little 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.970
 too drunk and obviously it was not the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.220
 only to booze a bit in the studio listen 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.920
 no she did not have to see so how 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.409
 she is red and came back all this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.409
 buzz people she's not the only one 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:49.520
 so we're going to live you that he wants 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 not the stack the sale tied to the VAT 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 it looks like an old woman looks like a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 blank sill figures not return this 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.750
 case the story is old it's very 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.820
 old and especially I see all 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.530
 regrets because we could have done 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 something extraordinary the time 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 with his radios there and 1 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.319
 unfortunately with carbon 14 with 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.310
 all the free radios everything is 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.660
 in all 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.150
 all free radios tulloch scene 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.599
 adventure failed yes completely yes that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.380
 walked anyway and then after 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.300
 two years to stop 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.220
 yes because it had become this being 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.750
 good the reality today is with the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.790
 hindsight we can lend him top of the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.150
 tons of good intention but in the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.200
 reality 90% of what we listened to 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.360
 was done in this tea radio when 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.930
 even enough schoolboy see fucked like we 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.150
 have just heard 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.069
 yeah yeah that's the problem and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 it's nice to hold the Arabic language 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.310
 no we can we can we can brandish 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.599
 the standard of liberty etc the problem 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.680
 is that in addition to 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.080
 responsible for this radio 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.140
 it was even more unmanageable than 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 his hosts was that he attributes the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.210
 zoo we will say which we did not very well 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.920
 knew 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.480
 what were the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.800
 foundations there were weapons that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.020
 trailed in there even though it was 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.210
 not war I would like weapons to 40 14 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.090
 yes what kind of arms girl to pump what 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.960
 they were thugs 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 they were thugs of the militants 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.100
 policies not the revolution not the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.650
 all of the mutants political name of the people 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.330
 who will write parallel trades 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.910
 what but we discovered it in the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.920
 out on the air that your bosses that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.480
 the founders of the radio this was 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.610
 not very clean there yeah we have everything 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.810
 narrated yes they arrived as shad 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.670
 flap yes no but it was an adventure 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.460
 epic that's why at the limit 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.530
 it's an exercise to why these thugs 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.570
 in quotation marks I had to have fun 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.580
 no there were shelters the man it was 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.210
 a dancer it was a man and stop 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.580
 of jcs a care to finance things 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.390
 who amuses us in the concert of 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.920
 free radios 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.870
 why not after all since after 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.100
 it was all from the beginning so that for 8 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.700
 the beginning of an adventure 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.230
 financial 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.390
 especially when the time his shoulders and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.800
 by political party because there was 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.960
 a political party behind at the start 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.820
 that was who but we learn from 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.200
 things go to tell no it was there 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.660
 thirty years ago prescription is going to te 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.060
 know what is the political party that 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.480
 had financed carbon 14 the entire radio 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.700
 freedom 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.620
 he had the information and isabelle 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.510
 they were Iranian on the news to 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.510
 the time is what is happening political 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.190
 it was called how to tell him the rpr 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.820
 jean pierre the rpa so that was the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.700
 Gaullist 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.980
 it was the goal the old yves the old 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.540
 had gotten in touch with someone but 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.790
 that was like it's still a 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.810
 companion of liberation and had 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.250
 found hamon to him to go made 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.720
 trust a guy so I do it 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.220
 all the landmarks and the Gaullists was 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.220
 behind the creation of this radio is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.050
 at the very beginning but realistic yeah but 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.250
 without knowing what was going on there 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.960
 so he came several times 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.220
 when he discovered what was happening 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.240
 outside the information the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.880
 Valencians arrived at several 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.860
 times we ask that it stops 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.900
 the vidame again because that for all 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.790
 reflected by turn there was a 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.960
 serious who offered himself anyway so has 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.280
 their idea was to make a radio 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.810
 rather right 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.490
 and then are found with crazy people 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.990
 furious who made it a crazy duo 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.360
 at first this was the idea and then when 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.950
 when the boss of this radio took 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.230
 aware that in fact this radio 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.140
 walked with all these crazy on the air 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.590
 he made his choice as we say it's 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.480
 the past 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.310
 for me it's the past now 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.670
 which interests me is the present 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.670
 always
