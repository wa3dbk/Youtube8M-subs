00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello today to my goethes 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.259
 11 video I have something for you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 nice prepared and that i have in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.219
 last time and again 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 American and English side 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.580
 This beautiful idea here discovers its 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.070
 beautify your headphones and that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 that exists from these old hangers 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.869
 pearls like everyone probably at home 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 I had it in those colors now 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.330
 here or in this further 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 not dull colors but world 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 darker colors I say now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.079
 normal and were women 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.730
 red blue and so keeps but I found this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.110
 and color personally just a lot 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 nicer and that has turned out here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.770
 are my headphones and have it all 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 i made i will show you right away 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.610
 how it worked and yes me 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.199
 just thought this time I will 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 just translate into German and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 your time because I think right now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 goes to school and it's still a bit 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.430
 true, what is that a real one? 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.500
 Looked for this studio's bookstore needs 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.490
 you three things and that is it once 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.290
 In general, the shackles still pearl that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.720
 What really very sharp knife 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 should be and should be pointed that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 is particularly important that is the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 tip in itself should be particularly sharp 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 and best you should be as 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 take pad simple wooden board 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 so you do not hurt yourself with it 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.390
 the hangers get beads on the cable 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.070
 you should make a small slit 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.290
 cut from left to right 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.450
 and many if now think that one 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.790
 Just cut so clean that one 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.979
 to say with the two fingers so that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 a christ and then so right under 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.880
 cuts but that would be really great 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.470
 it should be dangerous too 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.320
 leave because otherwise you still yours at the end 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 finger broke cuts so you 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 just hurt for this reason 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.920
 I'll take you there and then you should just 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.719
 from above down schneider and my tip 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.909
 nail polish went with me flutes 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.450
 the last two days so easy 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.700
 do not use a new nail polish 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.739
 and yes just cut down from above 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.090
 We now see I have my fingers 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890
 Marco purpose for it to do something 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.110
 more clear 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.569
 and that may be a bit in the beginning 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.770
 take a bit of practice 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.930
 but in the end it will all be 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.670
 bit faster and now 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.950
 hopefully easy to recognize that there 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 already a slit in it 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.360
 but now I have the pink again 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.060
 And that's exactly what it is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.070
 same down from above and that makes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 you then with a kernel depending on how 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.880
 many colors you want to use 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 have now used all the colors and have 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.680
 then a sequence is considered and 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 have these one after the other to the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.739
 Cable clamped on 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.540
 my tip for you if you like this 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.239
 to make everything a little easier 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.620
 you should look for a tool 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.920
 and as you see when I do that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 knife race track goes deep the gap 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.989
 on and exactly the same needed now 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.830
 I have such a clothespin on 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.720
 my grandpa has taken then 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.760
 broken apart and with such a 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.350
 tip wood thing something like so 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.120
 a cone on you can go there 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.280
 put it in and if you put it in 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.140
 can now recognize the same 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.519
 the plan so to speak, I have it 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.260
 at the beginning still only with the finger 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.950
 and I'll tell you that it's one 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
 Brussels work 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.480
 if such a tool you can do it 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.870
 really much faster i'm straight 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 on two requests cable down here and there 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.209
 should you really just that 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.070
 then split the finger and think 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.750
 sorry for all my 33 and whatever 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.850
 and press that in and then you can 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.160
 pull out that wooden stick and if you 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.870
 because pulled out you see that the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.090
 planner is tuned and then just 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.250
 to press briefly and to the desired 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.500
 push and then that would have to 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.360
 the whole thing looks exactly the same 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.040
 just do it with the colors and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.250
 I would recommend you 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 first to start with the entries above 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.829
 So they are the old ones 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.380
 actual headphones lead to it 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.700
 It's just easier because you are now 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.310
 Also, you will see that around 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.650
 just a bit more relaxed and 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.570
 It 's all a bit tighter down there 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.060
 and hard to do so if you are 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.530
 have a bit of exercise go down 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 and in the beginning really only with the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 start another 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.720
 when you 're done , you see 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.860
 whole and I hope that totally 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.000
 that has fallen so far but that 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.060
 Wm game at the end probably 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.960
 say it again anyway 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.950
 and now I will be especially 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.520
 Are you interested in that? 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.270
 have already tried at home and 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.130
 Just describe it to the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.650
 comment box hope the total has you 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.870
 liked and what I super in retrospect 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.670
 practically find all the idea is that you 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.400
 just keep putting it in your backpack 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.990
 and just prevent it 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.520
 will that come in somehow kloten 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.100
 By that, of course, that is now, of course 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.470
 little state is through the plastic and 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.930
 yes, I always practically the problem 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.480
 had that my mp3 player always 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.190
 completely knotted with my whole 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.220
 cable and the problem I have now 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.020
 can of course simultaneously dissolved 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.600
 We like to write in the comments 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.040
 you like the thing yourself or if it is 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.590
 Maybe you a little bit too 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.090
 is colorful and of course can give me love 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.460
 a thumbs up if it is you 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.200
 Do not forget and subscribe 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.940
 if you are not from 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.840
 and yes, until the next video and it 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.840
 then it was called
