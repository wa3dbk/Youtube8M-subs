show you how to build the automated
farming<00:00:06.270> machine<00:00:06.629> which<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.170> right<00:00:07.410> here

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
farming machine which is this right here

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.860 
farming machine which is this right here
it<00:00:08.370> works<00:00:08.610> using<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.120> new<00:00:09.240> features<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.690> are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
it works using the new features that are

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.959 
it works using the new features that are
going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.139> added<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.620> Minecraft<00:00:11.099> 1.5<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
going to be added in Minecraft 1.5 and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
going to be added in Minecraft 1.5 and
they<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.780> comp<00:00:13.019> rate<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
they are the comp rate is and the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.860 
they are the comp rate is and the
dispensers<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.599> facing

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
dispensers that we have here facing

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.140 
dispensers that we have here facing
downwards<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> these<00:00:17.520> are<00:00:17.699> full<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> bone

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
downwards and these are full of bone

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
downwards and these are full of bone
meal<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:18.570> bone<00:00:18.900> mill<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.260> now<00:00:19.470> grow

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
meal because bone mill can now grow

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.290 
meal because bone mill can now grow
crops<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.840> 1.5<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.109> let<00:00:22.230> me<00:00:22.350> show<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.590> that

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
crops in 1.5 so let me show you that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.019 
crops in 1.5 so let me show you that
there<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> go<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.130> works<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.880> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
there you go so this works with as you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.679 
there you go so this works with as you
saw<00:00:27.269> wheat<00:00:28.140> carrots<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.130> potatoes<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
saw wheat carrots and potatoes and so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
saw wheat carrots and potatoes and so
the<00:00:30.810> way<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.140> works<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.769> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the way that this works is we have this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
the way that this works is we have this
pressure<00:00:32.250> plate<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.940> either<00:00:33.149> end<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.690> they

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
pressure plate at either end and they

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
pressure plate at either end and they
are<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> ship<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> floors<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
are going to ship the floors that the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
are going to ship the floors that the
crops<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.390> cause<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
crops are on which will cause them to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.709 
crops are on which will cause them to
harvest<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> dispensers<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.629> at

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
harvest so when the dispensers are on at

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
harvest so when the dispensers are on at
the<00:00:39.809> top<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.350> walk<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.920> side<00:00:41.190> like

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the top we can walk down one side like

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
the top we can walk down one side like
this<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.420> dispensers<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.110> grow<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
this and the dispensers will grow the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
this and the dispensers will grow the
crops<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> end<00:00:44.760> we're

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
crops and when we get to the end we're

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
crops and when we get to the end we're
going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> ship<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> floor<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.770> one

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
going to ship the floor of the one

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
going to ship the floor of the one
behind<00:00:47.370> us<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> gives<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> chance<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:49.020> all

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
behind us so it gives it a chance of all

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
behind us so it gives it a chance of all
of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> crops<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.710> grow<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> side<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
of the crops to grow on this side then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
of the crops to grow on this side then
we<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.750> go<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> side<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we can go down this side and all of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
we can go down this side and all of
these<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.520> grown<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
these have now grown when we get to the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
these have now grown when we get to the
end<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> ship<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> floor<00:00:55.590> turn<00:00:56.190> around

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
end of in a ship the floor turn around

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
end of in a ship the floor turn around
and<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> side<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.440> let<00:00:58.559> me<00:00:58.649> give<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.010> an

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and use that side so let me give you an

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
and use that side so let me give you an
example<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.449> action<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.199> down<00:01:01.530> like

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
example of this in action and down like

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
example of this in action and down like
this<00:01:01.770> holding<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.670> click<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> turn

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this holding down right click to turn

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420 
this holding down right click to turn
around<00:01:03.470> place<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> other<00:01:05.280> side

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
around place them down on the other side

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
around place them down on the other side
and<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> end<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.630> we're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and want to get to the end here we're

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.010 
and want to get to the end here we're
going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> harvest<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> ones<00:01:07.680> behind<00:01:08.010> us<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
going to harvest the ones behind us and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.390 
going to harvest the ones behind us and
the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.229> thing<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the same thing when we get back down to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.399 
the same thing when we get back down to
this<00:01:11.670> end<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:12.869> noisy<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this end and it is a little bit noisy to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
this end and it is a little bit noisy to
use<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> hear<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> dispensers<00:01:15.000> are

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
use as you can hear the dispensers are

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
use as you can hear the dispensers are
always<00:01:15.360> firing<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:17.009> thing<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> note<00:01:17.580> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
always firing and one thing to note is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
always firing and one thing to note is
that<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.570> fully<00:01:18.780> grown<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that when these are fully grown the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
that when these are fully grown the
dispensers<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> keep<00:01:20.580> using

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
dispensers are not going to keep using

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
dispensers are not going to keep using
the<00:01:20.939> bonemeal<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> efficient<00:01:22.500> it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the bonemeal so this is efficient it's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.730 
the bonemeal so this is efficient it's
not<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> waste<00:01:23.159> any<00:01:23.580> resources<00:01:24.740> I've

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
not going to waste any resources I've

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
not going to waste any resources I've
also<00:01:25.920> built<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> alternative<00:01:27.119> design<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
also built this alternative design to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
also built this alternative design to
show<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> while<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> concrete

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
show you that you can while the concrete

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
show you that you can while the concrete
is<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.729> behind<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.409> can

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
is from behind like this and you can

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
is from behind like this and you can
still<00:01:31.860> power<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> dispensers<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> same

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
still power the dispensers in the same

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
still power the dispensers in the same
way<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.810> run<00:01:33.960> run<00:01:34.229> any<00:01:34.650> slower<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.579> then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
way they run run any slower and then

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
way they run run any slower and then
this<00:01:35.820> frees<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> top<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> dispensers

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this frees up the top of the dispensers

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
this frees up the top of the dispensers
just<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> case<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> wanted<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> add<00:01:38.460> some

are<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.870> same<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.440> side<00:02:24.500> they've<00:02:24.890> just

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
are the same on this side they've just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.100 
are the same on this side they've just
been<00:02:25.220> rotated<00:02:25.820> around<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.660> copy<00:02:26.870> what

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
been rotated around so you can copy what

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.170 
been rotated around so you can copy what
you're<00:02:27.260> building<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:28.430> side<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.970> build

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
you're building on this side and build

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.120 
you're building on this side and build
it<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:30.020> one<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.560> we're<00:02:30.830> left<00:02:30.950> with

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
it on that one and then we're left with

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.760 
it on that one and then we're left with
eight<00:02:31.340> blocks<00:02:31.640> across<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.360> middle<00:02:32.690> each<00:02:33.290> each

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
eight blocks across the middle each each

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.430 
eight blocks across the middle each each
segment<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.580> one<00:02:34.850> wide<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.480> identical<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
segment that is one wide is identical so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.780 
segment that is one wide is identical so
when<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.680> build<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.160> those<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.460> copy

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
when you build one of those you can copy

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.460 
when you build one of those you can copy
it<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.360> way<00:02:38.390> across<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.290> can

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
it going all the way across you can

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.960 
it going all the way across you can
actually<00:02:39.590> make<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.100> machine<00:02:40.340> bigger<00:02:40.760> you

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
actually make this machine bigger you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970 
actually make this machine bigger you
can<00:02:41.090> make<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.480> middle<00:02:41.750> section<00:02:41.960> nine<00:02:42.410> wide<00:02:42.710> or

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
can make the middle section nine wide or

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.040 
can make the middle section nine wide or
if<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.190> wanted<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.520> save<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.850> resources<00:02:44.300> you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
if you wanted to save on resources you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.870 
if you wanted to save on resources you
can<00:02:45.200> make<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.530> smaller<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.460> build<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
can make it smaller so to build the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
can make it smaller so to build the
first<00:02:47.090> light<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.630> need<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.080> place<00:02:48.290> down

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
first light you just need to place down

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
first light you just need to place down
these<00:02:49.160> blocks<00:02:49.490> like<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:50.510> corner

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
these blocks like this in this corner

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.170 
these blocks like this in this corner
and<00:02:51.170> then<00:02:51.650> do<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> exact<00:02:52.250> same<00:02:52.280> thing<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and then do the exact same thing in the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.660 
and then do the exact same thing in the
other<00:02:53.330> corner<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.950> second<00:02:55.340> layer<00:02:55.490> we're

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.210 
then you want to place these blocks
which<00:03:06.050> wrap<00:03:06.320> around<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.800> ones<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.130> we've

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
which wrap around the ones that we've

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.040 
which wrap around the ones that we've
placed<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> previous<00:03:08.209> layer<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.660> then

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
placed in the previous layer and then

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.210 
placed in the previous layer and then
you're<00:03:09.200> putting<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.470> torch<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.010> side<00:03:10.190> of

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
you're putting a torch on the side of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.220 
you're putting a torch on the side of
that<00:03:10.490> block<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.390> torch<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.990> side<00:03:12.200> of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that block and a torch on the side of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.380 
that block and a torch on the side of
this<00:03:12.500> one<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.670> same<00:03:13.910> down<00:03:14.180> this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
this one and that is the same down this

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.660 
this one and that is the same down this
same<00:03:14.600> here<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.140> well<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> middle

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
same here as well and then in the middle

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.180 
same here as well and then in the middle
we've<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.000> got<00:03:17.239> five<00:03:17.510> blocks<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.140> row<00:03:18.190> it's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
we've just got five blocks in a row it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.120 
we've just got five blocks in a row it's
the<00:03:19.280> same<00:03:19.519> going<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.060> way<00:03:20.090> across<00:03:21.130> for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
the same going all the way across for

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.380 
the same going all the way across for
the<00:03:22.220> third<00:03:22.430> layer<00:03:22.730> we're<00:03:22.910> going<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.090> start<00:03:23.330> off

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the third layer we're going to start off

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.390 
the third layer we're going to start off
by<00:03:23.420> placing<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.350> redstone<00:03:24.680> torch<00:03:25.040> here<00:03:25.100> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
by placing this redstone torch here a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.550 
by placing this redstone torch here a
comparator<00:03:25.970> facing<00:03:26.390> into<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.989> piston<00:03:27.440> which

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
comparator facing into this piston which

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.290 
comparator facing into this piston which
we're<00:03:27.739> going<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.890> place<00:03:28.100> down<00:03:28.370> with<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.000> block

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
we're going to place down with a block

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.090 
we're going to place down with a block
to<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> side<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.530> then<00:03:30.769> put<00:03:30.950> down

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
to the side of it and then put down

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.340 
to the side of it and then put down
these<00:03:31.280> two<00:03:31.550> redstone<00:03:31.790> wires<00:03:32.300> then<00:03:32.959> we'll<00:03:33.170> put

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
these two redstone wires then we'll put

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.650 
these two redstone wires then we'll put
a<00:03:33.380> block<00:03:33.650> here<00:03:33.680> another<00:03:34.280> piston<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.000> then<00:03:35.540> in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
a block here another piston and then in

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.060 
a block here another piston and then in
front<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.140> we've<00:03:36.350> got<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> block<00:03:36.769> of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
front of that we've got a block of

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.009 
front of that we've got a block of
farmland<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.850> stone<00:03:38.239> pressure<00:03:38.480> plate<00:03:38.810> and

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
farmland and stone pressure plate and

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.020 
farmland and stone pressure plate and
there<00:03:39.140> two<00:03:39.320> more<00:03:39.500> blocks<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.130> again<00:03:40.790> it's

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
there two more blocks and again it's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.270 
there two more blocks and again it's
just<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.360> same<00:03:41.600> thing<00:03:41.900> at<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.620> other<00:03:42.650> end<00:03:43.070> and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
just the same thing at the other end and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.430 
just the same thing at the other end and
then<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> middle<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:44.660> we<00:03:44.750> have<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.170> block

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
then in the middle what we have is block

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160 
then in the middle what we have is block
water<00:03:45.739> farmland<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.760> gap<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.269> then<00:03:47.510> farmland

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
water farmland a gap and then farmland

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.430 
water farmland a gap and then farmland
water<00:03:48.410> block<00:03:48.769> going<00:03:49.160> all<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.430> way<00:03:49.459> across<00:03:50.440> for

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
water block going all the way across for

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.900 
water block going all the way across for
the<00:03:51.470> fourth<00:03:51.769> layer<00:03:52.010> we<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:52.430> need<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.700> place

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
the fourth layer we just need to place

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.580 
the fourth layer we just need to place
some<00:03:53.120> blocks<00:03:53.239> above<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> water<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.470> we

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
some blocks above the water that we

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.620 
some blocks above the water that we
placed<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> previous<00:03:55.550> layer<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
placed in the previous layer and on the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.780 
placed in the previous layer and on the
edge<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:56.959> as<00:03:57.140> well<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:57.590> place<00:03:58.010> them<00:03:58.280> up

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
edge here as well so just place them up

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.820 
edge here as well so just place them up
and<00:03:59.120> over<00:03:59.269> one<00:03:59.630> block<00:03:59.780> in<00:04:00.410> front<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
and over one block in front of the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.030 
and over one block in front of the
farmland

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
farmland

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.339 
farmland
for<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:02.969> fifth<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.420> final<00:04:03.689> layer<00:04:04.049> we're

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
for the fifth and final layer we're

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.050 
for the fifth and final layer we're
going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> place<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.890> comparators<00:04:05.489> on<00:04:05.760> top<00:04:05.939> of

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
going to place the comparators on top of

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.550 
going to place the comparators on top of
the<00:04:06.120> blocks<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.599> placed<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.170> previous

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the blocks and placed in the previous

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.770 
the blocks and placed in the previous
layer<00:04:07.709> facing<00:04:08.189> towards<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.670> center<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.329> in

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
layer facing towards the center and in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.240 
layer facing towards the center and in
front<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.109> them<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:10.409> need<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.590> put<00:04:10.829> down<00:04:11.040> some

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
front of them we need to put down some

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.429 
front of them we need to put down some
dispensers<00:04:11.939> so<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.719> way<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.170> would<00:04:13.290> do

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
dispensers so the way that you would do

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.229 
dispensers so the way that you would do
this<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.859> place<00:04:14.099> blocks<00:04:14.430> above<00:04:14.819> where<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
this is place blocks above where the

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.270 
this is place blocks above where the
dispensers<00:04:15.810> are<00:04:15.989> at<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.199> moment<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.739> then

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
dispensers are at the moment and then

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.949 
dispensers are at the moment and then
you<00:04:17.430> would<00:04:17.549> stand<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.359> replace<00:04:18.690> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
you would stand here and you replace the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.379 
you would stand here and you replace the
dispenser<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.889> underside<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:21.030> block

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
dispenser on the underside of that block

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.300 
dispenser on the underside of that block
up<00:04:21.660> above<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.889> remove<00:04:23.130> those

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
up above then you can remove those

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.860 
up above then you can remove those
blocks<00:04:23.639> after<00:04:23.880> you've<00:04:24.120> placed<00:04:24.330> all<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.720> them

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
blocks after you've placed all of them

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.170 
blocks after you've placed all of them
put<00:04:25.139> down<00:04:25.169> redstone<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.039> top<00:04:26.070> like<00:04:26.610> this<00:04:26.669> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
put down redstone on top like this and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.689 
put down redstone on top like this and
then<00:04:27.810> put<00:04:28.050> two<00:04:28.259> levers<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.979> sides<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
then put two levers on the sides of the

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.430 
then put two levers on the sides of the
dispensers<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.539> then<00:04:30.780> your<00:04:30.930> machine<00:04:31.050> will

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
dispensers and then your machine will

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.350 
dispensers and then your machine will
just<00:04:31.650> need<00:04:31.800> bone<00:04:32.100> meal<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.729> dispensers

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
just need bone meal and the dispensers

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.529
