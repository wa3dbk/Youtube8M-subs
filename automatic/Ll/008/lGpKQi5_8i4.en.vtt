 welcome welcome to this resource 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.330
 audiovisual than the coastal technology 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 rich and the waste management program 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 institutions prepared for 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.210
 instruct him the contamination is understood 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 as a modification or alteration 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 Negative of the environment by agents 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 various as chemical substances 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.680
 physical or biological agents some 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
 solid waste have the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.359
 particularity that can be recovered 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 in order to decrease the impact 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.719
 environmental that produce the waste 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.809
 solids can be classified into 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.530
 ordinary and hazardous waste 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 dangerous include hospital 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.960
 radioactive electronic luminaires 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.109
 public lighting and fluorescent tubes 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 among others solid waste 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.170
 ordinary include waste not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.060
 recoverable and recoverable waste 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.399
 namely 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:20.310
 plastic paper and cardboard aluminum glass 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:26.159
 organic biodegradable scrap and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 others as debris and decanted the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 human being produces solid waste 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.149
 since its existence and the volume per 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.340
 capita constantly increases as 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.909
 consequence of the accelerated process of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.710
 urbanization industrial growth and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.220
 the modification of the patterns of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.220
 consumption 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.970
 currently the population density and the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.759
 per capita volume of waste 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.790
 solids are so high that it is required 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.220
 urgently take short measures 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.960
 medium and long term in order to 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.090
 decrease the impact of this 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.149
 problematic the tech gives its first 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.910
 steps in the 80s with the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.910
 collection and recovery of paper 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.540
 institutional waste and in the year 2000 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.069
 bad waste management is created 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.560
 institutions with the intention of 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.800
 give proper handling to waste 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.430
 ordinary institutional solids 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.360
 the main objective of madrid is 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.030
 sensitize the community 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.970
 institutional management and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.870
 Responsible disposal of waste 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.520
 ordinary solids in the tec through 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 del madrid have been implemented 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.840
 strategies four R's of managing 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.800
 waste to know reject reduce 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.210
 reuse and recycle the waste that 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.210
 are generated in the institution 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.090
 according to their order of importance and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.030
 environmental benefit that causes its 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.500
 application the four R's can be 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.920
 enlist to yes 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.840
 reject implies for example not buying 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
 those products that come with 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.250
 Excessive packaging material or in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 disposable container 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.140
 is to prevent the generation of waste 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.680
 reduce implies for example buy and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:32.800
 consume what is necessary is to minimize 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.230
 waste generation reuse is to give 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.480
 maximum use of certain products that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.670
 so allow it as for example the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.000
 garage sales and use of packaging 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.390
 returnable 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:54.780
 and recycling is to process a waste in a 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.780
 new product types of plastics 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.079
 certain types of plastics are 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.650
 used as fuel for 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.159
 produce cement other types are recycled 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.829
 to recycle plastic containers 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.870
 these must be rinsed 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.409
 drained and crushed and without any 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.889
 object inside the types of plastic that 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:24.490
 they do not recover are the exterior and the pvc 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.710
 types of glass bottles are recycled 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.349
 Glass bottles and containers 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.530
 any color these must be 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.870
 rinsed if drained without the lid and 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.229
 without any other material than the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.750
 paper label types of glass 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.660
 that are not recovered are ceramics 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.020
 porcelains and glass window 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.160
 laboratory glass bayrex mirrors 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.150
 thermometers among other types of 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.440
 paper is recycled white paper to color 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.880
 and newspaper the paper should come clean 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.640
 without wrinkling and without metal clips 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.360
 paper that does not recover includes the 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:16.510
 dirty paper or damp paper fax paper 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:19.990
 cellophane and hygienic types 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:24.550
 aluminum are recycled only 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:33.670
 cans of drinks these must be 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:36.040
 rinsed drained and crushed others 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.010
 types of recoverable waste are the 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.980
 scrap poly-laminated containers like 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.000
 the tetra pak the fax toner and 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.000
 ink cartridges 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.960
 The tec also has the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.030
 recovery of electronic waste to 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.710
 through the transfer center and 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.710
 transformation of materials 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.370
 there are multiple social actors like 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.810
 the municipalities institutions 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.520
 educational health entities sectors 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.980
 the agroindustrial and industrial 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.680
 associations of communal living forces 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.260
 those who should look for a joint 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.880
 among all to achieve an adequate 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.650
 solid waste management 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.930
 ordinary 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.060
 the term of the lifespan of the 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.020
 landfills nationwide 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.210
 is closer than expected 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.090
 On the other hand nobody wants a filling 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.479
 sanitary near your community so 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.270
 which all social actors must 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.030
 be aware that the final provision 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.060
 of waste in landfills or dumps 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.409
 should be seen as the last option to 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.289
 follow 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.659
 the municipalities invest a high 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.550
 percentage of your budget in the 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.889
 transfer and disposal of 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.279
 ordinary solid waste from their 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:04.879
 communities to landfills and landfills without 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:07.249
 However, 85% of the waste that 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:09.919
 we generate are recoverable 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:12.639
 that is, they should not be arranged in 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.639
 landfills 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.700
 mother nature is wise in the 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.400
 waste management because the 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.200
 take advantage as your food we should 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.390
 follow his example as far as 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.480
 possible in order to inherit future ones 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.480
 generations a better quality of life
