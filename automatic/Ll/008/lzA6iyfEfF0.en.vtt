 as a scientific still a defect in the suspension next to the main 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.290
 way to lend a the mayor 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.239
 the car does not 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.139
 not stable that pulls from one side to another yes 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.589
 knocking noises in the suspension the most frequent is a pedestrian of the 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.309
 pieces 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.110
 very damaged 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.980
 stefánsson art 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.300
 that kind of noise has some common denominator for example there is a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.669
 case a corsa evolution that has is a noise as if it escaped the air 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.669
 ap some piece of suspension almost kong 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.169
 Well, that's not because there is no formal presentation 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 except that the most loaded shock absorbers with gas 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.460
 but if they use the gas 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.560
 when I pass, I have the weight 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.590
 the vehicle of the person on this one 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.740
 was determined 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.340
 when a rollover happens 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 as a curve 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.740
 the rector peset coexist 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 every spring has a principle of action-reaction 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 If I put my car only springs 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.790
 now is that the car 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.760
 compress the spring for a post for which reason 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.890
 villepín long ceoe leche 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.230
 because then the spring reacts 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.170
 this the second a jumping paper 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.840
 that make cushion 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 frenadeso 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.400
 cushioning is a brake on the resort 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.340
 it is has 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.050
 inside has oil the special appointment 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.820
 some have a gas that helped stabilize the oil 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600
 but they are not reason for the 2000 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.940
 all metabolic 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.930
 that never entered that there is no city bubble 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.150
 I always made them working on a corked stuck valve 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 the spring the cushion proves it p 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 it's softer when 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.270
 and when it's made with car panels that have a red sole 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.490
 it's softer for leo travel running fins running 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.850
 spring wants to go back 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.960
 well clear that in what it includes then in the stability because if the car 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.740
 I can not handle now 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.780
 they include the softness being cushioning is very hard 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.790
 it was not that it's spring functions and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.850
 chelo cushion the very soft posts 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.410
 cars that advertising 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.629
 then it is a piece that plays a very important role 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.820
 but your goal 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.849
 is to stop the oscillations of profit 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.329
 which were then progressive 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.469
 here I have it at hand 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.929
 that if you that this spring is not equal 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.549
 here is thinner 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.439
 girl like fattening yes 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.240
 this is what happens with the progressive spring 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.529
 even when you go 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.759
 and with them the fifth potholes of the street all that yes 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.019
 that spring 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.259
 the first part sexual celistics 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.000
 the spring is adding up to stretch 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.289
 as it gets understood, it gets 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.669
 then the first part is softer to explain it 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.969
 montilla so much yan triacastela sense cargo little by little of the fast promo 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:46.829
 well 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.129
 while stretching next was changing 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.059
 the hardness of reaction of the two 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.699
 Celtic that is the graphic part that the spring is not symmetrical 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.179
 that if it is true that yes 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:01.889
 if a shock strikes, it is necessary to change the next one to return the 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.809
 another for that 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.599
 let's put in pairs francis españa 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.439
 by a sighted blow 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.560
 and the other and they were good adjustments 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.859
 You can change one 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.859
 because it was a failure 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.789
 a bad moment 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:16.819
 monsoon body 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.019
 a pothole that had 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.699
 follow 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.009
 in that case you can change one by one recommended by raising one 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.359
 harder than the other yes 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.859
 the usual with a portugal españa or is that the other one on the other side has also 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:28.199
 fact 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.189
 there were jobs and 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.049
 and is more or less close to the same thing happening 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.429
 and they have presented themselves in pairs to maintain unemployment 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:36.610
 symmetric and state 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.309
 why 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:41.689
 some directions attended another element that is part of the 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.689
 system are heavier less expensive than in other 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.549
 with springs of the ascent is to defend 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 it's name was unique that they help pc effort with him 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.089
 there are some that have 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.169
 capacity 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.109
 more assistance more support 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.069
 that's a matter of design of each car 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.909
 in fact each different address 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.140
 and each direction inside the car extending the lever arms of the 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.389
 arms 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.709
 the little arms of the direction and this has a behavior different from 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.399
 cars who ran the study 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.889
 it perishes very heavy 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.730
 and for that very heavy hobby zimonjic durables 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.509
 there are others that naturally 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.449
 It works very well 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.800
 sinche need assistance is a matter of hygiene 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.599
 of all parties because the most advisable to reveal a crack 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.339
 put a strike to the spiral little encourage it and do whatever 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.529
 cut a lap the only thing that haunts me 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.080
 with the problems that we have 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.879
 if you heat it the spring loses all the attention on how to function 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.569
 because the spring that a special normalization once they have hindered 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.039
 we made a program about it 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.080
 the thread at 0 when turning the machine 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.240
 and this is normal and they are given heat treatment for what 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.969
 precisely function indefinitely does not split 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.939
 I hope someone will cover all their properties the spring 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.279
 end when you cut not 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.240
 a spiral in what he has to do to ccoo support him 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.879
 to top it off to have this export score here 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.110
 is the car to lower this foot ratio 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 but the spring hit much harder because in the same space to have less 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.099
 stretch hundreds of cars very much 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.879
 if he will serve berto 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.059
 made hacksaw 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.210
 or with July the court 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.550
 the spring will never put a blowtorch because 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.680
 the attention of the rest is lost 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.360
 the last decree 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.910
 the sudden back I think you can exclude partner affects the entity but 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.960
 profoundly loss of knowledge 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.210
 the fact that it would be an interesting feature is that it has 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.189
 what to receive 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.259
 and criticizes that gets up 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.909
 there is no peace there are cases of geometry 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.469
 because press the tires are placed on the same tour 2 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.629
 losing stability obviously goes up but if you have a problem that is 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.629
 pity in fact that navarra that goes from Chassis alfonsin has 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.589
 or try the pint and they put a 61 in cash on the corduroy bar 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.949
 that bar what are they used to use the advice of the curves 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.339
 the car does not show up like this 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.769
 as you do not sweat djellaba rest planita was the bar does not affect 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.419
 much this distance to average this lift the car varroa karin 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.199
 very final 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.160
 the sailor who 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.869
 now seen that yes 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.969
 this is with you with a low-road bump, slowness, peace, another reason to leash 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.139
 because álava regeneration then not advisable to do this 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.469
 every year unless it is relocated to the Barranquillera support it by hiring 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:33.520
 almost parallel 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.960
 josé so that we do not end effect right in the back
