00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
think that's missing from this case is a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
think that's missing from this case is a
cutout<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> front<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.780> the

cutout here on the front for the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
earpiece which means you will have to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.219 
earpiece which means you will have to
