00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.669
 Y 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.900
 as you can notice I have some tabs 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.900
 totally filthy full of a lot 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 Mascara glue leader of everything that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.859
 you can imagine including the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 impurities and well let's use a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.910
 container like these also what 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 we will set a desmaquillante 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.010
 biphasic and well this we will warn you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
 in the container and then we're going to put 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 what is the tab which we are going to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.030
 give him some movements and this we are going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.180
 let stand at least 5 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.659
 minutes after this we're going to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.489
 withdraw and we will start to withdraw everything 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.710
 what is the glue on this tab 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 as you can notice, I am 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.019
 doing with nails remember to have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.699
 his hands totally clean and well this 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.010
 I do it like that because I feel that 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.960
 I have more control not to mistreat 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.839
 too much process bristles too 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.339
 you can use any clip or what 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.229
 you more prefer or with what 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.839
 you more accommodate that this is what 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.729
 most important after we will use 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.040
 some brush that is especially 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.020
 used for lashes and what I'm going 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 to do is like to go combing them this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.970
 will help a lot to withdraw 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 all the excess mask for eyelashes 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.440
 and how can you notice is totally 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 clean then we will pass them in a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.080
 little bit of water with a drop of soap 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 antibacterial this is very important already 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 that the eyelashes also pick up 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 too much bacteria then too 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 we have to eliminate those that we are going to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.950
 happen and we're going to give you here a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.350
 movement like we were 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.659
 lavender by rinsing them and we're going to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.009
 leave there about a minute in what 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.110
 that we are doing this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.310
 movement to remove all those 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.649
 impurities that this may have 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.509
 then we are simply going to move them to 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.430
 clean water and we're going to give you here 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.920
 new another movement as we finish it 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.259
 to do with soapy water so that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.570
 Rinse everything it contains 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.049
 soap and a little bit of what's left of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.909
 some impurity after simply the 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.950
 we are going to withdraw from the water as you 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.349
 can see is quite flexible because 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.140
 it's totally clean and we're going to 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.330
 put in some wipe this we 're going to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 do to remove all the excess 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 of water that it may have and will be 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.480
 the way we're going to dry it in 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.000
 no time are we going to rub it or 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.100
 much less simply to taps 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.380
 let's remove all the excess water 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.569
 that it may have and as you can see 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.450
 in no time he was mistreated at all 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.910
 the tab was pretty good very very 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.319
 very clean and that is the most important thing and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.349
 Well, after that they will be able to put 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.480
 put back in what is case or what 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.130
 that you prefer and so girls 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.410
 we will be able to reuse our 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.239
 false eyelashes and well that has been 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.160
 all for today remember to leave me
