take part of this presale they might do

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
take part of this presale they might do
it<00:01:01.649> where<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.340> straight<00:01:03.000> walk<00:01:03.300> up

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it where you have to do straight walk up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
it where you have to do straight walk up
to<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> window<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.409> only<00:01:04.799> take<00:01:04.920> care<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to a window they might only take care of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
to a window they might only take care of
sales<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> arena<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.860> likely

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
sales in the arena but more than likely

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500 
sales in the arena but more than likely
what<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> let

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
what I think they're going to do is let

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.090 
what I think they're going to do is let
these<00:01:09.689> people<00:01:09.810> go<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> their<00:01:10.590> cell<00:01:10.830> phones

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
these people go on to their cell phones

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.300 
these people go on to their cell phones
and<00:01:11.430> buy<00:01:12.390> tickets<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> ticketmaster<00:01:13.680> app

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and buy tickets to the ticketmaster app

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
and buy tickets to the ticketmaster app
if<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> be

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
if they do do that there is going to be

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
if they do do that there is going to be
a<00:01:16.710> pre-sale<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.460> than<00:01:17.490> likely<00:01:17.610> will

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a pre-sale that more than likely will

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
a pre-sale that more than likely will
leak<00:01:18.299> tonight<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> first<00:01:20.159> time<00:01:20.340> I've

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
leak tonight this is the first time I've

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
leak tonight this is the first time I've
ever<00:01:20.580> done<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.210> there's<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> whole<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
ever done this so there's a whole lot of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
ever done this so there's a whole lot of
questions<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:22.979> my<00:01:23.159> guess<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.520> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
questions about it but my guess is that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
questions about it but my guess is that
they<00:01:24.060> might<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.540> release<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.229> certain

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
they might only release a certain

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
they might only release a certain
percentage<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> tickets<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.540> maybe<00:01:27.780> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
percentage of tickets like maybe they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
percentage of tickets like maybe they
might<00:01:28.110> only<00:01:28.350> sell<00:01:28.650> ten<00:01:28.950> percent<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> tickets

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
might only sell ten percent of tickets

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
might only sell ten percent of tickets
tonight<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.530> might<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:32.100> everything<00:01:32.490> up

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
tonight or they might put everything up

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.929 
tonight or they might put everything up
for<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> small<00:01:34.320> window<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:34.979> 3-4<00:01:35.610> hours

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
for a small window maybe 3-4 hours

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.880 
for a small window maybe 3-4 hours
