 my roommate my family 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.820
 one would ask you then 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.219
 probably say yes I have a little 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.580
 Problem I'm a little pumpkin 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.100
 addictive one can say that 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.439
 I've been pumping lately all the time 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.260

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 nobody before the pumpkin puree itself 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.040
 can make 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.480
 because as in Germany could that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.160
 unfortunately not like the amis just in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 but we have to do that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 themselves but do not worry, makes the going 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 super easy and in addition to it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 used 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 every recipe is a spice mix 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 pumpkin pie spits or pumpkin spits the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 I mixed it all together 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 I just link you in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 recipe for it in the infobox I wish 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.079
 Have fun with the video and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.120
 Let's go before we start with the right one 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 Recipes beginning must be like pumpkin puree 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.860
 we only need to produce it 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 One or two hokkaido pumpkins for that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.729
 But one recipe is enough for you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.119
 Of course, you can prepare for stock 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 and we will wash them first 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.100
 remove larger parts and then 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.990
 bisect 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.610
 after that you only have to go with the core 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 scrape out a spoon 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 and then you can start the pumpkins 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540
 cut into larger slices 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.790
 about two to three inches thick 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.009
 distributed as evenly as possible then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.020
 regularly on a baking sheet and does 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 It just like it is in the oven 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.530
 at about 180 degrees for 40 minutes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.939
 if the whole 40 minutes was in the oven 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 can fork prick her time with the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.799
 and if everything is beautiful soft then comes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
 Just put it in the mixer with something 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.780
 water together and finish pumpkin 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 Puree the first recipe I have with you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.030
 want to share is a pumpkin maple syrup 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.479
 Muesli with walnuts and for that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.619
 We first oatmeal maple syrup 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.540
 pumpkin puree walnuts cane sugar and a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.759
 bit pumpkins price spice mix 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.099
 exactly in the information are in the infobox 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.110
 First she drops the oatmeal 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.660
 a bowl together with the walnuts 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.000
 and then you can do that too 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.330
 Add maple syrup then give it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.580
 Add the pumpkin puree to two tablespoons 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.470
 brown sugar and so much of the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.390
 Spice mix as you would like 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.530
 maybe say a tablespoon 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.910
 a little bit more if you want 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.950
 and then you just do the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.459
 to mix until the oatmeal 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.200
 Slowly with the liquids 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 mix and become lumpy when the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.319
 master is still too dry you can 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.150
 either maple syrup or pumpkin puree 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.379
 to give it if that's something she needs 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 I would like to bleak you then 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.069
 maple syrup recommend this will mix 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.480
 here is not very with pleasure 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.010
 the user from the store is this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.989
 Mix here not very sweet 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.580
 if you have mixed the mass give 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.459
 Just put it on a with a something 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.959
 Baking paper lined baking tray and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.239
 starts cramping with your hands too 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.129
 make all possible possible 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.930
 the same size as you have otherwise 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.790
 you end up with a lot of big clubs and 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.379
 We do not want a few individual ones 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.000
 that means you do it a bit 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.190
 the hand and tries everything evenly 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690
 to get big 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.880
 and then it comes in the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.940
 oven for about 15 minutes 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.310
 180 ° tries to prevent that the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.560
 mollie and one should burn and afterwards 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.750
 It looks and is actually like that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.490
 already finished then you can the cereal 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.880
 for example, in such a müli glass fill 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.370
 or serve delicious with a little yoghurt 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.170
 and apple and maybe even one more 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.940
 little syrup on top like this 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.730
 as seen here in the shell I have 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.200
 very eager to have breakfast and that 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.770
 the first recipe was already the second 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.210
 Recipe are pumpkin apple pancakes these 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.160
 I've often had pantex instagram 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.560
 shown and you wanted to have the recipe 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.590
 So here is and these are the ingredients 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 you need her for the pancakes 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:57.590
 first needs 50 grams of pumpkin puree 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 some flour some milk baking powder one 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.540
 apple and of course the pumpkins if 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.520
 spice mixture the pantech dough 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.640
 It is very easy to do that 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.040
 first told her the egg along with 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.190
 the pumpkin puree in a bowl until 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.510
 everything has mixed evenly and 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.090
 then you just start the rest 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.919
 ingredients to stir and that first 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.220
 the flour you need about that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.169
 Give her four to five tablespoons 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.580
 also one teaspoon baking powder added 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.560
 a teaspoon of neutral vegetable oil 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.720
 so much spice mix beer would like and 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.669
 then the whole betrays with milk I 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.440
 have about five to six tablespoons 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.540
 milk taken depending on how tall you are 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.820
 you have to look how much flour and milk 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.440
 you then turn actually takes it 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.750
 Let's wash our apple and halve it 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.450
 and remove the core case and 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.770
 cut it into thin slices and then 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.660
 Let's start with the roast 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.220
 Heat a pan on medium 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.790
 temperature spreads a bit of oil 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.100
 it 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.140
 then you fill the dough in the pan 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.090
 I use about two percent of that 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.650
 Esslöffel about actually is the size 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.750
 leave you to try to make sure 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.970
 that all Pantex equal as possible 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.980
 are so that the construction times are similar 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.350
 otherwise you will burn yourself in the end 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.660
 smallest and then it should be like that 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.400
 look and when you're done with it 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.060
 can you begin the apple slices if 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.760
 the commuters 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.160
 just put on as many as you can 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.540
 fit or as you want 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.700
 if you want to know they were 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.260
 pancakes are ready to turn around 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.270
 you just wait until I'm on top of that 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.770
 surface formed small bubbles 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.620
 and then mostly that is 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.970
 bottom already clear and that was it 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.500
 even now you have the pancakes 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.060
 only serve 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.710
 and I have three here 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.710
 stacked on top of each other and with something 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.590
 maple syrup poured over it is a very 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.110
 delicious breakfast and it is also very 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.740
 filling and super autumnal with the 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.479
 spices and the apples and that was it 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.660
 Also a super easy recipe 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.720
 this is not art and the last one 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.470
 prescription are about relatively healthy voted 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.790
 Muffins and you need the following 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.460
 ingredients brewed 100 grams of pumpkin puree 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.680
 180 grams of flour a quarter teaspoon 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.690
 baking powder 2 sv horn syrup two 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.660
 tablespoon of brown sugar a ripe 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:19.970
 banana some salt and some pumpkins 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.169
 bass spice mixture and then we introduce 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.150
 even the dough ago 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.970
 That is how we touch it 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.280
 pancakes first the egg together with the 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.490
 pumpkin puree to a uniform 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.780
 mass and when you are finished 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.090
 then we just start the 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.250
 to add remaining ingredients first 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.110
 Let's start with the banana I'm using 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.990
 a fork crushed so the sense 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.960
 Fine has become of it and afterwards 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.970
 follow the dry ingredients as for 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.280
 For example, the flour water spoonwise 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.710
 mixed with the baking powder and raise 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.039
 could and then each a tablespoon 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.710
 from the museum and a tablespoon of sugar 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.530
 The whole thing will then with a pinch 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.760
 salt and of course the punk n space 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.979
 spice i also have one here 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.909
 tablespoon used seasoned and then is 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:09.619
 the dough actually ready 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.179
 if you are finished with the dough then 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:12.799
 He starts him in a few baking cups 

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:14.779
 I have to fill in here again 

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:17.839
 silicone mold taken because there this 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.699
 recipe is free, the dough is made 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:20.629
 quite normal paper movies relative 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.309
 difficult to solve 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:24.559
 then the muffins come in the 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:27.199
 oven legs does have uncommon 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:28.909
 baked for about 20 minutes at 180 ° 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.649
 simply stands times with a 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.959
 wooden sticks in to see 

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:35.299
 the dough is ready and that's it 

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:39.889
 already the finished recipe and that was 

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:41.389
 my pumpkins recipes with pumpkin puree 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.090
 If I see it that way then I get 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.169
 smooth again hunger I hope the whole 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.050
 you liked it 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:50.150
