to plant those and like make cool

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
to plant those and like make cool
treehouses<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.460> different<00:00:35.790> environments<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
treehouses in different environments of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
treehouses in different environments of
those<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.860> come<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.040> purple

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

those and see if they come out purple
and<00:00:38.879> pink<00:00:39.450> trees<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> think<00:00:40.680> that's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and pink trees because I think that's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.280 
and pink trees because I think that's
pretty<00:00:41.190> cool

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
pretty cool

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.139 
pretty cool
so<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> found<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.969> kind

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
so what I found about this is it's kind

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
so what I found about this is it's kind
of<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> forest<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:46.500> different<00:00:46.800> color

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of like a forest or different color

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.790 
of like a forest or different color
trees<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:47.969> down<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.800> which

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
trees to kind of go down like this which

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
trees to kind of go down like this which
I<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:51.180> isn't<00:00:51.300> any<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.719> different

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I like there isn't any like different

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.170 
I like there isn't any like different
monsters<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.710> I've<00:00:52.920> seen<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.489> far<00:00:53.520> there's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
monsters from I've seen so far there's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
monsters from I've seen so far there's
I'm<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.600> fairy<00:00:54.899> pixel<00:00:55.469> guys

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I'm like a little fairy pixel guys

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
I'm like a little fairy pixel guys
running<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.539> sprig<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> new<00:00:57.809> pixel<00:00:58.170> dust

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
running around sprig the new pixel dust

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.119 
running around sprig the new pixel dust
but<00:00:59.489> um<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> rich<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> comes

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
but um it's kind of rich when it comes

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
but um it's kind of rich when it comes
to<00:01:03.409> items<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.920> iron<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> cold<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to items like iron and cold they kind of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
to items like iron and cold they kind of
just<00:01:06.810> sit<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.229> front<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.950> front<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
just sit out in front of you in front of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.240 
just sit out in front of you in front of
nowhere<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.260> grab<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
nowhere and you can just grab it like in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
nowhere and you can just grab it like in
the<00:01:11.340> opening<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> cool<00:01:12.990> I've

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the opening so that's kind of cool I've

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
the opening so that's kind of cool I've
seen<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.740> diamonds<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.310> laying

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
seen a couple of diamonds just laying

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
seen a couple of diamonds just laying
around<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> number<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.470> thing

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
around and I think the number one thing

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.550 
around and I think the number one thing
though<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> show<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:19.110> me<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
though is if I can show you for me is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
though is if I can show you for me is
they<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.700> these<00:01:20.880> ultimate<00:01:21.750> thick<00:01:22.790> trees<00:01:24.049> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
they have these ultimate thick trees so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
they have these ultimate thick trees so
I<00:01:25.080> mean<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.680> trying<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> collect<00:01:26.310> wood

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
I mean if you're trying to collect wood

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
I mean if you're trying to collect wood
these<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.960> thick<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
these are really really thick and if you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.090 
these are really really thick and if you
just<00:01:29.130> cut<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> bottom<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.680> like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just cut the bottom of them you get like

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
just cut the bottom of them you get like
20<00:01:32.850> pieces<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.180> wood<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:34.140> such<00:01:34.710> thick

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
20 pieces of wood there's such thick

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.620 
20 pieces of wood there's such thick
looking<00:01:35.520> trees<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.509> much

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
looking trees as you can see so much

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
looking trees as you can see so much
wood<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> half<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
wood here and that's like half the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
wood here and that's like half the
treats<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> wood<00:01:40.140> though<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.710> dirt

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
treats like the wood though the dirt

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.270 
treats like the wood though the dirt
kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> took<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.939> tree<00:01:43.130> that's<00:01:44.130> just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
kind of took over that tree that's just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
kind of took over that tree that's just
the<00:01:44.369> bottom<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:44.820> layers<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.500> these

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the bottom two layers so like all these

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.310 
the bottom two layers so like all these
trees<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.570> massively<00:01:48.570> huge<00:01:49.350> except<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> one

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
trees are massively huge except that one

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.539 
trees are massively huge except that one
I'm<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.740> real<00:01:52.890> them<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'm like it for real them as you see how
