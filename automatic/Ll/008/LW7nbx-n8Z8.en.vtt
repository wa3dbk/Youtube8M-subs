has an expanded color gamut now if you
remember<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> XP<00:00:19.230> r8<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.770> Sony<00:00:19.980> put<00:00:20.130> out<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
remember the XP r8 that Sony put out a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.830 
remember the XP r8 that Sony put out a
few<00:00:20.430> years<00:00:20.490> ago<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.270> their<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
few years ago that was their one of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.269 
few years ago that was their one of
their<00:00:21.930> first<00:00:22.050> triluminos<00:00:22.470> displays<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
their first triluminos displays and it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.060 
their first triluminos displays and it
had<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.670> RGB<00:00:24.359> LED<00:00:25.109> backlighting<00:00:25.619> system<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
had an RGB LED backlighting system a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
had an RGB LED backlighting system a
direct<00:00:26.430> lit<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:26.970> actual<00:00:27.269> red<00:00:27.539> blue<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
direct lit with actual red blue and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
direct lit with actual red blue and
green<00:00:27.930> LEDs<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.890> uses<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.279> white<00:00:29.640> edge<00:00:29.849> lit

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
green LEDs this uses a white edge lit

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
green LEDs this uses a white edge lit
system<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.960> more<00:00:31.109> cost<00:00:31.289> effective<00:00:31.800> but

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
system so it's more cost effective but

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
system so it's more cost effective but
it<00:00:32.279> maintains<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> wide<00:00:33.239> color<00:00:33.480> gamut<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it maintains that wide color gamut now I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
it maintains that wide color gamut now I
always<00:00:34.350> talk<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.130> want<00:00:35.399> an

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
always talk about how you don't want an

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.680 
always talk about how you don't want an
expanded<00:00:35.880> color<00:00:36.030> gamut<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> makes<00:00:36.510> things

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
expanded color gamut it makes things

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
expanded color gamut it makes things
look<00:00:36.780> cartoony<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.469> Sony<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> pairing<00:00:38.700> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
look cartoony but Sony is pairing this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
look cartoony but Sony is pairing this
with<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.300> only<00:00:39.329> camcorders<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.559> playback
