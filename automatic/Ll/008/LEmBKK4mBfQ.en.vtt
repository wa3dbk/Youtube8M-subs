00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 It is very special to me because I train 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.960
 to go play but isel isel 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 we prefer do the exercises on you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 horse and your horse will then walk 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 The intention is that you do the exercises this way 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.290
 that you do not disturb your horse 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.600
 he does gallop in such a round 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.230
 and stretch your front leg you go with you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 head to your legs 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 these are still the simple stretching exercises and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 what do you call state just not flag 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.949
 yes that is one of the seven fly 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 you can grow on your hand and you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.699
 knees sit down 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 the exercises you do it there 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 you need some kind of relaxation 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 are you must relax with your horse 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.770
 be able to move you need a little nimble 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 so you need for example one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 being able to make splits on your horse and that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 also adds a bit of strength 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.430
 look 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.780
 a kind of gymnastics but with one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 horse difficulty factor 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.530
 it really feels like a mine for the first time 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.570
 horse is looking for high shoulders 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.729
 downwards forward above the well 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 stay good with your shoulders oh yes and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.170
 now you can have a foot 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.170
 lift 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.650
 yes very well it can be even higher 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.509
 super and now your left arm also up 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.140
 in front of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.090
 yes if you have a match you are true 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.130
 if such a match consists of then start 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.990
 I do with the compulsory exercises 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.450
 seven prescribed exercises that the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.270
 jury piece by piece 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 value then you have technical test and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.409
 then you have another cure and you can 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 think up completely yourself is not that 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.520
 your knees with the complaint 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 maybe one of my shoulders 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.460
 Grab hold and use me as one of them 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.950

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.950
 and can stand god very well 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.120
