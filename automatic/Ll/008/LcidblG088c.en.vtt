00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hello everyone, I decided to make a new one. 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.300
 transfer video more precisely on cloning 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 hdd disk to new ssd license disk 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.660
 81 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.920
 and so there are a couple of problems with which i 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.880
 faced but think 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.890
 solving this problem will help you or 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 future to my subscribers or maybe 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.550
 people who will search by request 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.080
 this problem so the situation is that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.070
 in my laptop before installed 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 license 81 windows and the winchester is broken 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.770
 on two disks is the system target disk on 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.540
 dressy 8 gigabyte and local drive d it 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.800
 400 gigabytes and this is one hard drive and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.039
 drive too ssd wardrobe what's new problem 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 that when cloning 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.699
 acronis program 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.449
 she has no single transfer function 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.320
 partition it carries the entire disk 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 one to one 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.060
 if the hdd drive had two partitions 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 system and local that from on ssd 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 it will also create a fully system and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 additionally local disk is local 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.189
 problems that I encountered before 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.040
 The Samsung utility 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.310
 together with her daughter called samsung micro 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.310
 Sham this utility is not at it I was her 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 deleted there was the possibility of a veil of transference 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.990
 only one system partition on ssd 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.930
 drive that i did but after 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 cloning a single partition using 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.750
 this utility samsunga migration windows 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.350
 started but start terribly slow and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.600
 sometimes sometimes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.299
 blue screen of death many people think 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.509
 what is it when windows 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.280
 just a glitch catches and everything after 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.729
 This I took back with the handle this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
 windows and now started trying others 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.409
 ways there is another program for 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.200
 planning a good paragon but paragon 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.550
 also a lot of complaints about 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.290
 licenses 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.210
 when we transfer we clone the system disk 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 license parties and you don't know your 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.080
 key or it just does not fit 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 if you and u even found out through for food for 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.710
 activation of your windows and then paragon 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.470
 plans but windows will require you 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.710
 activation is such an opportunity 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.010
 so I did not particularly risk I 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.410
 downloaded all verified acronis true 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.990
 image and additionally downloaded acronis 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 disk director 12 for what it is needed 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.950
 let's explain 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.740
 and so that I can only transfer one 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.750
 system disk without additional 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.170
 local 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 to ssd horse split into two disks 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:05.160
 what i did i open first thing 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 Acronis disk director 12 and see our 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.740
 here is the system boot up to restore and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.770
 here are our disks that are shown 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:21.380
 system local disk d i just 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:24.209
 just delete the volume so confirm 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.980
 delete it then it becomes with us 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.690
 unallocated disk is removed 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:39.260
 close the program open acronis true 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.260
 image 2015 and turn cloning 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.120
 you can click in the automatic source 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:53.370
 drive here we have it 700 gigabytes click 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:58.440
 further and target disk we will have ssd 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.300
 drive click further here with us 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.489
 warns that the disk is all there 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.820
 it contained it will be formatted 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.820
 press ok 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.120
 what state had 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.640
 had sdk before cloning here it is one 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.090
 whole drive and what will be able 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.310
 have after cloning 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.949
 here we have shows that we will have 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.449
 one system disk c for two hundred twenty 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:34.330
 two gigabytes and will also be copied 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:38.270
 these internal sections recovery system &amp; 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.770
 restore backup to or from us and 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.889
 as you can see d disk we do not have although he 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.080
 my previous tests constantly 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.320
 appeared and even if you press 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.740
 file exclusion itself 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.940
 the program here we had c and d 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.770
 if you exclude put a tick d and so 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.610
 same start cloning it anyway 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.040
 transferred two sections to ssd skin 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.000
 got off to create a meme two sections that 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.630
 not very desirable for me so 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.260
 how if we plan on ssd 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:22.520
 system on the price stannis c disk then 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.800
 after we can't d disk merge with this 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.260
 system disk can be two local 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.080
 disk combine but local and 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.539
 system merge is no longer possible 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.440
 only such a way out only such 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.110
 I found a way out with the help of delete 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.880
 local disk so that it is unallocated 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.620
 free space and plan 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:53.349
 only one disk on one disk that's what we 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.349
 we get our own choose target ok 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:07.990
 and we get what we needed and 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:10.120
 click proceed now the system will be 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.939
 clone and require reload 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.060
 computer so guys now he will leave 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.979
 in reboot and will be inside already 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.569
 the system will already be planning to 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:24.219
 completely all sections of direct and cache and there 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.310
 in the morning you don't know everything like that there 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:30.039
 specifically everything is called but be all 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.840
 carry already inside systematically okay 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:35.169
 continue after 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.479
 disk cloning continue video 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.280
 coding a complete laptop would have snow 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.219
 booted cloning was 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.280
 about three or four minutes, and so with our 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:49.270
 Dasha became as the main system 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.430
 drive c 220 gigabytes because we gigabyte 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.219
 Acronis collected for recovery 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.199
 System is the case if the Windows bend 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:59.229
 then our will be from what to recover 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.300
 restore windows and hd drive from us 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:07.919
 I have 270 gigabytes left 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:12.610
 formatted in order to merge 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:16.750
 free space restore from 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:23.289
 regulations we are no longer needed here 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:26.759
 he and his also delete and to disk 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.759
 add all free space 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:35.289
 and then click apply 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:51.210
 close the program open the explorer 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:54.930
 and get what they wanted one 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:58.740
 ssd system disk and separate media 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:03.419
 local hdd drive for roughly 700 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:06.360
 gigabytes all the guys here such such here 

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:08.610
 cloning videos and small 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.960
 solving small problems if the video 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.099
 was helpful or you liked it
