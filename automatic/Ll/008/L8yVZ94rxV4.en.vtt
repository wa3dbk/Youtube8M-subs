00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.600
hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder from cars dot
com I'm gonna give you the rundown on

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.689
the 2008 Scion xB

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.280
now the original Scion came out a few
years ago was a surprise hit

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.840
its small and boxy the new version is
larger in almost every way

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.900
it's longer its wider and has a longer
wheelbase on and they've also

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.189
rounded off a bit as you can see in the
hood there's more rank to the windshield

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.069
it doesn't have quite as boxy look

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.989
and the same is true for the roof and
the rear obviously the increase in

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.430
exterior size has meant

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
more space inside now the cargo is
pretty versatile

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm this is getting to be very common
feel if the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.859
cargo floor there are some storage
apartments here in case you want to put

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.769
something valuable works out of sight

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.129
on and on either side also there are a
couple event

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.539
folding the seats good hardly be easier
pretty standard stuff

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.359
Scion has very few factory options the
automatic transmission is one of them

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.499
aside from that just about everything
can be bought a la carte you on one

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.589
thing or another thing you choose it you
don't have to get a package for the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.100
things you might or might not want as
you can see I have plenty leg room here

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.170
how about six feet on the seats pretty
much all the way back in front of me

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.970
also my knees are traced to much plenty
of headroom several inches

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.240
up in the previous version in the car
which was so small looking from the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.820
outside

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.110
it was a big surprise to find a good
deal in room inside

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.160
which it had to in this case it's a
little bit less surprising

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.640
but it's definitely roomy enough to
carry 45 people

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
no problems in terms of leg room appear
in front

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.460
%uh headroom also was good fortunately
there's a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.050
manual see height adjustment also the
steering wheel Telus

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.710
unfortunately doesn't telescope one
distinguishing characteristics that the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.410
XB

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.420
is as before center mounted gauges

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.540
now center mount a gauge is a
controversial some people

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.120
really hate them I don't mind them
because I put the steering wheel low and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.690
it tends to blockade is when they ran
from the steering wheel

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.420
it really depends on the car at San in
terms of comfort there's a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.000
center armrest for the driver that is a
ridiculously

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.239
narrow and small and couple about
drivers found to be too high not very

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.849
comfortable

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.100
it in some ways might as well not be
there terms and covered storage it's not

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.420
great the center

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.760
unlikely to get a fist in there
obviously you've got your glove

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.300
compartment it's a good size but it does
not lock

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.340
unfortunately science seems to be better
with the open stores like I've been here

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.960
little things here and there sunglasses
fit in there just fine

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.030
another great standard feature or
features I should say

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.690
are is apparent puts for mp3 players

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.580
now you might have seen in the past a
regular auxiliary output for an analog

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.380
court like this you can run any player
even a laptop or a generic

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.480
mp3 player like this that cheapos like
me by or

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.970
if you are the type to use an iPod
there's a separate Jack

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.960
that with a special plug allows you not
only to play the iPod

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.430
but also to control it through the head
unit here in the dashboard

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.500
as standard stereos go with the inputs
for regular mp3 player and iPod it's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.290
pretty impressive for additional
information on this car or any other

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.110
