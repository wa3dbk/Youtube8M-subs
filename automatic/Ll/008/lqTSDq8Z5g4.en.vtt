Year's Eve about 310 mountain time 2011
what<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.250> looking<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.580> as<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> stereo<00:00:09.120> be<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
what I'm looking at as a stereo be a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.730 
what I'm looking at as a stereo be a
chai<00:00:10.410> two<00:00:10.469> spacecraft<00:00:11.429> image<00:00:12.710> they<00:00:13.710> have

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
chai two spacecraft image they have

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.420 
chai two spacecraft image they have
updated<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.670> images<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.389> stereo<00:00:15.630> ahead

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
updated some images on the stereo ahead

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.480 
updated some images on the stereo ahead
but<00:00:17.430> very<00:00:18.359> few<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.010> only<00:00:20.250> goes<00:00:20.460> up

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
but very few this one here only goes up

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.460 
but very few this one here only goes up
to<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.970> 30th<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.689> no<00:00:21.810> images<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
to the 30th there are no images on the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.310 
to the 30th there are no images on the
31st<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.449> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> want<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> look

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you see that looks like a giant rod

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790 
you see that looks like a giant rod
that's<00:00:32.940> got<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> triangle<00:00:33.899> shape<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.410> off<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that's got a triangle shape on off the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.910 
that's got a triangle shape on off the
back<00:00:35.010> end<00:00:35.280> front<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.590> these<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.800> on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
there i'm going to put magnifier on it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.130 
there i'm going to put magnifier on it
please<00:01:06.960> bear<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.260> me<00:01:08.450> get<00:01:09.450> close<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.840> with

out here it is super enlarged it's right
there<00:01:29.899> same<00:01:30.899> spacecraft<00:01:33.049> same<00:01:34.049> dates<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
there same spacecraft same dates in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.690 
there same spacecraft same dates in
question<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> twenty-ninth<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
question on the twenty-ninth it's right

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
question on the twenty-ninth it's right
there<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> magnifier<00:01:40.679> on<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.979> one

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
there and put the magnifier on it one

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899 
there and put the magnifier on it one
more<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:42.979> real<00:01:43.979> close-up<00:01:44.280> look<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.789> this

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
more time real close-up look at this

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.830 
more time real close-up look at this
thing<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:46.229> did<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:46.950> there

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.919 

what<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.959> world<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> put<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> in

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
what in the world is a so I put it in

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.539 
what in the world is a so I put it in
the<00:01:54.990> photo<00:01:55.440> enhancer<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.429> do

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the photo enhancer I'm just going to do

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.830 
the photo enhancer I'm just going to do
it<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:56.940> front<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> change<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it right in front of you change the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.190 
it right in front of you change the
exposures<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.100> same<00:02:00.200> same

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
exposures it's right there same same

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.309 
exposures it's right there same same
image<00:02:01.619> stereo<00:02:02.069> behind<00:02:02.630> same<00:02:03.630> date<00:02:04.340> 29th<00:02:06.319> two

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
image stereo behind same date 29th two

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.309 
image stereo behind same date 29th two
days<00:02:07.530> ago<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:09.119> adjust<00:02:09.479> exposures<00:02:10.019> real

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
days ago it's just adjust exposures real

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.289 
days ago it's just adjust exposures real
quick<00:02:12.049> we<00:02:13.049> would<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> better<00:02:13.680> look<00:02:13.799> at<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
quick we would get a better look at it I

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.620 
quick we would get a better look at it I
don't<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.080> what<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.640> it's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
don't know what that is there it is it's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.970 
don't know what that is there it is it's
right<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:21.049> clearly<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:24.780> unnatural<00:02:25.500> object

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
right there clearly an unnatural object

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
right there clearly an unnatural object
there's<00:02:26.730> no<00:02:26.880> doubt<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.209> my<00:02:27.329> mind<00:02:27.570> look<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.350> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
there's no doubt in my mind look at that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.920 
there's no doubt in my mind look at that
thing<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.440> giant<00:02:31.760> UFO<00:02:32.840> triangle<00:02:33.840> of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
thing that's a giant UFO triangle of
