00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.079 
2011 MacBook Pro just let me look at how
much<00:00:12.620> RAM<00:00:12.889> is<00:00:13.040> in<00:00:13.190> this<00:00:13.309> one<00:00:13.519> that<00:00:13.759> I've<00:00:13.880> got

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
much RAM is in this one that I've got

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.999 
much RAM is in this one that I've got
here's<00:00:14.420> my<00:00:14.780> weak<00:00:15.019> one<00:00:15.230> it's<00:00:15.620> got<00:00:15.769> four

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
here's my weak one it's got four

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.580 
here's my weak one it's got four
gigabytes<00:00:16.460> of<00:00:16.700> RAM<00:00:16.880> installed<00:00:17.349> and<00:00:18.349> we<00:00:18.439> can

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
gigabytes of RAM installed and we can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.170 
gigabytes of RAM installed and we can
see<00:00:18.740> from<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:19.040> system<00:00:19.340> information<00:00:19.550> applet

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
see from the system information applet

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.990 
see from the system information applet
that<00:00:20.360> consists<00:00:21.079> of<00:00:21.200> two<00:00:21.860> two<00:00:22.610> gigabyte

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
that consists of two two gigabyte

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.150 
that consists of two two gigabyte
modules<00:00:23.329> so<00:00:24.110> we're<00:00:24.230> gonna<00:00:24.349> upgrade<00:00:24.500> those<00:00:24.890> two

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
modules so we're gonna upgrade those two

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.889 
modules so we're gonna upgrade those two
to<00:00:25.309> four<00:00:25.640> gigabyte<00:00:25.970> modules<00:00:26.329> and<00:00:26.630> give<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.840> a

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
to four gigabyte modules and give it a

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.990 
to four gigabyte modules and give it a
big<00:00:27.020> performance<00:00:27.200> boost<00:00:27.770> so<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:28.730> get<00:00:28.820> started

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that we've got the screws removes we're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
that we've got the screws removes we're
gonna<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.830> bottom<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> case<00:02:05.220> off

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
gonna take the bottom of the case off

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.139 
gonna take the bottom of the case off
you<00:02:05.670> see<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> lifts<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:06.509> from<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.869> front

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
you see it just lifts off from the front

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.190 
you see it just lifts off from the front
put<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.539> side<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.390> location<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
put that to one side and the location of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400 
put that to one side and the location of
the<00:02:13.350> memory<00:02:13.620> modules<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.220> pretty<00:02:14.970> easy<00:02:15.410> I'm

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the memory modules is pretty easy I'm

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.690 
the memory modules is pretty easy I'm
just<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> touch<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> case<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
just going to touch the case that you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
just going to touch the case that you
see<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> make<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.450> there's<00:02:18.630> no<00:02:18.750> static

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
see just to make sure there's no static

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.170 
see just to make sure there's no static
build-up<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.280> my<00:02:20.340> body<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:20.819> where<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
memory modules are and it'll Jakob is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.650 
memory modules are and it'll Jakob is
also<00:02:25.920> gonna<00:02:26.130> point<00:02:26.430> -<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> hard<00:02:27.420> drive

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
also gonna point - that's the hard drive

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.460 
also gonna point - that's the hard drive
Thank<00:02:28.230> You<00:02:28.319> Jacob<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.020> bit<00:02:31.200> more<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
Thank You Jacob you know a bit more of a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.809 
Thank You Jacob you know a bit more of a
close-up<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.519> close-up

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
close-up so you can you have a close-up

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.059 
close-up so you can you have a close-up
of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> modules<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.870> using<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.290> clean

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
of the modules I'm just using a clean

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.630 
of the modules I'm just using a clean
and<00:02:35.280> dry<00:02:35.459> paint<00:02:35.819> brush<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.420> remove<00:02:36.510> some<00:02:36.959> dust

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
and dry paint brush to remove some dust

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.740 
and dry paint brush to remove some dust
from<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> battery<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.269> they'll<00:02:39.450> often

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
from the battery there they'll often

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.540 
from the battery there they'll often
will<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> bit<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.410> dust<00:02:40.620> inside<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.160> case<00:02:41.340> if

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
will be a bit of dust inside the case if

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.610 
will be a bit of dust inside the case if
you've<00:02:41.670> had<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.910> machine<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.450> while<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you've had the machine for a while and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.050 
you've had the machine for a while and
that's<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.950> good<00:02:44.100> way<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that's a good way to do it you know the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.520 
that's a good way to do it you know the
modules<00:02:48.060> themselves<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> little<00:02:48.989> clip<00:02:49.200> on

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
modules themselves have a little clip on

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.160 
modules themselves have a little clip on
either<00:02:49.890> side<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.550> module<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.900> clip

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
either side of the module and that clip

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.220 
either side of the module and that clip
needs<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.560> pulled<00:02:52.860> out<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:54.630> release<00:02:55.049> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
needs to be pulled out to release the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.050 
needs to be pulled out to release the
module<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.890> see<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.160> sort<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.370> pops<00:02:56.549> up<00:02:56.790> as

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
module so you see it sort of pops up as

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940 
module so you see it sort of pops up as
you<00:02:57.150> remove<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.569> clip<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.830> just

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
you remove the clip then you can just

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.590 
you remove the clip then you can just
hold<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> module<00:02:59.580> by<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.760> edge<00:03:00.030> make<00:03:00.450> sure

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
hold the module by the edge make sure

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.090 
hold the module by the edge make sure
you<00:03:00.720> only<00:03:00.870> hold<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> by<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.530> edge<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.890> ever

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
you only hold it by the edge don't ever

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.220 
you only hold it by the edge don't ever
touch<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.549> gold<00:03:02.730> fingers<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.079> can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
touch the gold fingers then you can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.350 
touch the gold fingers then you can
remove<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.590> module<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.850> other<00:03:06.000> module

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
remove the module and the other module

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.660 
remove the module and the other module
is<00:03:06.540> underneath<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.860> first<00:03:08.070> one<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.489> once

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
is underneath the first one so once

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.920 
is underneath the first one so once
again<00:03:08.820> there<00:03:09.060> are<00:03:09.150> clips<00:03:09.360> holding<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.810> in

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
again there are clips holding it in

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.229 
again there are clips holding it in
place<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> little<00:03:11.549> trickier<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> remove

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
place it's a little trickier to remove

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.090 
place it's a little trickier to remove
because<00:03:12.390> you've<00:03:12.600> got<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.930> undo<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> bottom

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
because you've got to undo the bottom

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
because you've got to undo the bottom
clips<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.610> then<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.120> see<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.299> had<00:03:15.450> some

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
clips and then you can see I had some

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.180 
clips and then you can see I had some
trouble<00:03:15.900> getting<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.170> module<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.620> because

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
trouble getting that module out because

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
trouble getting that module out because
you've<00:03:17.340> also<00:03:17.459> got<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.790> move<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.780> top<00:03:18.989> clips<00:03:19.290> as

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you've also got to move the top clips as

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.460 
you've also got to move the top clips as
well<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.630> remove<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.320> module

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
well and then you can remove the module

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.500 
well and then you can remove the module
completely<00:03:23.810> out<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.200> slots<00:03:26.269> once<00:03:27.269> again

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
completely out of the slots once again

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.150 
completely out of the slots once again
making<00:03:27.720> sure<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.079> hold<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.709> by<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.980> edge

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
making sure you hold it just by the edge

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.920 
making sure you hold it just by the edge
only<00:03:31.040> okay<00:03:32.040> here's<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.400> different<00:03:32.609> angle

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
only okay here's a different angle

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.120 
only okay here's a different angle
showing<00:03:33.930> something<00:03:34.140> very<00:03:34.410> important<00:03:34.829> here's

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
showing something very important here's

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460 
showing something very important here's
a<00:03:35.220> little<00:03:35.430> guide<00:03:35.609> slot<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.180> module<00:03:36.570> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
a little guide slot on the module and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.880 
a little guide slot on the module and
then<00:03:37.650> actually<00:03:38.100> fits<00:03:38.640> into<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.000> other<00:03:39.890> guide

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
then actually fits into that other guide

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.000 
then actually fits into that other guide
on<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.150> actual<00:03:42.420> memory<00:03:43.049> slot<00:03:43.380> itself<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
on in the actual memory slot itself I

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.590 
on in the actual memory slot itself I
can<00:03:44.250> only<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.609> in<00:03:44.640> one<00:03:44.730> way<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.209> you've<00:03:45.329> got<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
can only go in one way if you've got the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.900 
can only go in one way if you've got the
modules<00:03:45.900> flipped<00:03:46.260> over<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.980> won't<00:03:47.220> fit<00:03:47.519> that's

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
modules flipped over it won't fit that's

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.780 
modules flipped over it won't fit that's
the<00:03:48.060> important<00:03:48.510> distinction<00:03:49.609> now<00:03:50.609> we're

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the important distinction now we're

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.430 
the important distinction now we're
actually<00:03:50.880> going<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.510> insert<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.140> new<00:03:52.260> module

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
actually going to insert the new module

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.580 
actually going to insert the new module
so<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.829> simply<00:03:53.150> pushed<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.299> an<00:03:54.600> angle<00:03:54.989> make

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
so you simply pushed in an angle make

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.170 
so you simply pushed in an angle make
sure<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.859> line<00:03:56.069> up<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> guys<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.730> other<00:03:56.910> make

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
sure you line up the guys the other make

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.420 
sure you line up the guys the other make
sure<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.480> firmly<00:03:57.750> seated<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.950> then<00:03:59.310> you

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
sure it's firmly seated and then you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.309 
sure it's firmly seated and then you
just<00:03:59.609> push<00:03:59.850> down<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.840> edge<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.140> module

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
just push down on the edge of the module

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.430 
just push down on the edge of the module
and<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:02.430> will<00:04:02.609> fill<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.180> here<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.720> make<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and you will fill it in here it make a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.729 
and you will fill it in here it make a
quite<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> distinct<00:04:05.310> click<00:04:05.760> as<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.660> goes<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
quite a distinct click as it goes in to

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.340 
quite a distinct click as it goes in to
the<00:04:07.829> slot<00:04:07.949> that's<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:09.180> bottom<00:04:09.419> one<00:04:09.540> first<00:04:09.780> and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
the slot that's the bottom one first and

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.880 
the slot that's the bottom one first and
then<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:11.190> line<00:04:12.060> up<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> top<00:04:12.479> one

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
then we line up the top one

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.090 
then we line up the top one
as<00:04:12.980> well<00:04:14.050> so<00:04:15.050> it's<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.319> little<00:04:15.530> bit<00:04:15.620> sticky<00:04:15.860> with

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
as well so it's a little bit sticky with

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.710 
as well so it's a little bit sticky with
the<00:04:16.220> top<00:04:16.400> one<00:04:16.549> if<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.000> don't<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:17.510> right

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
the top one if you don't get it right

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.110 
the top one if you don't get it right
just<00:04:17.750> have<00:04:18.200> another<00:04:18.380> go<00:04:18.620> you've<00:04:18.859> got<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.120> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
just have another go you've got a the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.350 
just have another go you've got a the
module<00:04:20.420> in<00:04:20.540> at<00:04:20.780> an<00:04:20.900> angle<00:04:21.049> first<00:04:21.940> make<00:04:22.940> sure<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
module in at an angle first make sure it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.930 
module in at an angle first make sure it
is<00:04:23.450> well<00:04:23.750> seated<00:04:24.320> in<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.920> slot<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:25.850> you

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
is well seated in the slot and then you

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.860 
is well seated in the slot and then you
can<00:04:26.090> push<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.420> down<00:04:28.030> making<00:04:29.030> sure<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
can push it down making sure that the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.640 
can push it down making sure that the
clips<00:04:30.410> are<00:04:30.560> engaged<00:04:30.890> on<00:04:31.250> either<00:04:31.370> side<00:04:32.650> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
clips are engaged on either side and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.560 
clips are engaged on either side and
there<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.669> have<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.940> that's<00:04:35.120> your<00:04:35.360> memory

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
there you have it that's your memory

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.340 
there you have it that's your memory
