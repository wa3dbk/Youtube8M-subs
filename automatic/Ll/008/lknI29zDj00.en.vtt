come out of the realistic setting of the
play<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.420> we<00:01:01.719> try<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:01.960> create<00:01:02.229> roughly<00:01:02.829> what

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
play and we try to create roughly what

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.740 
play and we try to create roughly what
it<00:01:03.129> would<00:01:03.309> feel<00:01:03.549> like<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.420> middle<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.689> an

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
it would feel like in the middle of an

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.489 
it would feel like in the middle of an
atomic<00:01:04.960> blast

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:06.499 
atomic blast

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.279 
atomic blast
in<00:01:06.890> what<00:01:07.039> I<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:07.249> known<00:01:07.549> for<00:01:07.579> what<00:01:08.420> you<00:01:09.140> know

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
in what I was known for what you know

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.709 
in what I was known for what you know
I'm<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.609> history<00:01:10.729> books<00:01:11.210> as<00:01:11.420> having

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
I'm in in the history books as having

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.889 
I'm in in the history books as having
done<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.289> you<00:01:13.189> know<00:01:13.369> introduced<00:01:14.060> cinema

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
done is you know introduced cinema

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.980 
done is you know introduced cinema
techniques<00:01:15.549> into<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.640> theater<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.359> think<00:01:17.630> it's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
techniques into the theater I think it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.050 
techniques into the theater I think it's
wise<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.590> develop<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> range<00:01:19.459> of<00:01:19.640> styles<00:01:19.909> both

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
wise to develop a range of styles both

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.580 
wise to develop a range of styles both
to<00:01:20.240> discover<00:01:20.509> what<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.140> write<00:01:21.319> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
to discover what you like to write and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.980 
to discover what you like to write and
to<00:01:22.310> keep<00:01:22.429> people<00:01:22.549> surprised<00:01:22.969> a<00:01:23.240> scene<00:01:23.780> on<00:01:23.959> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
to keep people surprised a scene on a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.039 
to keep people surprised a scene on a
mountaintop<00:01:24.469> next<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.789> scene<00:01:26.359> in<00:01:26.509> an<00:01:26.630> office

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
mountaintop next to a scene in an office

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.099 
mountaintop next to a scene in an office
and<00:01:27.349> then<00:01:27.560> next<00:01:27.859> to<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.520> scene<00:01:29.090> back<00:01:29.299> at<00:01:29.479> home<00:01:29.719> so

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
and then next to a scene back at home so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.349 
and then next to a scene back at home so
you've<00:01:30.319> got<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.709> have<00:01:30.740> variation<00:01:31.549> within<00:01:32.240> a

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
you've got to have variation within a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.330 
you've got to have variation within a
play<00:01:32.569> and<00:01:32.869> as<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.289> writer<00:01:33.500> different<00:01:34.099> places

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
play and as a writer different places

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.760 
play and as a writer different places
different<00:01:34.849> social<00:01:35.240> classes<00:01:35.959> different<00:01:36.349> races

different social classes different races
different<00:01:37.009> groups<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.599> obviously<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:39.439> an

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
different groups and obviously it's an

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.069 
different groups and obviously it's an
overtly<00:01:40.039> political<00:01:40.520> way<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.149> writing<00:01:41.390> but

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
overtly political way of writing but

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.889 
overtly political way of writing but
obviously<00:01:42.530> if<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.770> write<00:01:43.179> across<00:01:44.179> a<00:01:44.209> canvas

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
obviously if you write across a canvas

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.130 
obviously if you write across a canvas
of<00:01:45.640> changing<00:01:46.640> locations<00:01:47.239> and<00:01:47.450> changing<00:01:47.899> times

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
of changing locations and changing times

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.289 
of changing locations and changing times
and<00:01:48.319> changing<00:01:48.409> places<00:01:49.189> one<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.090> things

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
and changing places one of the things

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.059 
and changing places one of the things
you're<00:01:50.420> doing<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.140> making<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.619> claim<00:01:51.739> for

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
you're doing is is making a claim for

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.760 
you're doing is is making a claim for
history<00:01:52.520> which<00:01:53.209> is<00:01:53.479> that<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:54.079> aren't<00:01:54.319> just

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
history which is that we aren't just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.550 
history which is that we aren't just
people<00:01:55.459> who<00:01:55.849> live<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:56.719> it<00:01:56.899> were<00:01:57.049> in<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.319> bell<00:01:57.530> jar

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
people who live as it were in a bell jar

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.919 
people who live as it were in a bell jar
we<00:01:58.310> are<00:01:58.729> very<00:01:58.969> different<00:01:59.179> from<00:01:59.450> people<00:01:59.810> who

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
we are very different from people who

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:00.999 
we are very different from people who
lived<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.200> thousand<00:02:00.590> years<00:02:00.619> ago

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
lived a thousand years ago

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.190 
lived a thousand years ago
I<00:02:01.219> am<00:02:02.060> very<00:02:02.299> different<00:02:02.659> from<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.840> Chinese

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
peasant and one of the things that

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.369 
peasant and one of the things that
theatre<00:02:07.069> must<00:02:07.340> do<00:02:07.549> is<00:02:08.149> show<00:02:08.569> how<00:02:08.929> people

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
theatre must do is show how people

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.069 
theatre must do is show how people
became<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.280> people<00:02:10.429> they<00:02:10.729> became<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.359> what

they<00:02:12.319> might<00:02:12.560> become<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.400> their<00:02:13.579> potential

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
they might become what their potential

they might become what their potential
for<00:02:14.120> becoming<00:02:14.569> something<00:02:14.780> different<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.380> now

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
for becoming something different is now

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.280 
for becoming something different is now
I<00:02:16.220> find<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.880> very<00:02:16.940> difficult<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.959> in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
I find that very difficult to do in

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.190 
I find that very difficult to do in
plays<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:19.099> are<00:02:19.130> set<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.639> one<00:02:20.299> room<00:02:22.870> I'm<00:02:23.870> aware

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
plays that are set in one room I'm aware

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.750 
plays that are set in one room I'm aware
that<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:24.650> trying<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:24.980> imitate<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.579> real

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
that I was trying to imitate the real

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.879 
that I was trying to imitate the real
world<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.660> also<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:27.109> aware<00:02:27.139> it's<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:27.889 
world but also be aware it's not the

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.339 
world but also be aware it's not the
real<00:02:28.069> world<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.579> allows<00:02:28.849> me<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> focus<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.230> an

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
real world it allows me to focus on an

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.520 
real world it allows me to focus on an
element<00:02:30.799> of<00:02:30.889> society<00:02:31.190> or<00:02:31.880> people<00:02:32.480> which<00:02:33.260> then

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
element of society or people which then

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.640 
element of society or people which then
and<00:02:33.680> gets<00:02:33.829> them<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.099> question<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.760> know

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
and gets them to question you know

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.870 
and gets them to question you know
question<00:02:36.650> how<00:02:36.799> they<00:02:36.980> feel<00:02:37.220> about<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.669> they

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
question how they feel about that they

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.250 
question how they feel about that they
may<00:02:38.000> not<00:02:38.060> agree<00:02:38.239> they<00:02:38.630> made<00:02:38.780> hated<00:02:39.109> it's

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
may not agree they made hated it's

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.379 
may not agree they made hated it's
that's<00:02:39.739> fine<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.250> think<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> really<00:02:41.000> important

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
that's fine I think the really important

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.030 
that's fine I think the really important
thing<00:02:41.419> for<00:02:41.630> me<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:41.930> you're<00:02:42.410> true<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.739> your
