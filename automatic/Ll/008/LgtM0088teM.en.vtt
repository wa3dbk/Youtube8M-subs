00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 hi abruzzos health 1810 and in this video I will talk about the best 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.290
 Xbox 360 games 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.019
 shit you would have talked about the best ps3 games 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.209
 that I will not leave for another video cuca yacht son of a bitch already 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.679
 then let's get started 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.500
 this smells like video shit 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 if you're going to stay help me in this video or if I do not give you and a fp lr 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.380
 what is a fp lr 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.169
 a fierce kick in the crack 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.199
 then let's get started 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.720
 in number five is the cante inferno 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.620
 this game is very good the story is great and the spectacular scenarios 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.730
 the game is about that dante he was killed in a gerra but he did not want 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.070
 die so he fought against death destroyed it and he took his voice but 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.380
 when he returned home his father and his wife were dead to rescue 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.300
 his wife who had made a pact with the devil that her husband does not deceive her 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 day then dante has to rescue her because she does not die if to that fate 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.949
 because he had been at fault so it happens in the seven deadly sins 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.810
 very good the recommended game 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.080
 to me it seems a tremendous copy to the course that I saved ps3 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.869
 In the number four is Dragon Bolt Racing Lass 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.689
 This game is very good for fans of the series has characters 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.299
 very good more over has a vegeta in third level and I open the fields are 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.549
 same as the series has a good story mode and with extra phases that do not come out 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.189
 in the series so if you're a fan of the dragon bod, buy it, it's very 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:25.890
 good 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.200
 it's also for the ps3 so check it 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 in number 3 is resident evil 5 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 this game is a compliment to the resident evil saga 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.980
 because they took a lot but it was worth it with their main enemy is albert 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.690
 wesker that had not given so much prominence from the resident evil 1 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.170
 the scenarios are very real the zombies now one shits in fear xd xd xd xd 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.909
 xd xd xd 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.670
 until this game is cooperative in the mercenary 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.800
 and for a change it has a good story so it is highly recommended 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.500
 so if you have ps3 or xbox 360 go running to the store to buy floor 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.630
 in number two is weak mae cry 4 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.010
 this game is very good in that they changed the main protagonist dante but 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.120
 nero also has his thing so it's almost so cool that dante this game 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.359
 has spectacular music wonderful scenarios 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.450
 enemies as bastards as the ancient deliveries 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 the good thing that was half of the game you can handle dante so that what 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.680
 It's twice as good this game is recommended at 95% 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.889
 it is also available in ps3 and pc 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.989
 in the great position number one ecstasy crimp 2 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.739
 this game exceeded all expectations 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.230
 his control is very easy to handle the story is spectacular there are characters 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 historical as leonardo da vinci has good graphics you can ride a horse 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.359
 and kill whoever you please I spent two playing this game so it's 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.429
 100% recommended 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.629
 is just as good for the complex ps3 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.769
 well that was all so if you did not like my decision leave the comment 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.150
