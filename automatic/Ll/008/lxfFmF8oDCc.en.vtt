00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
this foundation I didn't think it was

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
luminous on the skin and for me this is

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.860 
luminous on the skin and for me this is

one spot down here but otherwise it's
fine<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.610> because<00:02:22.239> I've<00:02:22.390> been<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.569> holiday<00:02:22.959> and

because<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:46.930> know<00:02:47.049> whether<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.560> let

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
because I don't know whether to just let

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.699 
because I don't know whether to just let
it<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:49.030> its<00:02:49.060> own<00:02:49.269> luminosity<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:49.959> powder<00:02:50.350> I

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
might leave it for now and then powder

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.590 
might leave it for now and then powder
if<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.430> gets<00:02:54.609> horrific<00:02:55.150> throughout<00:02:55.389> the<00:02:55.480> day

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
my forehead is actually not that bad my

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.460 
my forehead is actually not that bad my
forehead<00:03:52.480> probably<00:03:52.780> normally<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.200> worst

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
forehead probably normally the worst

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.490 
forehead probably normally the worst
thing<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.700> goes<00:03:54.910> first<00:03:55.240> and<00:03:55.720> my<00:03:56.290> nose

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
thing and that goes first and my nose

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.050 
thing and that goes first and my nose
wasn't<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.040> well<00:03:57.220> covered<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.820> first

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
wasn't that well covered in the first

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.720 
wasn't that well covered in the first
place<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.890> has<00:04:00.070> started<00:04:00.580> like

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
place and but it has started like

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.990 
place and but it has started like
clogging<00:04:01.240> around<00:04:01.600> between<00:04:02.140> my<00:04:02.230> eyebrows<00:04:02.590> and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
clogging around between my eyebrows and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.250 
clogging around between my eyebrows and
so<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.090> doesn't<00:04:04.390> look<00:04:04.510> fantastic<00:04:04.810> especially

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
so it doesn't look fantastic especially

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.750 
so it doesn't look fantastic especially
on<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.740> cheek<00:04:05.980> I'm<00:04:06.130> really<00:04:06.340> not<00:04:06.430> happy<00:04:06.670> with

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
on this cheek I'm really not happy with

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.410 
on this cheek I'm really not happy with
this<00:04:06.910> cheek

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
this cheek

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.720 
this cheek
I<00:04:07.450> wouldn't<00:04:07.870> say<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.470> cuz<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.830> says<00:04:08.980> 16<00:04:09.400> hours

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
I wouldn't say like cuz it says 16 hours

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.480 
I wouldn't say like cuz it says 16 hours
wear<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.240> to<00:04:10.990> be<00:04:11.110> honest<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> doesn't<00:04:12.010> you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
wear and to be honest it doesn't you

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.520 
wear and to be honest it doesn't you
know<00:04:12.610> it's<00:04:12.850> not<00:04:12.970> falling<00:04:13.330> off<00:04:13.540> my<00:04:13.570> face<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:14.320> it

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
know it's not falling off my face but it

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.820 
know it's not falling off my face but it
doesn't<00:04:14.770> look<00:04:14.950> great<00:04:15.130> still<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:15.880> there<00:04:16.120> so

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
doesn't look great still on there so

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.199 
doesn't look great still on there so
overall<00:04:17.830> I'm<00:04:18.130> going<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.400> probably<00:04:18.519> leave<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
overall I'm going to probably leave it

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.640 
overall I'm going to probably leave it
here<00:04:19.359> because<00:04:19.450> I'm<00:04:19.780> gonna<00:04:19.900> take<00:04:20.380> off<00:04:20.560> my

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
here because I'm gonna take off my

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.560 
here because I'm gonna take off my
makeup<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.070> next<00:04:21.310> hour<00:04:21.489> or<00:04:21.519> so<00:04:21.700> so<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.360> don't

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
makeup in the next hour or so so I don't

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.870 
makeup in the next hour or so so I don't
really<00:04:22.840> need<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.350> kind<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.710> update<00:04:24.490> again<00:04:24.700> in

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
really need to kind of update again in

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.760 
really need to kind of update again in
an<00:04:24.940> hour's<00:04:25.240> time

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
an hour's time

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.950 
an hour's time
overall<00:04:26.770> I'd<00:04:27.100> say<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.850> he<00:04:28.060> powdered<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.780> put<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
overall I'd say if he powdered and put a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.440 
overall I'd say if he powdered and put a
primer<00:04:29.500> on<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:30.400> probably<00:04:30.760> would<00:04:30.910> last<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.270> lot

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
primer on it probably would last a lot

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.620 
primer on it probably would last a lot
better<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:32.020> really<00:04:32.560> liked<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.190> Max<00:04:33.370> Factor

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
better I really liked the Max Factor

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.150 
better I really liked the Max Factor
face<00:04:34.630> Finity<00:04:35.050> primer<00:04:35.410> at<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.590> moment<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:35.979> think

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
face Finity primer at the moment I think

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.010 
face Finity primer at the moment I think
that's<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.460> really<00:04:36.729> good<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.750> save

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
that's really really good and so save

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.630 
that's really really good and so save
you<00:04:38.169> had<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.470> underneath<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.400> had

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
you had that underneath and then you had

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.950 
you had that underneath and then you had
like<00:04:39.790> stay<00:04:39.970> matte<00:04:40.120> powder<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.600> top<00:04:40.630> or

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
like stay matte powder on the top or

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.260 
like stay matte powder on the top or
something<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.560> then<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.370> probably<00:04:42.910> worked<00:04:43.120> a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
something and then it probably worked a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.200 
something and then it probably worked a
lot<00:04:43.450> better<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.830> it's<00:04:44.950> not<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.190> horrific<00:04:45.729> like

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
lot better and it's not a horrific like

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.580 
lot better and it's not a horrific like
this<00:04:46.419> cheeks<00:04:46.660> definitely<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.110> lot<00:04:47.350> worse<00:04:47.560> than

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
this cheeks definitely a lot worse than

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.740 
this cheeks definitely a lot worse than
this<00:04:48.070> one<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:49.030> not<00:04:49.210> like<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.540> worst

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
this one and it's not like the worst

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.390 
this one and it's not like the worst
