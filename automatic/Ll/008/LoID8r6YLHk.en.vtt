coming<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.950> along<00:01:41.480> we<00:01:42.480> got<00:01:42.660> something<00:01:43.050> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
coming right along we got something the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
coming right along we got something the
smaller<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> pencil<00:01:45.080> we<00:01:46.080> take<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
smaller than a pencil we take it down to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.390 
smaller than a pencil we take it down to
just<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.850> bud<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.230> like<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.100> it's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
just one bud so like this here it's

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860 
just one bud so like this here it's
bigger<00:01:50.580> than<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.760> pencil<00:01:50.940> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.690> going<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
bigger than a pencil this is going to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.020 
bigger than a pencil this is going to
bear<00:01:52.080> fruit<00:01:52.260> this<00:01:52.500> year<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.760> smaller

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
bear fruit this year but if it's smaller

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
bear fruit this year but if it's smaller
than<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.270> pencil<00:01:54.510> we'll<00:01:55.050> take<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> down<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> one

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
than a pencil we'll take it down to one

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.500 
than a pencil we'll take it down to one
but<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> save<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.910> position<00:01:57.330> because

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
but just to save that position because

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.390 
but just to save that position because
we<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> position<00:01:58.410> because<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.190> four

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
we like the position because it's four

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.040 
we like the position because it's four
fingers<00:01:59.760> from<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.060> point<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:00.840> four

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
fingers from this point and there's four

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.960 
fingers from this point and there's four
fingers<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> good<00:02:02.700> position

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
fingers to here so it's a good position

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.900 
fingers to here so it's a good position
it's<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.660> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.870> bring<00:02:03.990> fruit<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.440> year

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910
