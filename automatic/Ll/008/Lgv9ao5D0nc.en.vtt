by packing labs in my backyard in fact
the<00:00:15.059> kitchen<00:00:15.420> isn't<00:00:15.630> even<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.960> yet<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.740> I've

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the kitchen isn't even in yet but I've

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.779 
the kitchen isn't even in yet but I've
got<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> brand<00:00:17.820> new<00:00:18.060> trifecta<00:00:19.050> machine<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
got the brand new trifecta machine and

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.400 
got the brand new trifecta machine and
this<00:00:20.789> trifecta<00:00:21.180> machine<00:00:21.600> allows<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this trifecta machine allows you to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
this trifecta machine allows you to
program<00:00:22.740> every<00:00:23.160> tiny<00:00:23.460> parameter<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
program every tiny parameter of the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
program every tiny parameter of the
burger<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.830> using<00:00:25.949> technology<00:00:26.550> that's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
burger and we're using technology that's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
burger and we're using technology that's
actually<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.539> bit<00:00:27.689> more<00:00:27.810> precise<00:00:28.140> even

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
actually a little bit more precise even

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
actually a little bit more precise even
than<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.519> new<00:00:29.609> bulletproof<00:00:30.060> coffee

shop but what this lets me do at home is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
shop but what this lets me do at home is
go<00:00:33.989> through<00:00:34.230> our<00:00:34.320> coffee<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.860> test<00:00:35.100> every

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
go through our coffee and test every

go through our coffee and test every
little<00:00:35.790> tweak<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> brewing<00:00:36.719> watch<00:00:37.500> I'm

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
little tweak of the brewing watch I'm

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
little tweak of the brewing watch I'm
going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> hit<00:00:38.309> start<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.910> guy<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.559> what

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
going to hit start on this guy and what

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
going to hit start on this guy and what
it's<00:00:40.710> doing<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.730> telling<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> wait

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it's doing is it's telling me to wait

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's doing is it's telling me to wait
because<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> always<00:00:43.140> wait<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.410> coffee<00:00:43.739> just

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
because you always wait for coffee just

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.150 
because you always wait for coffee just
kidding<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.570> doing<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.160> raising

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
kidding what it's doing is it's raising

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
kidding what it's doing is it's raising
the<00:00:47.219> temperature<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> water<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.390> what's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the temperature of the water but what's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
the temperature of the water but what's
going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> happen<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> put<00:00:49.860> coffee<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.340> here

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
going to happen is I put coffee in here

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
going to happen is I put coffee in here
that<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.180> ground<00:00:51.480> using<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.260> commercial

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that I've ground using a commercial

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
that I've ground using a commercial
grade<00:00:52.980> grinder<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> pre

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
grade grinder and then it's going to pre

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
grade grinder and then it's going to pre
infuse<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> coffee<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> exactly<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> amount

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
infuse the coffee for exactly the amount

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599 
infuse the coffee for exactly the amount
of<00:00:56.969> time<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:58.109> said<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.399> water

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
of time that I said it to do the water

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
of time that I said it to do the water
temperature<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.059> exactly<00:01:00.420> 198<00:01:01.199> degrees<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
temperature is exactly 198 degrees on

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
temperature is exactly 198 degrees on
this<00:01:01.829> batch<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> test<00:01:02.789> 199<00:01:03.629> degrees

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this batch but I can test 199 degrees

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
this batch but I can test 199 degrees
and<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.189> turbulence<00:01:05.820> should

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and I can see how much turbulence should

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
and I can see how much turbulence should
go<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.810> that's<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> water<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
go there because that's the water is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.690 
go there because that's the water is
brewing<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.950> increase<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> pressure<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
brewing we increase the pressure a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.149 
brewing we increase the pressure a
little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> came<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.799> our<00:01:10.890> pre

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
little bit to what I came in was our pre

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.000 
little bit to what I came in was our pre
infusion<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.200> his<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.380> flow<00:01:13.619> counter

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
infusion and his little flow counter

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
infusion and his little flow counter
showing<00:01:14.310> exactly<00:01:15.110> how<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.259> water<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> going

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
always do it the same way each time but

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969

here<00:01:33.390> we've<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.409> little

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here we've got you can see little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
here we've got you can see little
bubbles<00:01:34.799> coming<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> water<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
bubbles coming up to the water this is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
bubbles coming up to the water this is
like<00:01:36.479> stirring<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> French<00:01:37.259> press<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
like stirring a French press but I can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
like stirring a French press but I can
test<00:01:38.820> something<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.450> exactly<00:01:39.900> what

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
test something to see exactly what

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
test something to see exactly what
happens<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.759> apples<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.299> apples<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
happens and I can do apples to apples to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
happens and I can do apples to apples to
apples<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.829> remove<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
apples so that we remove that that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.789 
apples so that we remove that that
question<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.439> brewed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
question about was it how it was brewed

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
question about was it how it was brewed
no<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.579> brew<00:01:47.759> something<00:01:48.090> perfectly

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
no I can brew something perfectly

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.860 
no I can brew something perfectly
consistently<00:01:49.320> every<00:01:49.470> time

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
consistently every time

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.870 
consistently every time
forever<00:01:50.170> using<00:01:51.040> this<00:01:51.160> kind<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.460> tech<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
forever using this kind of tech and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
forever using this kind of tech and
that's<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.270> sort<00:01:52.480> of<00:01:52.510> thing<00:01:52.660> that<00:01:52.690> we're

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
that's the sort of thing that we're

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.350 
that's the sort of thing that we're
doing<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.440> book<00:01:53.590> your<00:01:53.740> coffee<00:01:53.950> shop

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
doing in the book your coffee shop

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:04.170 
doing in the book your coffee shop
everything<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.630> quantified<00:01:56.080> I<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> do

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
everything is quantified I like to do

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180 
everything is quantified I like to do
not<00:02:04.360> open<00:02:04.780> part<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.350> where<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.770> tells<00:02:06.040> you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
not open part of it where it tells you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.830 
not open part of it where it tells you
not<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.370> spray<00:02:07.150> hot<00:02:07.330> coffee<00:02:07.600> all<00:02:07.810> over

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
not to spray hot coffee all over

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.630 
not to spray hot coffee all over
yourself<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.400> pressing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
yourself so this is just like pressing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.000 
yourself so this is just like pressing
the<00:02:15.850> plunger<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> French<00:02:16.630> press<00:02:17.010> except

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the plunger on a French press except

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.160 
the plunger on a French press except
it's<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.420> also<00:02:19.660> through<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> metal

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
it's going to also through a metal

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's going to also through a metal
filter<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.740> using<00:02:21.040> air<00:02:21.310> pressure<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.730> do

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
filter but it's using air pressure to do

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.790 
filter but it's using air pressure to do
that<00:02:22.090> which<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.690> neat<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.770> can

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that which is kind of neat you can

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.980 
that which is kind of neat you can
actually<00:02:27.150> outperform<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.210> pour-over<00:02:28.480> every

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
actually outperform a pour-over every

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.300 
actually outperform a pour-over every
single<00:02:29.290> time<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.740> something<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.130> this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
single time with something like this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.520 
single time with something like this
because<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.700> poor<00:02:30.970> over<00:02:31.180> how<00:02:31.600> slowly<00:02:32.050> did<00:02:32.410> you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
because of poor over how slowly did you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.900 
because of poor over how slowly did you
pour<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.860> coffee<00:02:33.040> even<00:02:33.340> though<00:02:33.520> there's<00:02:33.700> an

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
pour the coffee even though there's an

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.180 
pour the coffee even though there's an
art<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.390> fun<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.710> level<00:02:35.950> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
art and a fun to that this level of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.550 
art and a fun to that this level of
precision<00:02:36.460> lets<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.570> take<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.080> art<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
precision lets you take the art of a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.780 
precision lets you take the art of a
perfect<00:02:38.860> cup<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.070> coffee<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.460> make<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.670> sweet

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
perfect cup of coffee to make it sweet

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.390 
perfect cup of coffee to make it sweet
then<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.690> repeat<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.290> whatever<00:02:42.190> here

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
then you can repeat it and whatever here

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.490 
then you can repeat it and whatever here
is<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.730> perfect<00:02:43.180> cup<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.390> coffee<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.840> hope<00:02:44.020> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.450 

think<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.560> should<00:02:47.680> raise<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.860> temperature<00:02:48.340> by

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
think we should raise the temperature by

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.840 
think we should raise the temperature by
one<00:02:48.670> degree<00:02:48.700> maybe<00:02:50.220> let's<00:02:51.220> play<00:02:51.460> with<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
one degree maybe let's play with that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.960 
one degree maybe let's play with that
have<00:02:52.750> an<00:02:52.840> awesome<00:02:53.110> day

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
have an awesome day

next up gonna do this amazing thing

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.610 
next up gonna do this amazing thing
called<00:02:57.550> stir<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.720> toons<00:02:59.110> I'm<00:02:59.230> breaking<00:02:59.530> the

called stir it so toons I'm breaking the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.330 
called stir it so toons I'm breaking the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
crust that forms and you could call this

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.949 
crust that forms and you could call this
reverse<00:03:03.340> french<00:03:03.670> press<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:04.570> people<00:03:04.810> call<00:03:04.930> it

cowboy coffee
I<00:03:06.580> call<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.810> immersion<00:03:08.170> coffee<00:03:08.709> sometimes

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
I call it the immersion coffee sometimes

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.600 
I call it the immersion coffee sometimes
like<00:03:09.760> there's<00:03:09.970> different<00:03:10.360> ways<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.690> doing<00:03:10.840> it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.430 

see<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> head<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.970> foam<00:03:19.150> that's<00:03:19.720> formed<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.320> it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
see the head of foam that's formed on it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.960 
see the head of foam that's formed on it
this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.739> similar<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.550> get<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:21.940> a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
this is similar to what you get with a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
this is similar to what you get with a
latte<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:23.170> are<00:03:23.260> actually<00:03:23.530> little<00:03:23.709> bubbles

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
latte there are actually little bubbles

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.729 
latte there are actually little bubbles
still<00:03:24.730> coming<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.510> surface<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.380> a

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
still coming to the surface just like a

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.030 
still coming to the surface just like a
freshly<00:03:27.100> steamed<00:03:27.610> latte
