00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.119
 hi everyone this notice so 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.490
 I hope you are well 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 today I will start over again I 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 am going to do a little bit at all so I 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.590
 repeat my series of everything a little 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.140
 people in his days you will see 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.669
 tutorials especially on ssd is so the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.079
 mainly also on pc 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.050
 portable so that will be the subject of a 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.559
 second video coming out of here two 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 or three days 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.610
 so today it's going to be like the name 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 the indicated how to boost 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 considerably his laptop or his 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.320
 fixed pc it works also very very well 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.540
 so the answer is the sp quoted then 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.290
 you have to know something is that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.850
 ssd for me i have this is the only true 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.149
 components that we can change that will 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.970
 really boosting explicitly 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.350
 your down so I explain myself when 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.030
 we change our soul or when we change 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.829
 our processor etc 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.880
 good already it's not the same couple 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.610
 processor but when we change our 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.430
 soul for example we will not really see 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 the difference from a direct point of view 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.130
 I do not know if you understand but in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 big we will see the difference really 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.729
 when we are going to start doing a little 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.659
 little multitasking or found at 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.749
 encode videos etc 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.240
 but really the csd you will put 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.340
 insisted you will install windows 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 above some games on it you go 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.389
 see immediately the difference 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.270
 why because the csdc of the snapshot 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.779
 that is to say that you will launch a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.779
 program 

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:38.189
 it will run instantly and that's it 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.689
 not like not filled hard drive 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.479
 times when one has to wait for one's load 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.950
 and try and not on behalf ssd is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.189
 also very well known for all that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 is the quick start so for the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.920
 startup is fast good for you in 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 realize a little bit I found 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.639
 a pretty awesome test on on 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 internet so you'll see there is the 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.069
 AIDS right and the normal hard drive to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.039
 left 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.899
 you will see that it is at the level of 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.399
 boot and I will tell you something 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 after that is even more impressive 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.569
 so there you will see that that of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.849
 right going boot in 36 seconds 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.470
 so that's it so see that page 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.330
 welcome we hardly see it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 while the one left left right they 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.970
 still arrive thirty seconds later 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.470
 late but you'll tell me here we are 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.890
 not at 30 seconds ready it's yes 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.030
 ok but the csd is fine 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.800
 for startup but as I tell you 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 just say before it's also very very 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.250
 good for everything in the games 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.610
 all the loads and so it's 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.380
 a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.110
 it's very fast so the access time 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.210
 is quite reduced the tower access to the disk 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.560
 hard when you 're going to copy 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.140
 paste it's going to be very, very fast 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.590
 then very important things to note 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 is that the hard drive is finally mentioned 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.810
 let them get degraded very 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.370
 very slow in quotation marks months for 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.030
 for info my essay already bought there is a 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.270
 year and a half and it's a bone and z agility 3 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.740
 2240 jk I explained myself after and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.370
 frankly the first day that I have 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.510
 bought that the performances have 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.610
 practically not changed 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.380
 that's the opposite of the times we can 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.209
 africa buy a card that I not to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.530
 after two years a year and a half she 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.890
 begins to lose little of his 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.500
 power 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.300
 honestly the my hard drive ssd i 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 see hardly the difference 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.600
 that is, in two years I have 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 virtually no loss of performance 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.690
 what is it not just if I took a 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.450
 good brand or not I wanted especially 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.610
 a big 1.6 and since I was on 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.880
 laptop pc I needed it 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.830
 Obviously a bad saw with only one 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.950
 lot of books I needed 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.420
 fines a big hard drive so 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.730
 now we will go into a part 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.790
 quite complicated so how well 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.100
 choose his assist and therefore the seizures 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.440
 savall of course depend on the of the 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.350
 cut 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.910
 of your main hard drive so here is 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.720
 if like me you do not have a record 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.070
 main hard 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.960
 finally another main hard drive 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.240
 especially in laptops if you 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.690
 have 15 fleet available so a catch 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.880
 eSATA 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.250
 it will of course have to you a disc 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.490
 hard it was pretty big enough unless 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.510
 use this tale that I will this 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.790
 that I will say in a next 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.800
 video what's called layrac slim or 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.830
 if he wanted to give away pitches for 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.450
 hard drives that are placed instead 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.760
 from our cd player so I'm going to you 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.940
 it's about facts and that 's okay 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.080
 really be the focus of a video that goes 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.510
 go out very very quickly 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.100
 so here I bought it myself so this 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.810
 that there is that it is a year a 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.610
 location like that that we put at the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.140
 place our cd player and we can 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 put a ssd inside so that 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.290
 it's very very very powerful 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.910
 so I will be the subject of a video 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.220
 it will be the subject of a very 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.450
 how soon is chosen 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.350
 so our site is of course compared 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.570
 to the capacity 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.580
 so if you want a lot of giga or 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.169
 I do not recommend between 120 gigas I 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.280
 think the 120 gigas is fine 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.680
 so we can put windows 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.550
 we can put some applications 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.410
 above like some games and so it's 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.720
 after that it's up to you to see me I like 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.720
 well the kingston the kingston are 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.330
 pretty good 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.569
 after I also love the series 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:18.229
 samsung and I have in myself 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.770
 this is hyperx so here we take the 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.979
 kingston 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.539
 if this test now now sorry so what 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.020
 is important this is especially so they 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.490
 test the write transfer rate 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.669
 and in reading so here we see that his 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.580
 480 write against 535 read 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.809
 so it was very good 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.779
 for example if we go down further in the 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:43.189
 samsung range so here we see that it's 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.330
 530 read that 390 write but 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.379
 after of course there's not that like 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.719
 parameter to take into account 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.539
 Of course, there is also the max of operations 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.930
 at the second finally the second or not 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.039
 it is related to ps forgiveness so here after 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.069
 it's up to you to compare a little bit 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.539
 all this so I hope you're here 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.509
 try to take a little bit according to 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.659
 your budget according to your abilities so 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.789
 120 gigabytes 200 gigawatts 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.569
 then do not forget that I will do 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.119
 another video 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.819
 so to explain to you that we can 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:15.559
 put a ssd hard drive without deleting 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.379
 his first hard drive in pc 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.699
 portable very important and so here 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.259
 so I 'm going to put that link too so 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.580
 I fell on it yesterday it's for 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.979
 clone his hard drive because yes 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.050
 when we put a hard drive attend 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.339
 we want windows is disappointed we want that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.199
 all this question and on without 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.490
 we need to format 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.509
 so here is a tool called 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.110
 easy use to back hamlet at home pardon 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.439
 so he does it very well so you 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.479
 it 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.610
 clown and your main hard drive on 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.649
 your hard drive ssd it's very very 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.869
 practice so here is another link in 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:49.279
 Video So here even explained 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:52.490
 how do you show it and that's so it's 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:55.639
 really a great link that I you 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.869
 recommend so here is a little 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.849
 recapitulative so the is seized it's 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.990
 very well because that's what we're going 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.680
 see we will see directly the 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.110
 performance very explicitly afterwards 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.089
 the ssd how to choose and then 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.680
 how all that is how the clown 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:13.339
 and how to put windows on etc 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.599
 Here it was quite a long video 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:16.610
 it's a little bit complicated maybe 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.180
 for you thank you for having me 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.069
 listening 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.209
 so we're going to say ciao bye to the 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.209
 next and carry your winnings
