and SIM card slots and that's cool but

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.820 
and SIM card slots and that's cool but
I've<00:03:00.670> personally<00:03:01.030> found<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.599> for<00:03:01.900> me<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.440> g4

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
I've personally found that for me the g4

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.979 
I've personally found that for me the g4
is<00:03:02.920> pretty<00:03:03.280> slippery<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> hand<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.630> fact

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
is pretty slippery in the hand in fact

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.839 
is pretty slippery in the hand in fact
I've<00:03:05.470> dropped<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.980> several<00:03:06.310> times<00:03:06.610> now

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
I've dropped it several times now

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.059 
I've dropped it several times now
because<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:08.200> what's<00:03:08.349> awesome<00:03:08.530> is

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
because of that but what's awesome is

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.009 
because of that but what's awesome is
that<00:03:09.370> even<00:03:09.849> though<00:03:09.940> I've<00:03:10.060> dropped<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.630> there's

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
that even though I've dropped it there's

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.259 
that even though I've dropped it there's
been<00:03:11.140> literally<00:03:11.769> no<00:03:12.190> damage<00:03:12.670> caused<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
been literally no damage caused and

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.090 
been literally no damage caused and
that's<00:03:13.630> with<00:03:13.840> me<00:03:14.019> dropping<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.530> from<00:03:14.650> chest

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
that's with me dropping it from chest

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.430 
that's with me dropping it from chest
height<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.850> hardwood<00:03:16.329> floor<00:03:16.660> several<00:03:17.170> times

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
height to hardwood floor several times

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.860 
height to hardwood floor several times
so<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.489> guess<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> durability<00:03:19.239> gets<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.660> thumbs

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
so I guess the durability gets a thumbs

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720 
so I guess the durability gets a thumbs
up<00:03:20.170> volume<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.709> power<00:03:20.859> buttons<00:03:21.280> being<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
up volume and power buttons being on the

okay<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.459> now<00:03:51.700> let's<00:03:51.910> talk<00:03:52.030> battery<00:03:52.450> life<00:03:52.630> well

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
okay so now let's talk battery life well

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.780 
okay so now let's talk battery life well
as<00:03:53.079> many<00:03:53.500> other<00:03:53.739> reviewers<00:03:54.130> mentioned

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
as many other reviewers mentioned

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.879 
as many other reviewers mentioned
standby<00:03:55.389> time<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.959> awesome<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.530> think<00:03:56.560> I've

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
standby time is awesome I think I've

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.770 
standby time is awesome I think I've
been<00:03:57.040> averaging<00:03:57.220> like<00:03:57.639> maybe<00:03:57.910> two<00:03:58.450> percent

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
been averaging like maybe two percent

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.720 
been averaging like maybe two percent
drainage<00:03:59.380> for<00:03:59.530> every<00:03:59.739> four<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.040> five<00:04:00.220> hours<00:04:00.579> or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
drainage for every four to five hours or

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.580 
drainage for every four to five hours or
so<00:04:00.910> which<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.690> pretty<00:04:01.900> much<00:04:02.079> right<00:04:02.319> what<00:04:02.500> we

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
so which is pretty much right what we

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.650 
so which is pretty much right what we
like<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:02.980> but<00:04:03.250> obviously<00:04:03.609> screen<00:04:04.000> on<00:04:04.180> time<00:04:04.450> is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
like it but obviously screen on time is

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.120 
like it but obviously screen on time is
really<00:04:04.989> what<00:04:05.170> we're<00:04:05.319> more<00:04:05.470> interested<00:04:05.799> in

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
really what we're more interested in

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.190 
really what we're more interested in
here<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.209> able<00:04:07.329> to<00:04:07.480> reach<00:04:07.660> four<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.170> a

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
here and I was able to reach four and a

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.470 
here and I was able to reach four and a
half<00:04:08.230> hours<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.920> screen<00:04:09.160> on<00:04:09.190> time<00:04:09.340> from<00:04:09.790> one

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
half hours of screen on time from one

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.960 
half hours of screen on time from one
percent<00:04:10.810> battery<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.319> about<00:04:11.500> 13%<00:04:12.250> now

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
percent battery to about 13% now

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.670 
percent battery to about 13% now
everyone<00:04:13.390> uses<00:04:13.720> their<00:04:13.870> phones<00:04:14.110> differently

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
everyone uses their phones differently

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.949 
everyone uses their phones differently
so<00:04:14.980> some<00:04:15.519> might<00:04:15.819> find<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.359> they'll<00:04:16.510> get<00:04:16.660> even

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
so some might find that they'll get even

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.140 
so some might find that they'll get even
more<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.680> four<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.280> half<00:04:18.310> hours<00:04:18.910> is

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
more but four and a half hours is

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.210 
more but four and a half hours is
nothing<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.780> complain<00:04:20.049> about<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.889> also

more<00:05:50.350> than<00:05:50.500> one<00:05:50.680> occasion<00:05:50.950> so<00:05:51.310> I<00:05:51.340> thought<00:05:51.639> it

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
more than one occasion so I thought it

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.879 
more than one occasion so I thought it
worth<00:05:51.910> mentioning<00:05:52.450> but<00:05:52.870> general<00:05:53.410> performance

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
worth mentioning but general performance

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.250 
worth mentioning but general performance
has<00:05:54.039> been<00:05:54.070> great<00:05:54.700> playing<00:05:55.300> games<00:05:55.690> is<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.930> breeze

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
has been great playing games is a breeze

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.960 
has been great playing games is a breeze
and<00:05:56.500> it<00:05:56.590> looks<00:05:56.800> awesome<00:05:57.340> on<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.460> quad<00:05:57.820> HD

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
and it looks awesome on that quad HD

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.690 
and it looks awesome on that quad HD
display<00:05:58.289> there's<00:05:59.289> also<00:05:59.470> been<00:05:59.680> no<00:05:59.979> frame<00:06:00.430> loss

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
display there's also been no frame loss

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.490

or<00:06:00.970> noticeable<00:06:01.570> stuttering<00:06:01.870> for<00:06:02.169> me<00:06:02.320> either

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
or noticeable stuttering for me either

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.159

so<00:06:02.979> other<00:06:03.700> than<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:03.910> odd<00:06:04.090> hang-up<00:06:04.630> I'd<00:06:04.930> give

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
so other than the odd hang-up I'd give

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.320 
so other than the odd hang-up I'd give
performance<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.800> thumbs<00:06:06.039> up<00:06:06.220> too<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:06.700> finally

a case would solve half that problem and
