00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 goat 01 today as part of the detailed 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.250
 analysis, we will analyze the ult me ​​to 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.600
 ripper skyys casting radius ults on all 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 levels is 600 units 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 damage from the cash register is applied strictly after 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 Mills and a half seconds from Ultimate 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.870
 impossible to dodge by moving 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.870
 in space at any distance 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.370
 damage can be avoided thanks to the ally 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.370
 astral 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 or using and st and karabakh 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.760
 nyx blocks damage 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.590
 bkb will block damage but I won't 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.650
 if you find the right timing you can 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.910
 go to bkb a second and a half before 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.750
 graduation 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.750
 this skill doesn't have that much 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.990
 features all its salt is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.850
 calculating the damage in order to bring in 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.970
 dota element of surprise and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.070
 the impossibility of calculating the cold frog 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.610
 greatly complicated the action and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.649
 description of the ability we will analyze all 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.899
 on the shelves 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.770
 with the help of our beloved elementary 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.560
 math 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.240
 it is easy to understand that the damage is done 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 percent on subject to magical protection in 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.130
 this table you can see items 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.819
 which can be combined for 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.459
 causing maximum damage as well 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.319
 the percentage of the health of the enemy that is needed 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.780
 to destroy it 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:03.970
 always try to navigate 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.970
 visually oh and bor 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.510
 the only negative is the table is not 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.320
 good if the enemy began to swing 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.070
 plus signs 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.060
 either packs hoodov defence magical 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870
 protection grows but do not lose heart with you dota 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.600
 2 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.310
 and we will find a way out of this situation is 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.430
 automatic damage calculation table 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 by entering data similar to 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.430
 which was on the screen detailed calculations 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.710
 can be seen up there 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.590
 very interesting statistics which 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.410
 can be used while playing for 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.680
 ensure that everything works correctly for you 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 you need to enter three values ​​how much 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 hp of the enemy is indicative of hp 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.060
 adversary before hitting the spit and his 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.820
 magic resistance 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.330
 Suppose we have a deep raid 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:07.130
 Opponent only three thousand 700 hp he 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.230
 left and a half and magical protection 40 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.630
 we have this real aganim and ulta 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.730
 maximum level with such 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 With the parameters we deal 2640 damage slightly 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.790
 below you can see more interesting 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.190
 the numbers are the number of hp which 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.190
 must stay with the enemy for you 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 could kill him for one his ultimate 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.940
 depending on magical protection 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.940
 health percentage in the bottom table 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 is changing 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.900
