00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello and welcome to all and antoine 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.720
 today in this new video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.740
 pong blog 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.740
 we will talk a little bit about 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.990
 installing a hard drive and slt 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.990
 in a macbook pro go it's gone 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.190
 get married that it's powerful 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.690
 that's first of all in a 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 first step that will take davis and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.700
 levis behind your pro macbook 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 so there are exactly 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.059
 10 vi unscrewed 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 so once you have all the vices 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 and you remove the plate 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.199
 So here is once the plate remove 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.670
 you can notice your disk ssd 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.729
 which is at the bottom left 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.300
 the superdrive at the top next we have the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.040
 card but nothing sound to the battery 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 then there is the thing to do everything from 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.350
 continued if you still have not installed 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.770
 your ssd is disassemble two small 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.750
 screws that hold the hard drive so from 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.660
 very small screws it's easy that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.430
 hold the block sign and then you 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.800
 you can remove your hard drive 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.450
 ssd without forgetting end we go your records 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.450
 hard not to forget to remove the tablecloth 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 so here 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.200
 see that we have our little b who comes in 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.200
 very well in the part of the superbike 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.490
 so for the installation of the hard drive 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.450
 in loppsi b it will have to install a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.860
 ben dirtyh disassemble the vices that binds to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 kylie has all around the three vices that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.340
 there are who make hold your little b to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 unless you want small casca 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.020
 black part plastic way but he 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 will have to dismount after but I have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 disassembled all the screws it was more 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.460
 clean so you can install the drive 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460
 hard inside 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.599
 that's when the screws are 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 disassembled you'll have to do it 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.620
 wipe your hard drive in till 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.840
 what does it make in sata connectors 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.629
 or just do not see each other anymore 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.909
 far that this is once it's 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.980
 well returned you the vice and you 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.569
 return your tibet you aim the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.909
 four vices that are provided with the 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.510
 kit so to be able to maintain well 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.510
 your hard drive 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.920
 once you've done these four 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:37.670
 vices you put back the metal part 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.659
 in aluminum at the top and you put 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.739
 the three buses that were dismounted at 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.739
 prior to any age 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.020
 so then we'll go to 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.849
 the installation on the super bright it 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.280
 just remove the tablecloths is attacking 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.840
 first of the hard drive so you put 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.830
 your moment of lifting the little ones 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.830
 small tablecloth is disassembled 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.810
 and you take away all lives what he 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.110
 are around the SuperDrive 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.169
 so there is one two three four five 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.360
 lives it shows so you go there with 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.759
 the blond tram reviews since markup 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.139
 strikers slammed watch in hand and 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 in principle it comes well must 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.479
 based on vices a very lewd concern 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.110
 very flat and therefore global and although 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.110
 the good times the vice 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.280
 so once you have it all off 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.600
 you can take apart the tablecloth of your 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.820
 superb rhein like the hard drive 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.620
 and drag it by doing very 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.210
 pay attention to the guarantee label so 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.570
 not to lose a guarantee if it is 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.570
 still under warranty 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.720
 that's it now that you have 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.900
 all removed we will go to 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.820
 the installation so due the opib is 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:47.139
 so we first get a little 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.729
 part a small part of the kif and the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.010
 connectors between sata connectors and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.360
 sata connectors from the macbook pro 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.950
 so that you take it off your super 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.370
 bright so you give it your little 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:01.139

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.169
 fan 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.120
