problems today but let's watch it better
balance<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:19.230> bit<00:00:19.350> better<00:00:19.529> timing<00:00:19.859> now

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
balance a little bit better timing now

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
balance a little bit better timing now
so<00:00:20.369> we've<00:00:20.520> done<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> few<00:00:21.150> tricks<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.109> our

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
so we've done a few tricks with our

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
so we've done a few tricks with our
setup<00:00:22.500> trying<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> make<00:00:23.010> things<00:00:23.189> better<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
setup trying to make things better and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
setup trying to make things better and
it's<00:00:23.670> starting<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> starting<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> show<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.199> did

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
it's starting to starting to show we did

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
it's starting to starting to show we did
some<00:00:25.529> drills<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.039> helped<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.670> too

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
some drills it helped a little bit too

some drills it helped a little bit too
these<00:00:27.750> things<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> work

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
these things are all going to work

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
these things are all going to work
together<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.980> build<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.460> skills<00:00:29.760> we're

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
together to build the skills we're

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.610 
together to build the skills we're
looking<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> look<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.260> look<00:00:34.350> better

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
now with more balance and still good

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.350 
now with more balance and still good
ball<00:00:37.110> motion<00:00:37.530> still<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.100> revs<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> rotation

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
ball motion still good revs and rotation

frame you want to move the ball on the
foot<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> same<00:01:09.180> time<00:01:10.790> which<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:12.090> are

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
foot at the same time which they are

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
foot at the same time which they are
right<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.619> we're<00:01:13.740> much

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
right there and we're now see we're much

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
right there and we're now see we're much
closer<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> having<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> ball<00:01:14.700> down<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.030> knee

closer to having the ball down at knee

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.140 
closer to having the ball down at knee
high<00:01:15.360> long<00:01:16.320> before<00:01:16.710> step<00:01:16.979> two<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.610> process

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
high long before step two is in process

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
high long before step two is in process
right<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.920> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.070> hand<00:01:20.250> position

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
right and look at that hand position

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.039 
right and look at that hand position

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.910 
in a minute too at the finish pretty
close<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> high<00:01:30.750> level<00:01:31.049> release<00:01:32.810> okay<00:01:33.920> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
close to that high level release okay so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.109 
close to that high level release okay so
let's<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> look<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> release<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
let's take a look at the release now a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.999 
let's take a look at the release now a
little<00:01:36.299> closer<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.470> video<00:01:37.680> view

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.240 

here<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.280> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> swing<00:01:45.740> great<00:01:46.740> position

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
here we go into the swing great position

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
here we go into the swing great position
right<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.430> index<00:01:47.970> finger<00:01:48.270> pointed<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.780> to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
but that's kind of unloading the elbow

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.120 
but that's kind of unloading the elbow
and<00:03:21.329> then<00:03:21.989> unloading<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> wrist<00:03:22.680> at<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.890> same

time or one after the other and again a
little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.650> lifting<00:03:29.130> up<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.790> as

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
putting it right down into the lane

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630 
putting it right down into the lane
which<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.170> practiced<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.130> little<00:03:35.250> bit<00:03:35.459> today

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
which we practiced a little bit today

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.289 
which we practiced a little bit today
which<00:03:36.480> gives<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.870> actually<00:03:37.350> gives<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.650> more

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
which gives you actually gives you more

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:47.300 
which gives you actually gives you more
rather<00:03:39.299> than<00:03:39.420> less<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:40.170> do<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:46.310> but

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
rather than less to do that okay but

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
rather than less to do that okay but
that's<00:03:47.430> pretty<00:03:47.700> close<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.299> that's<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.600> pretty

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that's pretty close so that's a pretty

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.710 
that's pretty close so that's a pretty
good<00:03:48.840> release<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.790> you've<00:03:51.030> got<00:03:51.209> going<00:03:51.450> there

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
good release that you've got going there

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.410 
good release that you've got going there
just<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.440> less<00:03:52.799> lifting<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.400> roll<00:03:54.390> it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
just a little less lifting up roll it

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.360 
just a little less lifting up roll it
down<00:03:54.690> into<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> lane<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.500> you'll<00:03:55.950> find<00:03:56.220> it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
down into the lane and you'll find it's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.920 
down into the lane and you'll find it's
going<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.549> be<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.239> what<00:03:57.480> he's<00:03:57.630> throwing

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
going to be more like what he's throwing

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.030 
going to be more like what he's throwing
over<00:03:58.200> here<00:03:58.350> on<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> right<00:03:58.650> side<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.980> the

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
you develop that but you're nicely right

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.610 
you develop that but you're nicely right
over<00:04:06.090> them<00:04:06.269> you're<00:04:06.840> touching<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.230> pant<00:04:07.410> leg

really<00:04:09.120> good<00:04:09.299> close<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> ankle

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
really good close to the ankle

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.710

nice<00:04:10.920> tilt<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.090> see<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.359> upper<00:04:12.540> body

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
nice tilt you can see the upper body

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.370 
nice tilt you can see the upper body
tilt<00:04:13.019> very<00:04:13.799> very<00:04:14.190> similar<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.790> Shawn's<00:04:15.380> torso

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
tilt very very similar to Shawn's torso

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.310 
tilt very very similar to Shawn's torso
right<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.039> angles<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.320> space

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
right here the angles and the space

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.979 
right here the angles and the space
between<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.859> arm<00:04:20.039> and<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> body<00:04:20.720> very<00:04:21.720> close

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
between the arm and the body very close

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.210 
between the arm and the body very close
to<00:04:22.109> Shawn's<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.500> fact<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.680> like<00:04:22.830> yours<00:04:23.099> even

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
better you've got less space I think

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.219 
better you've got less space I think
between<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.130> body<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.050> shoulder<00:04:28.050> than

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
the ball a little more when you're back

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.990

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
the index finger more in the center of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.200 
the index finger more in the center of
the<00:04:49.409> ball<00:04:49.590> now<00:04:50.130> one<00:04:50.340> thing<00:04:50.460> about<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.849> is<00:04:50.970> I

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
the ball now one thing about it is I

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.670 
the ball now one thing about it is I
noticed<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:51.960> when<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.169> was<00:04:52.260> working<00:04:52.320> with<00:04:52.620> you

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
noticed this when I was working with you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.589 
noticed this when I was working with you
before<00:04:52.950> your<00:04:53.370> wrist<00:04:53.729> does<00:04:54.090> not<00:04:54.270> want<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.450> turn

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
before your wrist does not want to turn

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.990 
before your wrist does not want to turn
much<00:04:54.870> fat<00:04:55.200> past<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:55.979> that's<00:04:56.520> one<00:04:56.729> reason

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
much fat past that so that's one reason

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.399 
much fat past that so that's one reason
you<00:04:57.030> can't<00:04:57.330> maybe<00:04:57.570> get<00:04:57.870> where<00:04:58.050> he's<00:04:58.200> at

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
you can't maybe get where he's at

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.659 
you can't maybe get where he's at
because<00:04:58.590> your<00:04:58.830> body<00:04:59.039> just<00:04:59.310> doesn't<00:04:59.520> want<00:04:59.640> to

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
because your body just doesn't want to

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.940 
because your body just doesn't want to
go<00:04:59.820> there<00:05:00.060> okay<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.930> it's<00:05:01.110> not<00:05:01.169> going<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.470> go<00:05:01.590> so

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
go there okay so it's not going to go so

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710 
go there okay so it's not going to go so
I<00:05:02.010> can<00:05:02.039> go<00:05:02.310> way<00:05:02.460> over<00:05:02.640> here<00:05:02.940> but<00:05:03.419> that's<00:05:03.570> not

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
I can go way over here but that's not

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.630 
I can go way over here but that's not
going<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.050> happen<00:05:04.229> with<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.400> that's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
going to happen with you so that's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.740 
going to happen with you so that's
probably<00:05:05.880> why<00:05:06.120> you're<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:06.419> this<00:05:06.539> position

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
probably why you're in this position

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.290 
probably why you're in this position
here<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:07.440> that's<00:05:07.770> okay<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.909> work<00:05:09.090> within

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
here and that's okay just work within

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.210 
here and that's okay just work within
your<00:05:09.450> own<00:05:09.510> limitations<00:05:09.960> your<00:05:10.349> own<00:05:10.470> body<00:05:10.740> what

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
your own limitations your own body what

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.200 
your own limitations your own body what
it<00:05:11.310> wants<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.610> do<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:11.789> what<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:11.970> doesn't<00:05:12.120> want

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
it wants to do and what it doesn't want

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.330 
it wants to do and what it doesn't want
to<00:05:12.330> do<00:05:12.450> you<00:05:12.570> don't<00:05:12.750> hurt<00:05:12.900> yourself

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
to do you don't hurt yourself

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.790 
to do you don't hurt yourself
but<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.360> would<00:05:15.539> just<00:05:15.570> let<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:15.930> be<00:05:16.110> relaxed<00:05:16.680> at

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
but I would just let this be relaxed at

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.589 
but I would just let this be relaxed at
the<00:05:16.830> finish<00:05:17.159> that's<00:05:17.400> really<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.820> have<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
the finish that's really I have to

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.600 
the finish that's really I have to
finish<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:19.110> wrist<00:05:19.710> should<00:05:19.860> be<00:05:19.979> flexible<00:05:20.460> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
finish the wrist should be flexible and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.779 
finish the wrist should be flexible and
just<00:05:20.909> let<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.150> unload<00:05:21.570> unlatch<00:05:22.700> instead<00:05:23.700> of

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
just let it unload unlatch instead of

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.159 
just let it unload unlatch instead of
trying<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.090> tighten<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.539> up<00:05:24.599> at<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.870> finish

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
trying to tighten it up at the finish

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.469 
trying to tighten it up at the finish
loosen<00:05:26.159> it<00:05:26.280> at<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.520> finish<00:05:26.729> just<00:05:27.090> be<00:05:27.240> loose

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
loosen it at the finish just be loose

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.960 
loosen it at the finish just be loose
and<00:05:27.690> come<00:05:28.349> free<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:29.130> that'll<00:05:29.310> be<00:05:29.400> one<00:05:29.789> way<00:05:29.940> to

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
and come free and that'll be one way to

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.279 
and come free and that'll be one way to
help<00:05:30.240> learn<00:05:30.419> this<00:05:30.570> because<00:05:30.659> it's<00:05:31.050> really

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
help learn this because it's really

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.529 
help learn this because it's really
happens<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.830> millisecond<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:33.330> best

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
happens in a millisecond and the best

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.820 
happens in a millisecond and the best
way<00:05:33.659> to<00:05:33.690> learn<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.930> just<00:05:33.960> don't<00:05:34.289> let<00:05:34.409> it<00:05:34.470> let<00:05:34.770> it

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
way to learn it just don't let it let it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.860 
way to learn it just don't let it let it
go<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.849> I'm<00:05:35.909> going<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> let<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.510> ball<00:05:36.659> off<00:05:36.750> my

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
go so I'm going to let the ball off my

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.540 
go so I'm going to let the ball off my
hand<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.260> not<00:05:37.860> going<00:05:38.039> to<00:05:38.130> try<00:05:38.219> to<00:05:38.280> think

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
hand and not going to try to think

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.760 
hand and not going to try to think
through<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:39.000> because<00:05:39.330> it's<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:40.440> happens

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
through it because it's just it happens

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.680
