00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.000 
then we're going to look at my downloads
and<00:03:19.000> there<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.420> right<00:03:20.599> there<00:03:21.010> that's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and there you see it right there that's

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.940 
and there you see it right there that's
the<00:03:22.189> one<00:03:24.010> you're<00:03:25.010> going<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.189> open<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.579> up<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
the one you're going to open it up and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.160 
the one you're going to open it up and
click<00:03:28.250> OK<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.819> important<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:32.989> because

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
click OK and it is important now because

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.410 
click OK and it is important now because
there<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:34.010> mappings<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.819> have<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.090> do<00:03:35.209> with<00:03:35.329> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
there is mappings I have to do with the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.300 
there is mappings I have to do with the
effects<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:36.019> tractors<00:03:36.620> funny<00:03:36.890> like<00:03:37.099> that

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
effects it tractors funny like that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.000 
effects it tractors funny like that
every<00:03:38.090> time<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.780> need<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.049> do<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
every time you need to do some of the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.940 
every time you need to do some of the
effects<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.370> need<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.640> import<00:03:41.470> your<00:03:42.470> map<00:03:42.709> in

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
effects you need to import your map in

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.580 
effects you need to import your map in
place<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.430> hit<00:03:43.579> import<00:03:44.090> again<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.319> reason

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
place so hit import again and the reason

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.869 
place so hit import again and the reason
it<00:03:51.650> takes<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.950> little<00:03:52.099> bit<00:03:52.220> long<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.670> this

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
it takes a little bit long like this

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.759 
it takes a little bit long like this
this<00:03:53.150> map<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.750> there's<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.930> lot<00:03:54.169> of<00:03:54.319> stuff<00:03:54.560> in

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
this map and there's a lot of stuff in

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.409 
this map and there's a lot of stuff in
it<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:54.889> everything<00:03:55.669> that<00:03:55.700> happens<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.299> the

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
it so everything that happens in the

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.449 
it so everything that happens in the
settings<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.169> take<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:57.889> little<00:03:58.069> bit<00:03:58.189> longer

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
settings and so take a little bit longer

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.210 
settings and so take a little bit longer
than<00:03:58.760> they<00:03:58.970> typically<00:03:59.480> would<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.919> doesn't

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
than they typically would but it doesn't

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.309 
than they typically would but it doesn't
affect<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> performance<00:04:01.669> at<00:04:02.150> all<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.540> go<00:04:03.169> back

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
affect the performance at all I go back

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.649 
affect the performance at all I go back
to<00:04:03.470> my<00:04:03.500> download<00:04:04.069> there<00:04:04.549> it<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.790> again<00:04:04.939> hit<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
to my download there it is again hit the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:13.270 
to my download there it is again hit the
open<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.299> say<00:04:08.299> ok<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:11.889> we're<00:04:12.889> going<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.040> close

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
open and say ok and we're going to close

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.530 
open and say ok and we're going to close
this<00:04:13.489> up

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.110 

and<00:04:23.110> like<00:04:23.230> I<00:04:23.320> said<00:04:23.530> everything<00:04:24.070> takes<00:04:24.370> longer

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
and like I said everything takes longer

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240 
and like I said everything takes longer
in<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.510> menu<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:26.050> when<00:04:26.350> you're<00:04:26.470> using<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:27.010> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
in the menu but when you're using it it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:47.659 
in the menu but when you're using it it
works<00:04:27.490> fun

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:59.820 

so<00:04:48.669> everything<00:04:49.089> working<00:04:49.360> fine<00:04:49.659> so<00:04:58.740> some<00:04:59.740> of

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
so everything working fine so some of

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.679 
so everything working fine so some of
the<00:04:59.889> things<00:05:00.069> are<00:05:00.249> will<00:05:00.369> be<00:05:00.429> different<00:05:00.789> here<00:05:00.969> we

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
the things are will be different here we

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:02.939 
the things are will be different here we
just<00:05:01.839> turn<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.080> down<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.289> little<00:05:02.349> bit<00:05:02.589> all

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
just turn this down a little bit all

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.019 
just turn this down a little bit all
your<00:05:03.249> hotkeys<00:05:03.729> are<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:05.849> exactly<00:05:06.849> what

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
your hotkeys are that exactly what

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.419 
your hotkeys are that exactly what
they're<00:05:07.179> supposed<00:05:07.449> to<00:05:07.599> be<00:05:07.889> your<00:05:08.889> sync<00:05:09.189> button

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:09.429 
they're supposed to be your sync button

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:11.699 
they're supposed to be your sync button
works<00:05:09.639> like<00:05:09.849> you<00:05:09.969> expected<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.719> your<00:05:11.349> cue

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:11.709 
works like you expected to your cue
