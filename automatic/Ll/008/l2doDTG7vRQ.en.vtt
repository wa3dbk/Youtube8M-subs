00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
so here we are in invent 2016 and we're

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.480 
so here we are in invent 2016 and we're
gonna<00:00:09.960> have<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> quick<00:00:10.320> look<00:00:10.500> at<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:10.920> new<00:00:11.130> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
gonna have a quick look at the new it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
gonna have a quick look at the new it's
really<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.760> print<00:00:11.940> environment<00:00:12.410> how<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.470> access

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
really a print environment how to access

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.740 
really a print environment how to access
it<00:00:14.010> if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> go<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.550> the<00:00:14.639> environment<00:00:14.940> you'll

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it if you go to the environment you'll

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.120 
it if you go to the environment you'll
notice<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.110> we<00:00:16.200> have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.380> thread<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.890> print

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
notice that we have a thread a print

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150 
notice that we have a thread a print
icon<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.630> click<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> that'll<00:00:19.680> open<00:00:19.860> up

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
icon you click that and that'll open up

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
icon you click that and that'll open up
this<00:00:20.310> environment<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.119> transfer<00:00:21.750> our

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
this environment it's gonna transfer our

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
this environment it's gonna transfer our
model<00:00:22.169> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> environment<00:00:22.970> it's

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
model into the environment it's

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.400 
model into the environment it's
important<00:00:24.329> to<00:00:24.419> recognize<00:00:24.899> that<00:00:25.259> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
important to recognize that this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.600 
important to recognize that this
environment<00:00:25.919> is<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.070> separate<00:00:26.550> from

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
environment is actually separate from

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.760 
environment is actually separate from
the<00:00:27.090> design<00:00:27.390> environment<00:00:27.989> so<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> changes

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
the design environment so the changes

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.920 
the design environment so the changes
that<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.009> make<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.430> won't<00:00:29.720> won't<00:00:30.720> be

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
that we make here won't won't be

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.729 
that we make here won't won't be
reflected<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.559> the<00:00:31.710> CAD<00:00:32.099> design<00:00:32.399> environment

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
reflected in the CAD design environment

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.600 
reflected in the CAD design environment
so<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.220> things<00:00:35.430> you'll<00:00:35.579> notice

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so one of the first things you'll notice

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970 
so one of the first things you'll notice
is<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.360> white<00:00:36.690> wireframe<00:00:37.410> box<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
is we have this white wireframe box that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
is we have this white wireframe box that
basically<00:00:38.489> represents<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> print<00:00:39.510> envelope

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
basically represents the print envelope

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
basically represents the print envelope
with<00:00:40.199> our<00:00:40.379> default<00:00:40.800> printer<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.519> this<00:00:41.760> case

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
with our default printer in this case

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
with our default printer in this case
we've<00:00:42.359> a<00:00:42.629> default<00:00:43.050> printer<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.620> Park<00:00:43.920> in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we've a default printer is this Park in

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.869 
we've a default printer is this Park in
Bufferin<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.449> can<00:00:45.629> choose<00:00:45.870> any<00:00:46.230> number<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
Bufferin you can choose any number of

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
Bufferin you can choose any number of
printers<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.000> come<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.929> package<00:00:49.050> but

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
printers that come with the package but

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.720 
printers that come with the package but
also<00:00:49.649> you'll<00:00:50.039> note<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.249> you've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
also you'll note that you've got the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
also you'll note that you've got the
option<00:00:50.999> of<00:00:51.089> being<00:00:51.210> able<00:00:51.359> to<00:00:51.480> customize<00:00:51.899> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
option of being able to customize you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
option of being able to customize you
can<00:00:52.410> create<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.859> own<00:00:53.269> set<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.300> favorite<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
can create your own set a favorite and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.399 
can create your own set a favorite and
then<00:00:55.499> assign<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> default<00:00:56.989> let's<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.199> use

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
then assign a default let's just use

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.099 
then assign a default let's just use
this<00:00:58.620> barking<00:00:59.010> printer<00:00:59.429> is<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.640> default

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
this barking printer is a default

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.220 
this barking printer is a default
printer<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.320> case<00:01:01.499> and<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:04.110> go

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
printer in this case and and let's go

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.250 
printer in this case and and let's go
through<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> process<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.960> setting<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
through the process of now setting up a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.160 
through the process of now setting up a
typical<00:01:07.680> 3d<00:01:08.159> print<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.120> what<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.509> can<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> here

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
typical 3d print so what we can do here

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.510 
typical 3d print so what we can do here
is<00:01:10.320> you'll<00:01:10.470> notice<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> part<00:01:11.250> actually

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
is you'll notice that the part actually

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.749 
is you'll notice that the part actually
is<00:01:12.509> just<00:01:12.869> located<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> center<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
is just located about the center of the

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.569 
is just located about the center of the
print<00:01:14.970> envelope<00:01:15.799> what<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.460> do

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
print envelope what we really want to do

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.940 
print envelope what we really want to do
though<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> shift<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> part<00:01:19.320> around<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
though is shift the part around and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340 
though is shift the part around and
locate<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> based<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.570> preferences<00:01:22.140> we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
locate it based on our preferences we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.139 
locate it based on our preferences we
might<00:01:22.530> decide<00:01:22.829> that<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.000> want

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
might decide that we don't actually want

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.850 
might decide that we don't actually want
to<00:01:24.299> print<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> orientation<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.680> want

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to print it in this orientation we want

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
to print it in this orientation we want
to<00:01:25.920> change<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.219> orientation<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.149> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to change the orientation we want to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
to change the orientation we want to
move<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.719> position<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.619> part<00:01:28.860> around<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
move the position of the part around the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
move the position of the part around the
print<00:01:29.640> bed<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.869> ever<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> number<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> tools<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
print bed so ever a number of tools that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
print bed so ever a number of tools that
help<00:01:32.280> work<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.729> data<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> way<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
help work with data in this way the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.889 
help work with data in this way the
first<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.710> our<00:01:34.979> set<00:01:35.219> orientation<00:01:35.399> tool<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.840> if

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
first is our set orientation tool so if

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.289 
first is our set orientation tool so if
I<00:01:37.020> click<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.469> orientation<00:01:37.649> I<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.969> simply

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
I click set orientation I can simply

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
I click set orientation I can simply
choose<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.539> face<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.469> part<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.829> be

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
choose a face and the part will be

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
choose a face and the part will be
reorient<00:01:41.520> ated<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> position<00:01:42.570> based<00:01:43.500> on

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
reorient ated in the position based on

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.980 
reorient ated in the position based on
my<00:01:43.860> selection<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.149> note<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.630> still

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
my selection you note that it's still

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
my selection you note that it's still
positioned<00:01:46.500> about<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> center<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> print

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
positioned about the center of the print

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
positioned about the center of the print
bed<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.930> poses<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.649> issue<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.070> case

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
bed and that poses an issue in this case

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
bed and that poses an issue in this case
so<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.420> reposition<00:01:52.020> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so what we can do is just reposition it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.639 
so what we can do is just reposition it
so<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.039> go<00:01:53.159> set<00:01:53.399> position<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> choose<00:01:54.990> say

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so if I go set position and choose say

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.209 
so if I go set position and choose say
the<00:01:55.799> front<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.600> side<00:01:57.899> planes<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.829> our

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the front and the side planes of our

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
the front and the side planes of our
print<00:01:59.520> envelope<00:01:59.880> you'll<00:02:00.539> see<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> we've

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
print envelope you'll see that we've

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.349 
print envelope you'll see that we've
repositioned<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.549> print<00:02:02.820> article<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
repositioned the print article in this

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.840 
repositioned the print article in this
case<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.020> add<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:05.130> clearance<00:02:05.579> maybe

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
case we can add some clearance maybe

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
case we can add some clearance maybe
you'll<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:06.659> tolerance<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you'll want to have some tolerance to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
you'll want to have some tolerance to
make<00:02:07.649> sure<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.539> we're<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.570> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> cause

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
make sure that we're not going to cause

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.580 
make sure that we're not going to cause
any<00:02:10.110> issues<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.009> print<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.470> we'll<00:02:13.470> look

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
any issues with our print and we'll look

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
any issues with our print and we'll look
from<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> top<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:14.400> part<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.880> notice<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
from the top of our part and notice that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
from the top of our part and notice that
it's<00:02:15.690> been<00:02:15.900> positioned<00:02:16.500> from<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.890> front<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it's been positioned from the front and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's been positioned from the front and
the<00:02:18.210> side<00:02:18.390> plane<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.900> our<00:02:18.960> print

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the side plane of our print

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
the side plane of our print
now<00:02:20.270> one<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.600> things<00:02:20.810> you'll<00:02:21.050> notice<00:02:21.350> in

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
now one of the things you'll notice in

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.840 
now one of the things you'll notice in
this<00:02:21.620> position<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> part<00:02:22.640> actually

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
this position is the part actually

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730 
this position is the part actually
extends<00:02:23.569> beyond<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> boundary<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.500> print

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
extends beyond the boundary of the print

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.850 
extends beyond the boundary of the print
on<00:02:24.800> blow<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.910> what<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.380> maybe<00:02:27.560> look

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
on blow so what we can do is maybe look

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.590 
on blow so what we can do is maybe look
at<00:02:27.980> shrinking<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> part<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:28.910> could<00:02:29.120> use<00:02:29.420> our

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
at shrinking the part we could use our

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.920 
at shrinking the part we could use our
direct<00:02:29.870> edit<00:02:30.020> tools<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.590> shrink<00:02:30.830> apart<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.930> we

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
direct edit tools to shrink apart or we

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.809 
direct edit tools to shrink apart or we
can<00:02:33.140> partition<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.770> part<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.220> segregate<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
can partition the part and segregate it

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.820 
can partition the part and segregate it
into<00:02:35.090> multiple<00:02:35.270> sections<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:36.620> be

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
into multiple sections to then be

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.370 
into multiple sections to then be
reassembled<00:02:37.250> after<00:02:37.910> printing<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.260> way

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
reassembled after printing so the way

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380 
reassembled after printing so the way
that<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.709> do<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.280> using<00:02:40.520> what<00:02:40.850> we

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
that we can do this is using what we

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.600 
that we can do this is using what we
call<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.840> partition<00:02:42.319> tool<00:02:42.500> when<00:02:43.220> thankfully

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
call the partition tool when thankfully

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.940 
call the partition tool when thankfully
this<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.790> basically<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:44.900> automated<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:45.860> us

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
this is basically all automated for us

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.090 
this is basically all automated for us
so<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.340> click<00:02:46.610> on<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.819> partition<00:02:47.180> tool<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.100> I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
so I click on the partition tool and I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.979 
so I click on the partition tool and I
can<00:02:49.160> choose<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.940> plane<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.660> want<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> use

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
can choose the plane that I want to use

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.870 
can choose the plane that I want to use
in<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.230> case<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.620> use<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.800> back<00:02:52.100> plane<00:02:52.400> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
in this case we use the back plane of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
in this case we use the back plane of
our<00:02:53.060> printer<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:54.500> will<00:02:54.800> then<00:02:54.830> go<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
our printer and that will then go and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.470 
our printer and that will then go and
segregate<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> bodies<00:02:56.330> into<00:02:57.170> two<00:02:57.620> sections

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
segregate the bodies into two sections

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.699 
segregate the bodies into two sections
another<00:02:59.480> thing<00:02:59.690> it'll<00:02:59.870> do<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.200> it'll<00:03:00.410> enable

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
another thing it'll do is it'll enable

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.520 
another thing it'll do is it'll enable
us<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:00.980> insert<00:03:01.519> alignment<00:03:02.330> aids<00:03:02.750> for<00:03:03.170> when<00:03:03.410> we

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
us to insert alignment aids for when we

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.229 
us to insert alignment aids for when we
go<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.769> reassemble<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.310> parts<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.120> this

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
go and reassemble the parts so in this

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.570 
go and reassemble the parts so in this
case<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:05.660> I'll<00:03:05.750> do<00:03:05.980> there's<00:03:06.980> add<00:03:07.310> some

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
case what I'll do there's add some

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.270 
case what I'll do there's add some
alignment<00:03:07.850> aids<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:08.450> use<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:09.040> 1<00:03:10.040> mil

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
alignment aids and then use a 1 mil

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.170 
alignment aids and then use a 1 mil
depth<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:11.090> 1<00:03:11.870> wheel<00:03:12.050> diameter<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.920> 5<00:03:13.850> degrees

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
depth a 1 wheel diameter and 5 degrees

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.350 
depth a 1 wheel diameter and 5 degrees
if<00:03:14.330> dark<00:03:14.600> draft<00:03:15.130> let's<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.340> reorient<00:03:16.910> 8<00:03:17.120> so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
if dark draft let's just reorient 8 so

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.850 
if dark draft let's just reorient 8 so
we're<00:03:17.510> positioned<00:03:18.110> add<00:03:18.830> some<00:03:19.489> points<00:03:20.860> we'll

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
we're positioned add some points we'll

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:34.390 
we're positioned add some points we'll
click<00:03:22.250> one<00:03:22.940> on<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> left<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.160> right

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.180 

go<00:03:35.030> okay<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.739> give<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.040> moment

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
go okay and if we give it a moment

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.619 
go okay and if we give it a moment
you'll<00:03:37.610> actually<00:03:37.790> find<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.360> what<00:03:38.420> it's

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
you'll actually find that what it's

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.140 
you'll actually find that what it's
doing<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.019> it's<00:03:39.200> segregating<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.980> body<00:03:40.220> into

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
doing is it's segregating the body into

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.690 
doing is it's segregating the body into
multiple<00:03:41.599> bodies<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.140> it's<00:03:43.129> adding<00:03:43.459> features

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
multiple bodies and it's adding features

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.820 
multiple bodies and it's adding features
that'll<00:03:44.180> enables<00:03:44.659> to<00:03:44.989> reassemble<00:03:45.709> and

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
that'll enables to reassemble and

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.800 
that'll enables to reassemble and
realign<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.580> parts<00:03:47.090> once<00:03:47.420> we've<00:03:47.569> printed

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
realign these parts once we've printed

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.199 
realign these parts once we've printed
them<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.290> you'll<00:03:48.409> see<00:03:48.590> here<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:49.220> split<00:03:49.670> the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
them so you'll see here it's split the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.050 
them so you'll see here it's split the
bodies<00:03:50.510> almost<00:03:51.470> also<00:03:52.190> notice<00:03:52.549> in<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> solid

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
bodies almost also notice in the solid

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.539 
bodies almost also notice in the solid
bodies<00:03:53.329> folder<00:03:53.659> we<00:03:53.810> have<00:03:53.840> two<00:03:54.170> bodies<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.739> we

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
bodies folder we have two bodies if we

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.190 
bodies folder we have two bodies if we
change<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.940> visibility<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> main<00:03:57.019> body

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
change the visibility of the main body

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.860 
change the visibility of the main body
you'll<00:03:57.620> notice<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.220> our<00:03:58.879> smaller<00:03:59.239> body<00:03:59.510> has

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you'll notice that our smaller body has

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.430 
you'll notice that our smaller body has
a<00:04:00.170> couple<00:04:01.159> of<00:04:01.220> pins<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.879> our<00:04:02.840> main<00:04:02.989> body<00:04:03.200> will

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
a couple of pins and our main body will

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.750 
a couple of pins and our main body will
have<00:04:03.530> holes<00:04:03.829> in<00:04:04.069> it<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.250> we'll<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.700> a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
have holes in it and we'll see that in a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.270 
have holes in it and we'll see that in a
moment<00:04:04.879> but<00:04:05.180> let's<00:04:05.500> just<00:04:06.500> turn<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.890> back<00:04:07.099> on

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
moment but let's just turn that back on

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.180 
moment but let's just turn that back on
and<00:04:07.519> position<00:04:08.239> this<00:04:08.450> second<00:04:09.410> piece<00:04:09.590> back<00:04:09.980> into

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and position this second piece back into

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.470 
and position this second piece back into
the<00:04:10.370> print<00:04:10.579> envelope<00:04:10.910> now<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.180> way<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.420> we

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the print envelope now the way that we

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.210 
the print envelope now the way that we
do<00:04:11.629> that<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.959> basically<00:04:12.560> using<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:13.040> same

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
do that is basically using the same

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.800 
do that is basically using the same
tools<00:04:13.549> and<00:04:13.760> techniques<00:04:14.120> as<00:04:14.269> we<00:04:14.450> did<00:04:14.629> earlier

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
tools and techniques as we did earlier

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.949 
tools and techniques as we did earlier
so<00:04:15.260> we'll<00:04:15.590> go<00:04:15.769> set<00:04:16.669> orientation<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:17.780> case

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
so we'll go set orientation in this case

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.210 
so we'll go set orientation in this case
we're<00:04:18.139> going<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.350> choose<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.769> body<00:04:18.919> because

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
we're going to choose the body because

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.400 
we're going to choose the body because
there's<00:04:19.430> more<00:04:19.549> than<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:19.880> body's<00:04:20.260> choose<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
there's more than one body's choose the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.159 
there's more than one body's choose the
face<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.859> we<00:04:21.979> want<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.220> use<00:04:22.340> as<00:04:22.520> our

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
face that we want to use as our

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.140 
face that we want to use as our
alignment<00:04:24.169> aid<00:04:24.500> for<00:04:24.710> orientation<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.940> go

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
alignment aid for orientation and go

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.860 
alignment aid for orientation and go
okay<00:04:26.860> let's<00:04:27.860> change<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.430> position<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.690> this

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
okay let's change the position in this

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.150 
okay let's change the position in this
case<00:04:30.139> choosing<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.280> body<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.800> say<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.949> side

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
case choosing the body and say the side

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.400 
case choosing the body and say the side
wall<00:04:34.960> again<00:04:35.960> we'll<00:04:36.139> add<00:04:36.289> some<00:04:36.500> clearance<00:04:37.010> okay

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
wall again we'll add some clearance okay

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.320 
wall again we'll add some clearance okay
and<00:04:39.410> we<00:04:39.560> now<00:04:39.710> have<00:04:39.950> that<00:04:40.070> in<00:04:40.250> position<00:04:40.370> so

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
and we now have that in position so

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.940 
and we now have that in position so
you'll<00:04:41.510> now<00:04:41.690> see<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.960> we've<00:04:42.229> got<00:04:42.349> those<00:04:42.530> pins

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
you'll now see that we've got those pins

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.339 
you'll now see that we've got those pins
we've<00:04:43.550> got<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.849> body<00:04:44.060> alive<00:04:44.389> got<00:04:44.930> some<00:04:45.110> holes

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
we've got the body alive got some holes

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.230 
we've got the body alive got some holes
in<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.710> main<00:04:45.860> body<00:04:46.099> if<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.610> go<00:04:46.760> from<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.030> top

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
in the main body if I go from the top

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.850 
in the main body if I go from the top
and<00:04:47.539> have<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.690> quick<00:04:47.870> look<00:04:47.930> down<00:04:48.289> you'll<00:04:48.620> see

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
and have a quick look down you'll see

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.140 
and have a quick look down you'll see
that<00:04:49.070> everything's<00:04:49.490> with<00:04:49.669> inside<00:04:50.030> the
