00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.320
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.040
 in this section we have a different recipes 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 We will share the description of "Red Cabbage" 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560
 but if you want to have a look at the necessary materials 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.480
 1 piece of red cabbage (about 1 kilo) 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.240
 1 coffee cup rock salt 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.160
 1 pc of sugar cubes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.200
 1 teaspoon of lemon salt 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.680
 1 small head of garlic 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 a few sprigs of parsley 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360
 1 large tea cup of grape vinegar 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.560
 and water 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.120
 we learned the necessary ingredients for red sauerkraut. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.400
 firstly we washed our red cabbage beautifully in vinegar 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 Let's start by cutting 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.800
 in this way we will chop large 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 we have 1 small head of garlic after the cabbage 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.360
 Let's clean the garlic of our garlic 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 and pound 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 we will use as a whole 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.440
 only the rahiya coming out of the oppressed will be enough for us 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.800
 red cabbage has a harder texture than white cabbage 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.480
 we will rub a little with our hands for him 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 on the rock salt, lemon salt ... 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 and added sugar 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 we'll rub a little to relax 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.480
 as shown 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.240
 and loosened 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.680
 now we are filling into a jar of appropriate size with this shape 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 of course with garlic 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 a few branches of parsley we left on 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320
 grape vinegar ... 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.320
 and fill the water until it completes 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.400
 we will fill your mouth 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.720
 now we're closing the lid tightly 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.960
 Serine and dark environment for at least 10 days, preferably 15 days 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 after 2 weeks 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.560
 it was our pickle, I believe it was waiting 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560
 Let's unpack now 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.200
 yes excitement at the last point 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 Very nice, no distortion 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.520
 Let's take our cabbages from now on 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.160
 some painted material 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.720
 We have shared a different recipe in this section in the modest Taste Cuisine. 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 We learned the construction of "Red Cabbage" 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.720
 I wish you to do and remember us 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.840
 Goodbye sir ...
