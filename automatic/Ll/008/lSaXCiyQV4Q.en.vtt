00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.419
 I did not imagine that it would happen like that 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.319
 honestly basically as 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.319
 institution 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.450

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.790
 we have selected the former captain of the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.860
 selection of honduras and idol motagÃ¼ense 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.980
 beloved guevara attended sports daily 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.230
 ten in the privacy of your home after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.270
 of his controversial separation from the camp 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.640
 blue the wolf decided to tell details of 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.520
 how this situation happened that has been 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 very questioned by the way in which 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.270
 he announced his departure they did not meet me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.770
 have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.770
 state Tuesday 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.670
 On Friday we do medical exams 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.170
 routines that are undertaken three 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.350
 preseason on Sunday I had to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 to be 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.080
 in his house 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.450
 president the lord the news and for me 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 that was true I did not expect it 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.590
 I thought that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.210
 that if they are going to touch other expected topics 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 but in the end good news the beginning 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.390
 Logically, they were not telling me 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.060
 something nice something nice 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.520
 the answers out there were always 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.740
 difficult to answer the opposites 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.210
 when I finish cutting that I do not 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.149
 they gave you no arguments 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.050
 afterwards not only because not that 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.470
 decision of the directors 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.170
 and part of the technical staff that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.240
 for motagua and that was not in a 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 institution had a last meeting the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.760
 Wednesday and I put him on expressions 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 concerns of the conditions that they 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.060
 they put 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.740
 they remained firm in their position and not 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.470
 will mention that to return and that nothing in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.470
 conditions was what they 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.000
 in contracts talking financially 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.099
 but with the condition of not playing in 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.769
 no other equipment 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.090
 then to me it strikes me 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.640
 that has me a little restless that so 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.130
 unless that decision will take it I know what 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.740
 I was going to do 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.960
 you already think that we meet already 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.970
 or be firm in that position 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.900
 the talks and own the nine 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.030
 there is conditional 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.819
 the ad the wolf said feel 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 betrayed frustrated and has even cried 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.230
 for this decision that was taken but not 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.590
 he wanted to confirm the closing of a 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.220
 story and chapter with deep blue 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 I visit sad 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 most selected selected why 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 as my contract says of the three 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.810
 years 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.650
 say goodbye to people have the last 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.650
 chance of the 13th to the team 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.300
 there was another personal goal like that of 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.300
 the edges 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.460
 so 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.540
 in the morning because of the future only god 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.820
 he knows it, not because I can say the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 I come back mounted and suddenly he hires me 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.360
 in another side of the future believe me that I do not 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.480
 I'm going to talk 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.240
 I leave that to God about his future and 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.080
 I had thought of it in January 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.020
 and so study here this for 27 years the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.690
 footballer can be a bit high in the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.880
 life of a person who heard something else 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.770

 I already put it in the hands of God he takes 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.620
 control and the rest 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.349
