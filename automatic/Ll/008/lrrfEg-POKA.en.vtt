00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.620
 new measures if your opinion 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.689
 he does not make more than a third of his lists in his career 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.099
 at the moment he is explaining to us what implies the irresponsibility of 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.139
 soloist 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.060
 the first is that this word 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.509
 this source but I do not know what it is 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 save that with the palette offered 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 trumpet solo trombone surprising thing that could feed themselves in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.019
 head a few 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.829
 that's what we were able to 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.989
 so voluntarily in the tourmalet while it is a good accompaniment 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 for a color can not say that we have a leading role as yet 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 underwater for example 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850
 first smile 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 every day it is especially the p 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.110
 this world 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 more or less difficult is always something to play alone government 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 the darker for the colors for 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.510
 dramatic 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 also to the power role anyway because my client no longer wishes 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.610
 play before relatively strong and also very tripod om 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.820
 this day most often 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.180
 and percent 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.190
 because for the company 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.310
 and the highest corporate tax is sullen the summer at 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.970
 level of cohesion of the control console first then with 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.910
 all sections of copper 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.030
 to draw a desk from 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.610
 on the other hand the style of play that makes the sign of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 I am more or less not to understand what had just asked him 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.270
 precisely because we have the pressure of the tasks more and more current 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.160
 on accuracy 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.230
 balancing software on a desk manageable it can very well happen a 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.280
 day tell me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.460
 green young people this partnership with new strong jersey forget about voices 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.830
 colleagues of the public management 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.160
 but one day there is very unlikely 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.080
 for what I do not know it appears to look at the strains 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 appropriate but still 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 their employer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.570
 it happened after an exchange if that 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.250
 to that that level 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 it's more a responsibility to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 cohesion 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 the palonosetron dispatched to do balanced together in his motives and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 if necessary 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 four points from the afp commission 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.899
 here are his words 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.719
 essaoui not so much that it burns retraces 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.659
 a few days ago 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.349
 on the facts are there these fights 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.889
 lucian i still need 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.529
 but precisely when you have these great solos to interpret how 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.879
 do you handle the stress of this 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.170
 for the parliamentarian will also look at the point of making his return to 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.849
 the balanced who aspire to 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.049
 the anguished 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.659
 which were appreciated 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 in addition a preparation of work areas and no work 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.399
 the bias of the page is good 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.019
 of the bomb not to say that we are really nervous because in their place when we play 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.249
 for the other 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.669
 that's it for sporting 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.669
 this paradox when we play soloist 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.799
 what allows a grandmother very much want to stay at a standstill what 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.559
 level 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.549
 tatataaa 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.859
 every worker 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.319
 it is also true to negotiate a solution on the conditions of this kind 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.319
 of consumer behaviors pressure to push m 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.109
 boss I am not more than three years 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.469
 not too much 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.689
 finally things just take a lot of fun to conclude 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.689
 especially me it is primordial 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.499
 serious
