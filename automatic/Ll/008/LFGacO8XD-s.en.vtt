00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.120 
at the lake during certain times of the
year<00:03:48.730> geese<00:03:49.450> you'll<00:03:49.750> also<00:03:49.960> find<00:03:50.380> geese<00:03:50.770> here

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
year geese you'll also find geese here

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.180 
year geese you'll also find geese here
here<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> couple<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.630> ducks<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.650> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
here a couple of the ducks that that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.430 
here a couple of the ducks that that
hang<00:03:54.370> around<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.820> lake<00:03:55.000> all<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.750> time

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
hang around the lake all the time

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.190 
hang around the lake all the time
I<00:03:56.490> think<00:03:57.490> people<00:03:57.820> feed<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.270> ducks<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.870> so

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
I think people feed the ducks and so

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:15.290 
I think people feed the ducks and so
they<00:03:59.850> they<00:04:00.850> hang<00:04:01.060> around

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:24.740 

and<00:04:15.990> here<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.970> few<00:04:17.970> folks<00:04:18.209> fishing<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:24.360> area

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
and here is a few folks fishing the area

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.260 
and here is a few folks fishing the area
oh<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.300> can<00:04:27.480> fish<00:04:27.720> for<00:04:28.050> from<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.980> side

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
oh you you can fish for from the side

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.610 
oh you you can fish for from the side
there<00:04:30.270> or<00:04:30.600> from<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.590> pavilion<00:04:32.340> areas<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:34.440> the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
there or from the pavilion areas on the

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.160 
there or from the pavilion areas on the
day<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.800> we<00:04:35.520> visited<00:04:36.090> two<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.600> pavilions

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
day that we visited two of the pavilions

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.490 
day that we visited two of the pavilions
I<00:04:37.380> think<00:04:37.590> had<00:04:37.710> probably<00:04:38.130> been<00:04:38.250> rented<00:04:38.940> by

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
I think had probably been rented by

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.400 
I think had probably been rented by
families<00:04:40.500> or<00:04:40.740> business<00:04:41.250> groups<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.180> they

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
families or business groups and so they

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.760 
families or business groups and so they
they<00:04:43.410> -<00:04:43.800> two<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.220> them<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:44.550> closed<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.590> that

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
they - two of them more closed and that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.240 
they - two of them more closed and that
basically<00:04:47.220> ends<00:04:47.760> our<00:04:48.210> tour<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.920> Oxford
