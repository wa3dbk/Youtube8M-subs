00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello how about this time we are going to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 repair a mitsui TV the model the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 truth does not appear since they ripped 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.539
 the label 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.670
 but if I'm not mistaken, it 's similar to 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:24.730
 mitsubishi 29 08 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.620
 29 0 29 08 I do not remember the termination 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.080
 but I think it 's something like that 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.950
 this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.360
 good for the type of circuits at 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.360
 we can better guide ourselves 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 bring a one chip 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.070
 it is the ideal 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.070
 exercise 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.730
 this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.730
 the good chip 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.379
 is the leaf 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.140
 76 93 1s 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.320
 termination 7 n 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.260
 with that and another one you can already take out 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.659
 the conclusions if it is the same as your 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.880
 apparatus 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.470
 well this device did not bring it since 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.480
 do not learn 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 I do not put it in front because I do not know 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.440
 catch up to see 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.440
 when you turn on the led 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.080
 A) Yes 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.650
 you can remove the light so they can see that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.650
 it turns on 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 we connect 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.350
 I have learned 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 although the source is working well I 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.430
 I feel this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 and we learn 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.689
 and we do not have 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.510
 there is no high voltage 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.200
 it does not even reach to learn 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.200
 there is nothing 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:28.150
 then this we are going to review and right now 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 I can tell you where we check 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.230
 let's do some tests to see what 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.480
 diagnosis has 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.480
 then this is the mitsui 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:52.740
 it seems to me that in 1908 the termination did not 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.910
 I remember it but let's review it 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:01.640
 well we have already fixed what 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.710
 we saw on this television is that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.710
 we had this transistor 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.130
 this little one 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.939
 they were short 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.319
 which has been the 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.280
 892 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.930
 but well I feel this 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 and by placing that transistor my error was 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.750
 not approve before there was no other 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.630
 short and I can I put it back in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.640
 short then this transistor was not 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.260
 feeding what is the vertical output 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.959
 what is this 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.250
 then the vertical circuit enters 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.160
 was also short and we changed the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.690
 vertical circuit 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.690
 and we change the transistor 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.490
 We saw that he was already learning but he had a 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.490
 fold on top 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.830
 on our television then 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.560
 this I had to change this 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.420
 filter 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.750
 and this other 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.700
 this of plane showed us that no longer and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.310
 it was no longer marking us anything and this 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.740
 and we went to check the majority of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.650
 the filters that are in the stage 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.250
 heating techniques we notice 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.450
 that was shot 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.450
 then let them show you 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.940
 the little one here 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.190
 this 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.290
 is this 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.060
 I tried it and showed us that no longer 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.580
 it marked us nothing then we got to 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.120
 review all the filtering is what they 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.880
 I always recommend that there are pieces that 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 they are heated preferably also in 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.020
 that they try the filtering since many 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.440
 Sometimes this is dry then at the time 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.289
 to try several filters this coming 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.419
 being this one 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.840
 and there you can realize that it is 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.770
 sandblasting 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.910
 then I estimate our device is already 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:45.580
 and I told them about the change this 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:47.919
 in the vertical circuit filter and it 's like that 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.129
 in this work in our device already 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.129
 is 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.590
 in the mirror and up 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.669
 then this 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.949
 for you I'm working when 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.070
 any kind of comment does not 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.210
 can do to get the 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.160
 vertical circuit 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.160
 It was this 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.150
 there is 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.280
 Not only can you comment on any doubt or 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.960
 suggestion that they have can I 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.960
 get to do until achieve
