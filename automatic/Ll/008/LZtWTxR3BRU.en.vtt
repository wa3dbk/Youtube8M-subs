00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
useful tweak so this week is called deck

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.319 
useful tweak so this week is called deck
it's<00:03:34.509> made<00:03:34.780> by<00:03:35.049> SB<00:03:35.680> coders<00:03:36.189> and<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.879> came<00:03:37.090> out

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
it's made by SB coders and it came out

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.300 
it's made by SB coders and it came out
two<00:03:37.540> days<00:03:37.780> ago<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.769> could<00:03:39.069> be<00:03:39.280> our

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
two days ago so this could be our

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.749 
two days ago so this could be our
sbsettings<00:03:40.060> competitor<00:03:40.989> but<00:03:41.739> sbsettings<00:03:42.310> is

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:42.759 
sbsettings competitor but sbsettings is

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.360 
sbsettings competitor but sbsettings is
actually<00:03:43.449> a<00:03:43.479> bit<00:03:43.780> more<00:03:43.959> useful<00:03:44.439> than<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.799> but

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
actually a bit more useful than this but

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.179 
actually a bit more useful than this but
this<00:03:45.519> could<00:03:45.790> be<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> very<00:03:46.269> good<00:03:46.949> alternative<00:03:47.949> to

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
this could be a very good alternative to

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.939 
this could be a very good alternative to
sbsettings<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.840> once<00:03:49.989> again<00:03:50.109> this<00:03:50.409> tweak<00:03:50.739> is
