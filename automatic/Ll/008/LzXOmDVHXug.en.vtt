classrooms with groups of children and
individual<00:01:40.030> children<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:42.070> do<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:42.910> well<00:01:43.390> here

think<00:01:47.160> many<00:01:48.160> schools<00:01:48.580> just<00:01:48.880> don't<00:01:49.150> feel<00:01:49.330> like

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
think many schools just don't feel like

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.690 
think many schools just don't feel like
they<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.170> takes<00:01:50.320> more<00:01:50.530> time<00:01:50.770> do

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
they can do that it takes more time do

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.280 
they can do that it takes more time do
you<00:01:51.790> have<00:01:51.940> any<00:01:52.090> advice<00:01:52.480> for<00:01:52.540> other<00:01:52.840> kids<00:01:53.200> who

play but what we are setting out to do

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.980 
play but what we are setting out to do
is<00:01:58.600> not<00:01:58.810> rare<00:01:59.170> but<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.270> environment

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
is not rare but that the environment

supports what we set out to do that's

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.340 
supports what we set out to do that's
what<00:02:04.570> seems<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.930> be<00:02:05.130> rare<00:02:06.130> these<00:02:06.550> days<00:02:06.610> and
