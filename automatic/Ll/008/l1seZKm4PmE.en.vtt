00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.449 
them up and just put them in the front
and<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.310> now<00:04:05.459> when<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.700> put<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:07.160> print<00:04:08.160> like

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
and so now when you put it in print like

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.850 
and so now when you put it in print like
this<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:11.150> then<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.480> place<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.050> in<00:04:13.170> there<00:04:13.410> now

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
this and then you place it in there now

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.740 
this and then you place it in there now
this<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.370> money<00:04:14.519> storage<00:04:15.150> space<00:04:15.480> where

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
this is for money storage space where

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.479 
this is for money storage space where
you<00:04:15.840> could<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.140> place<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:17.340> you're

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
you could just place it if you're

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.770 
you could just place it if you're
pulling<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.820> money<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:18.060> everyday<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:18.720> I

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
pulling the money out everyday that I

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.330 
pulling the money out everyday that I
wouldn't<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:22.830> like<00:04:23.130> that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
