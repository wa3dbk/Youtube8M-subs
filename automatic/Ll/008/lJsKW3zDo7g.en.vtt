00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.970
 other theme same occasion 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.120
 I do not know if you are 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.590
 I 'm doing now anyway I just know 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.080
 offers 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.810
 How to set the to 1 that is 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.490
 build and set an edition 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:31.490
 We decided to vote first 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.000
 yes not chic but works and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.280
 she has to go in first 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:45.290
 this is what this bracket around this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:49.100
 hold the clip first removed the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:01:02.120
 Ignition of magnets can do so and this 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:06.590
 is roughly positioned i hope that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.860
 As you can see, the ignition has one here 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.860
 mark 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 and the engine should be here as well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.310
 First, very roughly on top of each other 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.490
 after that this will screw and this 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.560
 screw with the clamp again 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 used to fix this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.780
 just hand-tighten so that you can 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.350
 can still readjust this afterwards 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.940
 whole looks then just reflected off 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.960
 so you can still easily print them 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.400
 can go careful with the crescent 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:15.010
 on the crankshaft and then that will 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 The platinum is positioned and ready 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.910
 screwed in the simple part so 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.489
 very important to make sure that that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.890
 that Pohl Rat has the mark in the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:32.530
 case 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 moment I hope that's the way it is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.650
 to recognize there is the pure mario 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:47.140
 this is far more important in this case 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 the bi guess why above 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.250
 out to the square 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 we need the watch for the clock 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.100
 Let's face all the payments with the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.230
 and as accurately as possible 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.980
 adjust 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.239
 So then we come to the topic 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.680
 restriction on we use 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.600
 basically settings as I said 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.260
 to adjust to the exact as possible 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.570
 when selecting the pins is on it too 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.489
 Make sure you do not do that too long 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.250
 so if you have the piston first 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.890
 not only moves up back out through 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.530
 or damaged so that looks whole then 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.070
 ready assembled so we think 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.070
 now new items 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.270
 so now we just have to go first 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.040
 determine the top dead center 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.300
 he is turned to the front and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.190
 sometime reached with the highest 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.190
 point nice and even center forward 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.300
 here he falls back that is 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:20.650
 that 's the moment the first point then 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:22.870
 the clock will be set to new here 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 exactly as possible 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.850
 I always do that so I will 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:35.200
 to turn a prober round to see if 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:37.750
 Something has shifted since now 10 um 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 18 before the ot back that is the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:48.160
 time that is a rotation to 1 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.370
 that's 1.8 and you can see it here now 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.470
 exactly at this point where the powder 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.690
 This mark would be the mark 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.240
 Ignore the engine then look closely 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.979
 then you realize that not all three 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.039
 that is, that points match 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:06.400
 In this case, Pohl Rat is the default 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.140
 when pretty much at the moment where the pohl 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.610
 advice now also the original paint 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.690
 This engine will not start 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.310
 that can happen when my age 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.680
 Ignition systems with new engines or 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.870
 conversely, that combines this original 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.419
 mark does not match that is 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.930
 We will now face the base plate 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.550
 the against this mark despite all 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.070
 the rotate forward and the cyclist 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.270
 to adjust 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.880
 as I said this screw again 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:38.260
 Easily loosen and screw this easily 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.560
 solve and then you can easily so 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.910
 chair 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.910
 pose without problems 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.750
 but a whole corner before 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.320
 then I fix a screw now 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.650
 very roughly and now we do the whole thing 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.650
 once again 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:17.599
 1.8 seen almost the same match again 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.599
 create a hand 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:43.639
 there heads out but still fix again 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:47.360
 Let's check pastorate and vote borrow 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.360
 I hope you see it that way
