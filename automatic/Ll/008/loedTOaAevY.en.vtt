00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.100
 hi everyone how are you like this 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.320
 video is a little shorter than 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.230
 normal because we are going to do the contest 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.870
 of triples in the all-star of no bar 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.670
 Read them that we have been selected I 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.070
 seen that besides the people who usually 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.759
 upload videos of this game has not had 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.099
 the luck of doing this contest so 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.649
 let's do it ourselves this is in 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.470
 false live now you will see how it came out 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:33.050
 next and I have to do a criticism not to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.719
 this game mode in particular to 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.269
 Thrips competition of the 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.079
 all-star because it gave me the feeling of 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.660
 which is not very well implemented 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.030
 controls with the control set there that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.969
 it has been seen on the scoreboard that it was 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.670
 houston I think it's a little bit a 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.120
 a little unfortunate while we see that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.839
 kevin martin has made 17 points now goes 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 marcus thorton and good as I say is like 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.420
 what 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 that is not well implemented hands 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.600
 also implemented the gameplay for 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.790
 this for this game mode because it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.759
 Suppose you have the left trigger 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.340
 that with which you take the ball of the car 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.890
 and then you have to do the suspension and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 stop the ball in a specific place 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 so that the launch is last now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.909
 You will see it when you do and do it and it was 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.409
 really almost impossible to put it in the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.390
 good site for the launch 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.030
 it was optimal 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.520
 here we are watching guiding smith wanted 11 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.700
 points at the time I played it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.030
 this I tried to look for information while 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 let's see now nico batum about on 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.240
 what people thought 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.750
 of the gameplay of this game mode 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 only 11 points batum and good is people 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 who told me on twitter what happened to him 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 same as I thought the command had it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.440
 broken because he did not respond well and good 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.869
 we go with the releases of nes and here 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 with the left trigger he grabs the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.560
 ball you have to do the suspension 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.670
 keeping the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.020
 tight button and then stop the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.650
 throwing has the right ball drop 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.580
 there where the bar comes that energy and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.380
 it's practically impossible 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.570
 I just tried it once but 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 As you can see, I was taking my time 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.670
 also to try to do well the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.950
 launch and I was freaking 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.530
 saying this this is the way to do 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.800
 I did not like the launch 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.520
 I was almost doing it volley 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.280
 trying to do the launching well 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.740
 but what came out was practically a 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.950
 volley ey as you see it has nine points 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.830
 for the moment we were outside we were left 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.990
 only the last car with time 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:02.860
 just 10 11 12 the last car comes already 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.970
 see the multicolored inside 14 that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.720
 we tied to try to pass the round 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.360
 so we'll have to make a jump-off 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.980
 with thompson clip as you see in this 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.400
 first round the annotations are 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.110
 normalitas because the record is at 25 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.940
 who did 6 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.060
 a capo I do not think it was in 2000 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.400
 in 2008 it may be good was out there 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.290
 he won twice besides Jason Kapono the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.230
 triple contest and in the final it 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.950
 hit 25 points I think there was another 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.750
 player who made 25 points in the 80s 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.630
 but it was not in the end but well this is 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.110
 a fact that sounds like I've heard it 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.180
 time 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.460
 watching a triple contest that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.680
 they said but well it's not the same I dreamed it and 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.250
 As you can see we are in the tiebreaker that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.580
 time to launch two cars be better 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.680
 some more balls failing all the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.850
 rival had put 8 for which we were going 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.300
 ready and at the end 3 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.950
 three points in the jump-off here we 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.890
 we are here is the story of 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.160
 next and in this triple contest 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.260
 you can say less those that you have played 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.630
 what's the marker that you put and what 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.020
 houston what about the rockets seems to me 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.960
 truth very very strong but good 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.569
 clayton are with their releases that has 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 done 17 dots very well good as 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.090
 tell me can you tell me what you have 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.159
 played this game mode if it happened to you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.710
 the same as me that remains 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.050
 practically impossible to stop him 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 launch where the bar asks you 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.569
 of that energy have tied me in addition 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.710
 at the moment there is thomson with kevin 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:56.740
 martin here comes marcus thorton let's go to 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.389
 see how he did it this happened 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.300
 of course I did not even want to see it because 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.370
 I was pretty streaked saying fuck 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.840
 with how well he threw triple when 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.289
 I'm alone in the matches that I have 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.690
 welcome the mechanics and here you have me 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.639
 gone out has gone fatal has not left me 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.250
 like the ass or they will have to do 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.660
 tie-break klay thompson and kevin martin 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.690
 there goes the one that left us in the gutter 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.540
 in the tiebreaker round 19 dots 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.720
 does not even reach 20 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.660
 and aver kevin martin what does he have to 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.500
 do 20 to win the contest of 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.270
 triples of new orleans although today 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.990
 go out to the rockets on the scoreboard did 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.080
 11 so look at our executioner is 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.420
 who wins the triple and 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.250
 well I'm going to leave here this video 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.520
 As you know, you can tell me 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.160
 opinions about what I told you about the type 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.830
 of playability in this way and the 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.920
 next video will be the party of the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 Eastern stars against the west like this 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.120
 goodbye goodbye see you later chau chau 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.120
 behaving well is the following video
