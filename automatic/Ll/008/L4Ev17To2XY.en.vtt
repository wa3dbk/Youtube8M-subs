00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
10 pounds I actually learned a lot about

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.529 
10 pounds I actually learned a lot about
my<00:07:32.589> eating<00:07:32.829> habits<00:07:33.339> during<00:07:33.490> this<00:07:33.729> process<00:07:34.240> in

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539 
my eating habits during this process in

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.409 
my eating habits during this process in
which<00:07:34.809> I<00:07:34.990> often<00:07:35.349> eat<00:07:35.829> because<00:07:36.639> I'm<00:07:36.789> bored<00:07:37.089> and

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
which I often eat because I'm bored and

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:38.939 
which I often eat because I'm bored and
not<00:07:38.050> because<00:07:38.379> I'm<00:07:38.499> hungry

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:38.949

not because I'm hungry
and<00:07:39.249> I<00:07:39.550> think<00:07:39.849> that<00:07:40.029> was<00:07:40.360> the<00:07:40.749> best<00:07:41.079> lesson<00:07:41.619> I

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:41.769

and I think that was the best lesson I
could<00:07:41.979> have<00:07:42.069> learned<00:07:42.249> overall<00:07:42.879> so<00:07:43.389> that's<00:07:43.569> my

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:43.749 
could have learned overall so that's my

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:45.239 
could have learned overall so that's my
whole<00:07:43.930> tip<00:07:44.199> but<00:07:44.379> I<00:07:44.439> hope<00:07:44.589> that<00:07:44.800> you<00:07:44.949> like<00:07:45.099> to
