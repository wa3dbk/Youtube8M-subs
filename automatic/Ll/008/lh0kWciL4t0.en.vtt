00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.110
 So we also have the paragraph with it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.450

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.160

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.660
 Here they are protected by kamminke 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.660
 from it is not long until I get there 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.490

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.480

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.770
 northeast of electro or western 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.290

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.920

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.720
 main road out it was a blitzkrieg 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.020
 We are modest like the Germans 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.020
 the russians 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.150
 So we are locked 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.730
 203 without card owning a corpse will 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.730
 not ventilated 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.980
