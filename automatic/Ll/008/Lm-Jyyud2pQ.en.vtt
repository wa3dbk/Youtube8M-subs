be showing you how to manage and control
your<00:00:05.310> cellular<00:00:05.790> data<00:00:06.000> usage<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.690> your<00:00:07.170> device

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
your cellular data usage on your device

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.169 
your cellular data usage on your device
so<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.189> actually<00:00:08.460> pretty<00:00:08.610> simple<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
so it's actually pretty simple so you

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
so it's actually pretty simple so you
can<00:00:09.300> see<00:00:09.420> right<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:09.630> if<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:09.929> jump<00:00:10.170> into<00:00:10.410> our

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
can see right here if we jump into our

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
can see right here if we jump into our
settings<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.490> tap<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.880> cellular<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
settings and we tap on cellular and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.820 
settings and we tap on cellular and
we're<00:00:12.929> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> start<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> scroll<00:00:13.650> down<00:00:13.679> just

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
we're going to start to scroll down just

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.440 
we're going to start to scroll down just
a<00:00:14.219> bit<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
a bit and you can see that we start to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.689 
a bit and you can see that we start to
get<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> breakdown<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.260> our<00:00:16.800> usage<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.460> this

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
get a breakdown of our usage on this

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.250 
get a breakdown of our usage on this
device<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.449> our<00:00:18.570> call<00:00:18.750> time<00:00:19.020> right

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
device so we have our call time right

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
device so we have our call time right
here<00:00:19.529> right<00:00:20.039> below<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.699> our

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
here right below that we have our

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.150 
here right below that we have our
cellular<00:00:21.300> data<00:00:21.779> usage<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.830> current

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
cellular data usage so for this current

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
cellular data usage so for this current
period<00:00:23.490> i've<00:00:23.640> actually<00:00:23.789> used<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.420> point

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
period i've actually used two point

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.290 
period i've actually used two point
seven<00:00:25.230> gigabytes<00:00:25.800> now<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> actually<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
seven gigabytes now this is actually a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.670 
seven gigabytes now this is actually a
little<00:00:27.689> bit<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.170> I'll<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.529> in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
little bit off and I'll show you that in

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
little bit off and I'll show you that in
here<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> second<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.359> start<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
here just a second but if we start to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.179 
here just a second but if we start to
scroll<00:00:30.840> down<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.590> more<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
scroll down just a little bit more you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
scroll down just a little bit more you
can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.149> cellular<00:00:33.450> data

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
can see that we have our cellular data

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.530 
can see that we have our cellular data
usage<00:00:34.320> broken<00:00:34.770> down<00:00:34.920> by<00:00:35.550> specific

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
usage broken down by specific

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.979 
usage broken down by specific
applications<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
applications this is actually in

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
applications this is actually in
alphabetical<00:00:39.989> order<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.469> weather<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:41.129> here

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
alphabetical order the weather up here

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.040 
alphabetical order the weather up here
at<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> very<00:00:41.879> top<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
at the very top just because it has a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
at the very top just because it has a
space<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.920> before<00:00:44.219> its<00:00:44.340> name<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
space right before its name but you can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
space right before its name but you can
see<00:00:45.149> right<00:00:45.180> below<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.809> starts<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
see right below that starts with a and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
see right below that starts with a and
goes<00:00:47.070> through<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.489> applications<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
goes through all my applications now you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
goes through all my applications now you
can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.680> look<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.370> applications

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
can see if we look at these applications

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
can see if we look at these applications
you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.989> data<00:00:52.350> each<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you can see how much data each one of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
you can see how much data each one of
those<00:00:53.489> apps<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.030> used<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.809> weather<00:00:55.020> I've

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
those apps have used so for weather I've

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.860 
those apps have used so for weather I've
used<00:00:55.500> 594<00:00:56.370> kilobytes<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.480> scroll<00:00:57.690> down

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
used 594 kilobytes if we scroll down

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.450 
used 594 kilobytes if we scroll down
just<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> App<00:00:58.949> Store<00:00:59.280> has

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
just a bit you can see the App Store has

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
just a bit you can see the App Store has
used<00:00:59.760> 111<00:01:00.750> megabytes<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.280> mean<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> can

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
used 111 megabytes and I mean you can

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
used 111 megabytes and I mean you can
really<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.870> applications<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.830> are

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
really see the applications that are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
really see the applications that are
using<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.400> whole<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.820> Gmail<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.570> 130

order to manage these is actually toggle

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749 
order to manage these is actually toggle
off<00:01:27.659> these<00:01:28.049> applications<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.400> think

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
off these applications that you think

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
off these applications that you think
you<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.479> necessarily<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:32.369> be

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you don't really necessarily need to be

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
you don't really necessarily need to be
using<00:01:32.790> data<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.700> easily

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
using data and you can do so very easily

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
using data and you can do so very easily
just<00:01:36.240> by<00:01:36.570> tapping<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:37.650> toggles

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
just by tapping on one of these toggles

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
just by tapping on one of these toggles
just<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
just like that so if you don't want to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
just like that so if you don't want to
use<00:01:39.780> data<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.619> specific<00:01:41.100> app<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
use data for that specific app then you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
use data for that specific app then you
can<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.090> tap<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> toggle<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.619> one

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
can just tap that toggle off now one

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
can just tap that toggle off now one

itself<00:02:16.860> now<00:02:17.190> also<00:02:17.460> all<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> way<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.240> at

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
itself now also all the way down here at

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.900 
itself now also all the way down here at
the<00:02:18.450> bottom<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:18.960> see<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.590> have

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the bottom you can see that we have

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.190 
the bottom you can see that we have
system<00:02:20.910> services<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.080> I've

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
system services so you can see that I've

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.610 
system services so you can see that I've
used<00:02:22.910> 267<00:02:23.910> Meg's<00:02:24.180> right<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.410> tap

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
used 267 Meg's right there so if we tap

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.280 
used 267 Meg's right there so if we tap
on<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.460> can<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.640> how<00:02:27.120> much<00:02:27.390> each<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
on that you can see how much each of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.470 
on that you can see how much each of
these<00:02:28.530> system<00:02:29.250> applications<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.150> system

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
these system applications or system

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.020 
these system applications or system
services<00:02:31.020> how<00:02:31.890> much<00:02:32.040> data<00:02:32.280> each<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.910> those

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
services how much data each one of those

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.280 
services how much data each one of those
have<00:02:33.210> used<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.960> isn't<00:02:34.140> really

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have used now this isn't really

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.450 
have used now this isn't really
something<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:34.950> going<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.310> able

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
something that you're going to be able

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.030 
something that you're going to be able
to<00:02:35.610> toggle<00:02:36.360> off<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.600> only<00:02:37.050> way<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.860> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
to toggle off the only way to do so is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.910 
to toggle off the only way to do so is
by<00:02:38.300> completely<00:02:39.300> turning<00:02:39.600> off<00:02:39.840> data<00:02:40.230> which<00:02:40.680> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
by completely turning off data which is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.770 
by completely turning off data which is
a<00:02:40.950> little<00:02:41.340> bit<00:02:41.460> extreme<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> probably

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
a little bit extreme so I probably

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.630 
a little bit extreme so I probably
wouldn't<00:02:43.110> recommend<00:02:43.380> doing<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.550> you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
wouldn't recommend doing that now you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.310 
wouldn't recommend doing that now you
can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.820> down<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.570> actually<00:02:45.720> reset

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
can see down here you can actually reset

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.020 
can see down here you can actually reset
your<00:02:46.440> statistics<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.310> want<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.790> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
your statistics if you want to do that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.990 
your statistics if you want to do that
this<00:02:48.240> should<00:02:48.510> automatically<00:02:49.380> reset<00:02:50.340> every

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
this should automatically reset every

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.420 
this should automatically reset every
single<00:02:51.420> bill<00:02:52.170> period<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.250> see<00:02:53.400> right

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
single bill period but you can see right

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940 
single bill period but you can see right
here<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.970> mine<00:02:54.210> actually<00:02:54.780> didn't<00:02:55.290> reset

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
here that mine actually didn't reset

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.310 
here that mine actually didn't reset
last<00:02:56.250> month<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.330> actually<00:02:57.780> two

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
last month so this is actually two

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.920 
last month so this is actually two
months<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.860> data<00:02:59.730> right<00:03:00.120> here<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.690> wanted

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
months of data right here so if I wanted

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.240 
months of data right here so if I wanted
to<00:03:00.990> reset<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.650> would<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:01.920> tap<00:03:02.100> on

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
to reset that you would just tap on

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.640 
to reset that you would just tap on
reset<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.940> then<00:03:03.420> reset<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.960> statistics

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
reset and then reset your statistics

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230 
reset and then reset your statistics
right<00:03:04.950> there<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.640> can<00:03:05.760> start<00:03:06.090> over

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
right there and then you can start over

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.480 
right there and then you can start over
fresh<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.170> see<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:08.040> you're<00:03:08.220> using

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
on a daily or monthly basis right there

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
on a daily or monthly basis right there
