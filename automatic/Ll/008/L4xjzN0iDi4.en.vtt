product from my beauty haul that I did

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
product from my beauty haul that I did
so<00:00:11.309> I'm<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> color<00:00:12.809> 328<00:00:13.500> Sun<00:00:14.099> beige<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so I'm in the color 328 Sun beige and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.180 
so I'm in the color 328 Sun beige and
this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> size<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.529> didn't<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.859> how

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this is the size of it I didn't know how

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.040 
this is the size of it I didn't know how
small<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.730> until<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> actually<00:00:18.449> saw<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> in

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
small it was until I actually saw it in

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.540 
small it was until I actually saw it in
real<00:00:19.350> life<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> thought<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> would<00:00:20.220> show<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
real life so I thought I would show the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.849 
real life so I thought I would show the
comparison<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.570> gonna<00:00:22.050> apply<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.619> side

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
comparison I'm gonna apply one side

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980 
comparison I'm gonna apply one side
using<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.490> brush<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> other<00:00:24.300> side<00:00:24.539> using<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
using a brush and the other side using a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
using a brush and the other side using a
sponge<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.430> start<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.240> brush

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
sponge so let's start with the brush

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.990 
sponge so let's start with the brush
first<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.099> always<00:00:29.460> apply<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.880> foundation

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
first and I always apply my foundation

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.630 
first and I always apply my foundation
with<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.599> fingertips<00:00:31.289> directly<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.949> my<00:00:32.070> face<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
with my fingertips directly to my face I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
with my fingertips directly to my face I
don't<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.180> brushes<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:33.960> sponges<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
don't like to use brushes or sponges to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.959 
don't like to use brushes or sponges to
apply<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.340> feel<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.820> it's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
apply it because I just feel like it's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.479 
apply it because I just feel like it's
soaks<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.420> product<00:00:36.930> more<00:00:37.500> than<00:00:37.559> necessary<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
soaks up product more than necessary so

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
soaks up product more than necessary so
I'd<00:00:38.579> rather<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.600> face<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I'd rather it just be on my face and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
I'd rather it just be on my face and
kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> warm<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
kind of warm up so that way you can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.569 
kind of warm up so that way you can
spread<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.420> distribute<00:00:43.379> evenly<00:00:46.489> now<00:00:47.489> I'm

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
spread and distribute evenly now I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.029 
spread and distribute evenly now I'm
using<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.000> buffer<00:00:48.539> type<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.260> brush<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> I'm

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
using a buffer type of brush and I'm

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.090 
using a buffer type of brush and I'm
using<00:00:50.190> stippling<00:00:50.879> motions<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:52.829> tell<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
using stippling motions and to tell you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
using stippling motions and to tell you
the<00:00:53.250> truth<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> didn't<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.090> care<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the truth I didn't really care for the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
the truth I didn't really care for the
foundation<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> used<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> brush<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.399> prefer

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
foundation when I used a brush I prefer

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
foundation when I used a brush I prefer
a<00:00:56.969> sponge<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:58.800> know<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> don't

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
a sponge and I don't know why I don't

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
a sponge and I don't know why I don't
know<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.600> left<00:01:00.960> little

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
know if it's because it just left little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
know if it's because it just left little
streaks<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> foundation<00:01:02.809> but<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.989> do

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
streaks with this foundation but I do

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
streaks with this foundation but I do
love<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> finish<00:01:05.040> after<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.939> evenly

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
love the finish after it's all evenly

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.230 
love the finish after it's all evenly
distributed<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.560> my<00:01:07.860> face<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> warmed<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
distributed on my face and warmed up on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.899 
distributed on my face and warmed up on
my<00:01:09.360> skin<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.020> looks<00:01:10.350> beautiful<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
my skin it just looks beautiful and one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:12.920 
my skin it just looks beautiful and one
of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> reasons<00:01:12.390> why<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> love<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of the reasons why I love this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
of the reasons why I love this
foundation<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.430> looked<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> my

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
foundation was because it looked like my

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
foundation was because it looked like my
natural<00:01:15.540> skin<00:01:16.340> I'm<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.570> apply<00:01:18.750> more

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
natural skin I'm going to apply more

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
natural skin I'm going to apply more
foundation<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> areas<00:01:20.100> where<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.310> need

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
foundation in the areas where I need

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850 
foundation in the areas where I need
extra<00:01:20.880> coverage<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.689> tend<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.409> using

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
extra coverage I tend to do this using

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.950 
extra coverage I tend to do this using
the<00:01:23.070> brush<00:01:23.430> after<00:01:23.700> I've<00:01:24.030> applied<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.450> first

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the brush after I've applied my first

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
the brush after I've applied my first
layer<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.400> ahead<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
layer so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
layer so I'm just going to go ahead and
do<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.479> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
now I'm gonna go ahead and use my beauty

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.289 
now I'm gonna go ahead and use my beauty
sponge<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.280> other<00:01:42.400> side<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> face<00:01:43.090> I

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
sponge for the other side of the face I

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.240 
sponge for the other side of the face I
did<00:01:43.509> dampen<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.619> can<00:01:44.770> tell<00:01:44.979> by

did dampen it and you can tell by

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.370 
did dampen it and you can tell by
looking<00:01:45.280> at<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.939> product<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.450> very<00:01:46.810> runny

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
looking at the product it is very runny

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.680 
looking at the product it is very runny
but<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.710> love<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.460> fact<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.450> this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
but I love the fact that that this

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.899 
but I love the fact that that this
foundation<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.350> very<00:01:50.380> runny<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.100> tend<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.670> look

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
foundation is very runny I tend to look

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.240 
foundation is very runny I tend to look
for<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.330> for<00:01:52.750> all<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.320> foundations<00:01:53.950> I'm

noticing<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:55.270> only<00:01:55.659> foundation<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.470> got

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
noticing the only foundation that I got

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.560 
noticing the only foundation that I got
was<00:01:56.860> super<00:01:57.280> thick<00:01:57.580> would<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.240> covergirl

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
was super thick would be the covergirl

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
three in one but I just love the way it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.630 
three in one but I just love the way it
looks<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.720> more<00:02:02.080> running<00:02:02.830> liquid<00:02:03.310> like

that<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.640> had<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.269> my<00:02:55.480> videos<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:56.140> were
