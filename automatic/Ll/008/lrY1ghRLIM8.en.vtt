00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.440 
babak's much more better of course you
still<00:02:36.190> have<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> do<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.630> regular<00:02:39.450> bike

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
still have to do the regular bike

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.370 
still have to do the regular bike
fitting<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.050> when<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.260> big<00:02:41.470> fit<00:02:41.800> your<00:02:41.980> bike

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.870 
fitting and when you big fit your bike
you<00:02:44.380> still<00:02:44.710> have<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.460> fit<00:02:45.670> that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
you still have and you have to fit that

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.780 
you still have and you have to fit that
cleat<00:02:46.270> in<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.230> right<00:02:47.500> position<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> makes<00:02:48.580> the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
actual salt salt it's still the carbon

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.310 
actual salt salt it's still the carbon
millenium<00:03:26.410> three<00:03:26.770> which<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.910> basically<00:03:28.390> nylon

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.810 
with injected carbon however for 2013
you<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.320> there's<00:03:35.500> actual<00:03:35.800> carbon<00:03:36.580> right

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you that there's actual carbon right

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.150 
you that there's actual carbon right
around<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.390> cleat<00:03:37.780> area<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.920> adds

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
around that cleat area and it adds

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.850 
around that cleat area and it adds
stiffness<00:03:39.970> how<00:03:40.780> much<00:03:41.020> stiffness<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.620> believe

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
stiffness how much stiffness I believe

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.640 
stiffness how much stiffness I believe
it<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:43.060> go<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.270> see<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.660> America<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.170> think

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
it if you go to see the America I think

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.229 
it if you go to see the America I think
there's<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.400> five<00:03:46.120> percent<00:03:46.920> increase<00:03:48.239> in

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
there's like a five percent increase in

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.940 
there's like a five percent increase in
weight<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.720> stiffness<00:03:50.290> blah<00:03:50.620> blah<00:03:50.770> blah

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
weight to stiffness blah blah blah

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.030 
weight to stiffness blah blah blah
sounds<00:03:51.550> like<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> bunch<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.030> crap<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.830> think<00:03:53.830> it's

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
sounds like a bunch of crap I think it's

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.430 
sounds like a bunch of crap I think it's
it's<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.660> definitely<00:03:56.020> stiff

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
it's this this is definitely stiff

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.410 
it's this this is definitely stiff
enough<00:03:56.560> for<00:03:56.980> most<00:03:57.130> people<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.820> don't<00:03:57.850> think<00:03:58.150> you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
enough for most people I don't think you

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.990 
enough for most people I don't think you
need<00:03:58.540> more<00:03:58.840> stiffness<00:03:59.230> unless<00:03:59.910> you're<00:04:00.910> an

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
need more stiffness unless you're an

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.590 
need more stiffness unless you're an
elite<00:04:01.840> athlete<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.250> full<00:04:03.489> carbon<00:04:03.820> -<00:04:04.300> I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
elite athlete this is full carbon - I

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.810 
elite athlete this is full carbon - I
don't<00:04:05.350> feel<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.860> difference<00:04:06.220> between<00:04:06.400> this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
don't feel the difference between this

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.900 
don't feel the difference between this
and<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.620> carbon<00:04:08.620> injected<00:04:09.480> stuff<00:04:12.510> yeah<00:04:13.510> so

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
and that carbon injected stuff yeah so

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.630 
and that carbon injected stuff yeah so
they<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.110> distract<00:04:17.100> system<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:18.420> it's

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
they have a distract system this it's

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.979 
they have a distract system this it's
superior<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.850> most<00:04:21.090> other<00:04:21.390> products<00:04:21.900> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
superior to most other products like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.530 
superior to most other products like
this<00:04:22.320> let's<00:04:22.680> say<00:04:22.770> Giro<00:04:23.310> or<00:04:23.790> motion<00:04:24.360> mono

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
this let's say Giro or motion mono

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.320 
this let's say Giro or motion mono
whatever<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.980> do<00:04:26.460> think<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.770> shoe

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
whatever I do think that this the shoe

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.640 
whatever I do think that this the shoe
wraps<00:04:30.330> around<00:04:30.570> better<00:04:31.170> than<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.460> ma<00:04:32.670> vyx<00:04:33.650> it

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
wraps around better than the ma vyx it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.460 
wraps around better than the ma vyx it
uses<00:04:35.160> some<00:04:35.580> type<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.850> other<00:04:36.300> material<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:36.990> is

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
uses some type of other material that is

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.950 
uses some type of other material that is
similar<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.460> think<00:04:38.670> it's<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.090> synthetic

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
similar to I think it's a synthetic

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.940 
similar to I think it's a synthetic
leather<00:04:40.640> it's<00:04:41.640> plenty<00:04:42.480> stiff<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.440> wraps

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
leather it's plenty stiff it wraps

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.990 
leather it's plenty stiff it wraps
around<00:04:44.160> your<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.110> your<00:04:46.110> um<00:04:46.290> your<00:04:47.220> feet<00:04:47.520> so

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
around your the the your um your feet so

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.350 
around your the the your um your feet so
well<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.330> have<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.870> give<00:04:49.050> up<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.710> think<00:04:50.250> yeah<00:04:51.210> it's

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
well I have to give up I think yeah it's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.580 
well I have to give up I think yeah it's
my<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.840> my<00:04:51.930> favorite<00:04:52.410> shoe<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.770> both<00:04:53.010> and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
my it's my favorite shoe of both and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.340 
my it's my favorite shoe of both and
this<00:04:55.590> what<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.550> like<00:04:56.790> most<00:04:57.060> about<00:04:57.300> CD<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.050> is

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
this what I like most about CD and is
