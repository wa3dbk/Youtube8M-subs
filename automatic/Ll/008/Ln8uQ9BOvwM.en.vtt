compressor check on it I'm not gonna

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.059 
compressor check on it I'm not gonna
show<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.290> because<00:00:07.529> I've<00:00:07.770> already<00:00:07.859> got<00:00:07.980> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
show that because I've already got a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.190 
show that because I've already got a
video<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.820> needs<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:09.840> I'll<00:00:09.960> shut

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
video it needs to see that but I'll shut

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.940 
video it needs to see that but I'll shut
it<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:11.130> find<00:00:11.580> if<00:00:11.969> there<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> problem

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
it when I do find if there is a problem

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.650 
it when I do find if there is a problem
and<00:00:13.950> let's<00:00:14.910> kind<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> go<00:00:15.330> through<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and let's kind of go through the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.070 
and let's kind of go through the
diagnosis<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> where<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> start

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
diagnosis so where I'm going to start

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260 
diagnosis so where I'm going to start
with<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.039> take<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> front<00:00:20.970> cover

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
with now is to take off the front cover

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.740 
with now is to take off the front cover
here<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:23.269> disconnect<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> cold<00:00:26.640> pack<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.240> we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
here and disconnect the cold pack so we

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
here and disconnect the cold pack so we
can<00:00:27.900> disarm<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.500> ignition<00:00:29.250> system<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
can disarm the ignition system so this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
can disarm the ignition system so this
vehicle<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.330> start<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.140> fresh

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
vehicle will start I can do my fresh

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.040 
vehicle will start I can do my fresh
check<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.040> yeah<00:00:32.399> we'll<00:00:33.360> check<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.960> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
check but yeah we'll check back here in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.560 
check but yeah we'll check back here in
a<00:00:34.110> minute<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> maybe<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.790> might<00:00:36.059> show<00:00:36.540> you

a minute and maybe I might show you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
a minute and maybe I might show you
where<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> problem<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.820> we'll<00:00:38.820> figure

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
where the problem is and we'll figure

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500 
where the problem is and we'll figure
out<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.850> tapping<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
out where the tapping is going all that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.709 
out where the tapping is going all that
so<00:00:43.200> here's<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> demise<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.489> car<00:00:44.789> look<00:00:45.629> at

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so here's the demise of this car look at

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.369 
so here's the demise of this car look at
that<00:00:46.579> it's<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.640> drain<00:00:47.850> plug<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:49.550> then<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> can

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that it's a drain plug and then you can

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
that it's a drain plug and then you can
just<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.039> barely<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.480> know

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
just kind of barely just see it you know

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.860 
just kind of barely just see it you know
right<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:55.219> that's<00:00:56.219> parts<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.239> his<00:00:57.510> main

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
right there that's parts of his main

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
right there that's parts of his main
bearings<00:00:58.550> they're<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.850> out<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> car

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bearings they're going out so this car

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.329 
bearings they're going out so this car
is<00:01:02.370> screwed<00:01:03.059> once<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> oil<00:01:03.690> starts<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> drain

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is screwed once the oil starts to drain

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.390 
is screwed once the oil starts to drain
and<00:01:05.549> bring<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> oil<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> kind<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and bring the oil up that we can kind of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.030 
and bring the oil up that we can kind of
see<00:01:08.610> what's<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.240> inside<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.689> oil

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
see what's going on inside the oil

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000 
see what's going on inside the oil
it's<00:01:11.040> got<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.430> compression<00:01:11.760> because

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
it's got good compression because

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's got good compression because
everything<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> top<00:01:14.430> end<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> motor

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
everything in the top end of the motor

everything in the top end of the motor
is<00:01:15.090> still<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> bottom<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is still good but the bottom in the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.420 
is still good but the bottom in the
motor<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> joke<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.830> improper

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you know there's might be too much light

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
you know there's might be too much light
now<00:01:57.200> but<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> clean<00:02:01.950> pan<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.829> by

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
now but this it is a clean pan just by

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.150 
now but this it is a clean pan just by
moving<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.640> wall<00:02:05.850> around<00:02:06.649> it's<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> hard

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
moving the wall around it's kind of hard

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.330 
moving the wall around it's kind of hard
to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
to
