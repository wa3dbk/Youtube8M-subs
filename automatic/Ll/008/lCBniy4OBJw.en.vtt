hi guys thanks for watching this video

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi guys thanks for watching this video
right<00:00:02.490> now<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.700> are<00:00:02.879> gonna<00:00:02.970> run<00:00:03.480> out<00:00:03.600> clear<00:00:03.959> to

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
right now we are gonna run out clear to

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.410 
right now we are gonna run out clear to
clear<00:00:04.470> 172<00:00:05.420> to<00:00:06.420> Mach<00:00:06.660> 2<00:00:07.020> phase<00:00:07.470> 2<00:00:08.210> as<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.360> can

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
clear 172 to Mach 2 phase 2 as you can

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.330 
clear 172 to Mach 2 phase 2 as you can
see<00:00:09.630> here<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:09.960> have<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.349> airbag<00:00:10.889> warning

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
see here we have the airbag warning

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
see here we have the airbag warning
light<00:00:11.519> showing<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.750> also<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
light showing and we also have the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.430 
light showing and we also have the
service<00:00:14.309> light<00:00:14.670> showing<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.199> are

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
service light showing the two are

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
service light showing the two are
connected<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.580> we're<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
connected and what we're going to do is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.010 
connected and what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> use<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.869> iCore<00:00:19.560> soft<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:21.020> 907

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we're going to use the iCore soft I 907

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.200 
we're going to use the iCore soft I 907
multi<00:00:22.529> system<00:00:22.680> scan<00:00:23.160> tool<00:00:23.430> which<00:00:24.060> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
multi system scan tool which is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910 
multi system scan tool which is
currently<00:00:24.510> plugged<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.230> diagnostic

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
currently plugged into the diagnostic

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.630 
currently plugged into the diagnostic
port<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:28.010> we're<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> try<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.609> if

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
port and we're going to try and see if

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
port and we're going to try and see if
we<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.910> diagnose<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> fault<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we can diagnose the fault for this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.490 
we can diagnose the fault for this
airbag<00:00:32.189> might<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.610> another<00:00:32.759> -<00:00:33.030> yeah<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> first

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
airbag might be another - yeah so first

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
airbag might be another - yeah so first
of<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.920> we'll<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> we'll<00:00:35.550> click<00:00:36.120> into

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
of all what we'll do is we'll click into

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.410 
of all what we'll do is we'll click into
diagnose

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.680 
diagnose
I'm<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.809> select<00:00:40.110> obviously<00:00:40.770> Reynold

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.139 

now<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> clear<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.590> phase<00:00:47.280> 2<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.030> that's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
now it's a clear up to phase 2 so that's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
now it's a clear up to phase 2 so that's
what<00:00:48.390> we'll<00:00:48.539> select<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:51.079> select<00:00:52.079> manually

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
what we'll select and select manually

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
what we'll select and select manually
that<00:00:53.070> means<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.550> select<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.090> unit<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that means we can select which unit we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
that means we can select which unit we
want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.020> diagnose<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.980> our<00:00:56.460> case<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
want to diagnose in our case it's the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.799 
want to diagnose in our case it's the
airbag<00:00:57.750> pretensioners<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> we'll<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.780> we

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
airbag pretensioners so we'll see if we

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
airbag pretensioners so we'll see if we
can<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.050> some<00:01:01.199> fault<00:01:01.440> codes<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> we'll<00:01:04.979> click

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
can get some fault codes so we'll click

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.050 
can get some fault codes so we'll click

that gives us a better idea it looks

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.840 
that gives us a better idea it looks
like<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> connection<00:01:38.460> under<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
like it's a connection under the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.109 
like it's a connection under the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
tensioner circuit open circuit so again
it<00:01:49.259> looks<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.850> connected<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it looks like it's connected with the

it looks like it's connected with the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
connection underneath to see there so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
connection underneath to see there so
we'll<00:01:57.149> check<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
we'll check that out and it will be a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
we'll check that out and it will be a
case<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> putting<00:01:59.790> everything<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.180> together

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
case of putting everything back together

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789 
case of putting everything back together
hopefully<00:02:00.780> wouldn't<00:02:01.140> clear<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> codes<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
hopefully wouldn't clear the codes and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.039 
hopefully wouldn't clear the codes and
get<00:02:02.490> rid<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> airbag<00:02:03.149> warning<00:02:03.600> lights<00:02:03.810> but

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
get rid of the airbag warning lights but

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.039 
get rid of the airbag warning lights but
