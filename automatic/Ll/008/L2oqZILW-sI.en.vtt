00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
smaller so yeah how big is it do ya 660

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.350 
smaller so yeah how big is it do ya 660
blocks<00:00:30.250> volume<00:00:30.519> which<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.330> 11<00:00:31.929> by<00:00:32.230> 11<00:00:32.980> 1<00:00:33.580> by<00:00:34.030> 12

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
blocks volume which is 11 by 11 1 by 12

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.160 
blocks volume which is 11 by 11 1 by 12
5<00:00:34.629> by<00:00:35.110> 5<00:00:35.650> deep<00:00:36.780> six<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.920> six<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:40.870> five

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
5 by 5 deep six actually six not five

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.860 
5 by 5 deep six actually six not five
because<00:00:41.830> it's<00:00:41.979> not<00:00:42.129> this<00:00:42.280> oh<00:00:42.659> yeah

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
because it's not this oh yeah

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.590 
because it's not this oh yeah
and<00:00:44.620> as<00:00:45.519> you<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.210> see<00:00:46.269> it's<00:00:46.479> completely

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
and as you can see it's completely

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.009 
and as you can see it's completely
seamless<00:00:48.000> although<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.390> doesn't<00:00:49.629> work<00:00:49.869> on

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
seamless although it doesn't work on

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.250 
seamless although it doesn't work on
bucket<00:00:50.470> which<00:00:50.680> is<00:00:50.890> really<00:00:51.250> unfortunate<00:00:51.369> but

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bucket which is really unfortunate but

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.479 
bucket which is really unfortunate but
the<00:00:53.260> only<00:00:53.379> way<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.589> get<00:00:53.799> this<00:00:53.979> small<00:00:54.220> is

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
the only way to get this small is

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.460 
the only way to get this small is
actually<00:00:55.119> to<00:00:55.330> make<00:00:55.600> it<00:00:55.750> not<00:00:55.839> work<00:00:56.019> on<00:00:56.110> bucket

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
actually to make it not work on bucket

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.439 
actually to make it not work on bucket
because<00:00:56.559> otherwise<00:00:56.920> you'll<00:00:57.309> have<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.670> or<00:00:58.269> not

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
because otherwise you'll have to or not

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.180 
because otherwise you'll have to or not
have<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.900> I<00:00:58.960> haven't<00:00:59.229> really<00:00:59.619> found<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.949> way<00:00:59.979> to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
have to I haven't really found a way to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.380 
have to I haven't really found a way to
make<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:00.549> not<00:01:01.239> use<00:01:01.479> these<00:01:01.900> two<00:01:02.439> here<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.390> yeah

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
make it not use these two here so yeah

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.860 
make it not use these two here so yeah
yeah<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:06.640> ya<00:01:06.760> as<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.420> can<00:01:07.540> see<00:01:07.690> right<00:01:07.810> there

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
yeah see ya as you can see right there

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.620 
yeah see ya as you can see right there
it's<00:01:08.770> not<00:01:08.920> too<00:01:09.100> fast

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.910 

but<00:01:13.909> yeah<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.329> way<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.899> really<00:01:16.530> compact

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
but yeah the way to get really compact

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.980 
but yeah the way to get really compact
is

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.510 

mostly<00:01:20.990> not<00:01:21.200> fastness<00:01:21.920> or<00:01:22.429> whatever<00:01:24.490> yeah<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
mostly not fastness or whatever yeah and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.870 
mostly not fastness or whatever yeah and
maybe<00:01:25.729> we<00:01:25.899> should<00:01:26.899> show<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:27.560> Walker<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
maybe we should show this Walker and the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.370 
maybe we should show this Walker and the
wiring<00:01:29.649> yeah<00:01:32.109> see<00:01:33.109> ya

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
wiring yeah see ya

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.889 
wiring yeah see ya
the<00:01:33.619> schwarber<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.159> not<00:01:34.490> our<00:01:34.670> design<00:01:35.119> but<00:01:35.630> it's

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
the schwarber is not our design but it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.830 
the schwarber is not our design but it's
the<00:01:36.109> signed<00:01:36.319> by<00:01:36.469> a<00:01:36.500> guy<00:01:36.939> named<00:01:37.939> Oso<00:01:38.359> guinea<00:01:38.600> pig

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840

blue<00:01:49.880> right<00:01:50.420> here<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.349> swapper<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:53.149> it's

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
blue right here is the swapper and it's

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.669 
blue right here is the swapper and it's
really<00:01:53.840> small<00:01:54.140> actually<00:01:54.619> it's<00:01:55.429> not<00:01:55.549> too<00:01:55.789> big

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
really small actually it's not too big

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.959 
really small actually it's not too big
it's<00:01:57.679> not<00:01:57.829> really<00:01:58.129> small<00:01:58.369> but<00:01:59.379> yeah<00:02:00.969> basically

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
it's not really small but yeah basically

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.449 
it's not really small but yeah basically
it's<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.719> normal<00:02:02.840> tire<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.649> what<00:02:04.429> I

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
it's just a normal tire and all what I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.069 
it's just a normal tire and all what I
would<00:02:04.729> call<00:02:04.879> a<00:02:04.939> normal<00:02:05.060> time<00:02:05.479> at<00:02:05.629> least<00:02:05.810> and

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
would call a normal time at least and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.319 
would call a normal time at least and
then<00:02:07.450> generate<00:02:08.450> some<00:02:08.690> post<00:02:08.899> pulses<00:02:09.440> here

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
then generate some post pulses here

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.349 
then generate some post pulses here
every<00:02:11.329> how<00:02:11.930> many<00:02:12.109> is<00:02:12.260> that

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.359 
every how many is that

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.039 
every how many is that
4<00:02:14.359> 5<00:02:14.930> 10<00:02:15.500> ticks<00:02:15.859> it<00:02:16.459> generates<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.209> pole<00:02:17.450> poles

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
4 5 10 ticks it generates a pole poles

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.390 
4 5 10 ticks it generates a pole poles
want<00:02:18.440> occult<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.120> produce<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.359> Pistons

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
want occult and produce the Pistons

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800 
want occult and produce the Pistons
which<00:02:22.400> makes<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.019> really<00:02:24.019> awkward

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
which makes this really awkward

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.110 
which makes this really awkward
animation<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.019> door<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.470> yeah

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.080 

I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.890> make<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.069> unloading<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.910> this

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
I think I can make it unloading of this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.820 
I think I can make it unloading of this
I<00:02:33.300> won't<00:02:33.569> be<00:02:33.720> making<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.080> tutorial<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:36.050> yeah<00:02:37.050> do

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
I won't be making a tutorial but yeah do

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.570 
I won't be making a tutorial but yeah do

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
really here also a slow-mo slow-mo shops

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.010
