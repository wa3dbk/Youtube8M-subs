00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
plausible to to get something like that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.380 
plausible to to get something like that
and<00:01:56.259> i<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.219> story<00:01:57.610> mode<00:01:57.789> dlc<00:01:58.240> is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and i do think a a story mode dlc is

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.330 
and i do think a a story mode dlc is
long<00:01:58.689> overdue<00:01:59.140> now<00:01:59.530> whether<00:01:59.799> this<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.070> just

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
long overdue now whether this is just

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.179 
long overdue now whether this is just
going<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> be<00:02:00.549> a<00:02:00.610> simple<00:02:01.200> addition<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.350> GTA<00:02:02.740> 5

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
going to be a simple addition to GTA 5

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.160 
going to be a simple addition to GTA 5
or<00:02:03.490> an<00:02:03.610> actual<00:02:03.850> standalone<00:02:04.600> single-player

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
about ten minutes long and you can find

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.289 
about ten minutes long and you can find

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
it on YouTube for Grand Theft Auto two

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.660 
it on YouTube for Grand Theft Auto two
in<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.379> main<00:03:14.560> character<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.220> game<00:03:15.459> a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
in the main character of that game a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.330 
in the main character of that game a
real-life<00:03:16.150> promo<00:03:16.599> trailer<00:03:16.659> so<00:03:17.379> that's<00:03:18.099> what

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
real-life promo trailer so that's what

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.580 
real-life promo trailer so that's what
leads<00:03:18.519> me<00:03:18.669> to<00:03:18.819> believe<00:03:18.849> in<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.230> know<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
leads me to believe in in you know it

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.349 
leads me to believe in in you know it
just<00:03:20.919> it<00:03:21.129> just<00:03:21.370> seems<00:03:21.609> plausible<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.239> we

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
just it just seems plausible that we

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.420 
just it just seems plausible that we
could<00:03:22.540> get<00:03:22.690> something<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.709> GTA<00:03:24.069> 5

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
could get something like that for GTA 5

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.000 
could get something like that for GTA 5
of<00:03:24.730> course<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.389> do<00:03:26.379> got<00:03:26.530> some<00:03:26.650> evidence<00:03:26.739> to

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
of course so do got some evidence to

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.770 
of course so do got some evidence to
back<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.250> up<00:03:27.459> with<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:28.209> whole<00:03:28.329> trailer

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
back that up with the whole trailer

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.869 
back that up with the whole trailer
thing<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.440> fact<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.739> Shawn<00:03:30.040> fonteno<00:03:30.310> is

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
thing in the fact that Shawn fonteno is

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.420 
thing in the fact that Shawn fonteno is
more<00:03:31.720> or<00:03:31.810> less<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:32.109> reputable<00:03:32.470> source<00:03:32.650> since<00:03:33.280> he

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
more or less a reputable source since he

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.309 
more or less a reputable source since he
does<00:03:33.639> voice<00:03:33.909> work<00:03:34.180> for<00:03:34.389> rockstar<00:03:34.840> games<00:03:34.870> and

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
does voice work for rockstar games and

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.349 
does voice work for rockstar games and
he<00:03:35.379> does<00:03:35.650> work<00:03:35.949> for<00:03:35.980> them<00:03:36.310> essentially<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.120> uh

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
he does work for them essentially so uh

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.390 
he does work for them essentially so uh
with<00:03:38.079> all<00:03:38.409> that<00:03:38.620> sent<00:03:38.859> out<00:03:38.949> of<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.099> way<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> do

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
with all that sent out of the way I do
