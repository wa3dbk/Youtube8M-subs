00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
to face him out in twos Dragonite so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.710 
to face him out in twos Dragonite so
that<00:04:50.950> his<00:04:51.280> multi<00:04:51.700> skill<00:04:51.970> gets<00:04:52.150> broken<00:04:52.450> with

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
that his multi skill gets broken with

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.050 
that his multi skill gets broken with
the<00:04:52.810> shell<00:04:53.080> rocks<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.620> once<00:04:54.280> his<00:04:54.460> multi<00:04:54.820> skill

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
the shell rocks and once his multi skill

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.450 
the shell rocks and once his multi skill
is<00:04:55.150> broken<00:04:55.450> it's<00:04:55.930> over<00:04:56.260> for<00:04:56.470> him<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.010> his

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
is broken it's over for him so his

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.340 
is broken it's over for him so his
scissor<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:58.000> gonna<00:04:58.210> out<00:04:58.330> speed<00:04:58.630> my<00:04:58.780> Skarmory

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
scissor is gonna out speed my Skarmory

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.260 
scissor is gonna out speed my Skarmory
and<00:04:59.500> it's<00:04:59.770> me<00:04:59.950> up<00:05:00.100> with<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.490> superpower<00:05:01.000> which

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
and it's me up with a superpower which

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.470 
and it's me up with a superpower which
tells<00:05:01.540> me<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.900> he<00:05:02.140> is<00:05:02.320> running<00:05:02.590> max<00:05:02.950> beat<00:05:03.190> and

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
tells me that he is running max beat and

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.940 
tells me that he is running max beat and
usually<00:05:04.480> choice<00:05:04.750> guard<00:05:05.050> scissors<00:05:05.410> run<00:05:05.680> max

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
usually choice guard scissors run max

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.560 
usually choice guard scissors run max
speed<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.700> means<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.030> he's<00:05:07.330> logged

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
speed so this means that he's logged

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.690 
speed so this means that he's logged
into<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.590> superpower<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.340> he's<00:05:09.550> gonna

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
into the superpower and he's gonna

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.970 
into the superpower and he's gonna
switch<00:05:09.910> out<00:05:10.090> into<00:05:10.450> his<00:05:10.570> donphan<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.620> I'm<00:05:11.830> gonna

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
switch out into his donphan so I'm gonna

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.070 
switch out into his donphan so I'm gonna
predict<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.790> go<00:05:12.970> for<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.390> wall<00:05:13.630> vent<00:05:13.870> to

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
predict that and go for the wall vent to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.020 
predict that and go for the wall vent to
face<00:05:14.260> him<00:05:14.470> out<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.920> two<00:05:14.950> is<00:05:15.220> Dragonite<00:05:15.730> and

face him out in two is Dragonite and

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.300 
face him out in two is Dragonite and
this<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.420> what<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.660> wanted<00:05:17.200> because<00:05:17.410> it's<00:05:17.860> multi
