00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.990
 hey people things here today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.719
 with a review video for benq xl 27 20 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.509
 gaming monitor and yes most of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 you already know I had the xl 24 20 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.730
 It was a year in operation and he is 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 also really good 120 hertz display 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 and now I have the bigger version 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 of which now has 27 inches of the new the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 old 24 inch which already far 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 is enough to gamble but 27 inches is there 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 has another stage crass 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.660
 maybe I will be the one for 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 The consoles now use eg for the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 playstation 4 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.680
 Of course that will be really cool if you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.910
 then can sit back and relax 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.170
 a little further away and still 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.329
 enough draws on the big display 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 or I use it as a TV because 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 the rear has the hdmi connection speak 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 can directly your hdmi receiver 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.559
 plug in and watch TV immediately 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 and since he also has film mode and so on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 continue 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 Of course, the picture also comes with film 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 really good over but the monitor 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 Of course, not just the film mode 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 but also a fps mode and so on 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 but also by the way professional players like 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 held and so on helped 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.510
 to stop that that really 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.280
 is optimized for gaming and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.930
 among other things through the cooperation 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.220
 with the pro gamblers has banker 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.439
 simply creates certain advantages 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 compared to other 120 yards monitors too 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 offer and that's why 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 as on big events like the eps finals 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.750
 and the three mclaren and so on 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 official tournament monitor used 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.380
 so then again comes shortly to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.689
 the technical details resp 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.880
 the special gamer features and that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.840
 first data ms a reaction time so 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 Damn fast 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 which by the way also a very horny 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 features and very important for it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 gaming is the black equalizer at this 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 First thank you very much to mine 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.590
 avenge friend 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.299
 for the two example pictures here and we 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.950
 you can see the dark ones 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.450
 put on furs and you will see 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 just the opponents much better among the opponents 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.899
 trains on the train for example if you are 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.579
 now counter strike source game 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.899
 It may also be good that you are there 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.399
 as a daycare is planned if you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.689
 He has not actually seen 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.399
 was so easily visible to the others 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.869
 Incidentally, I have often felt the same way 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.490
 that the people for example just on 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.140
 filmed how could you have filmed 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.750
 see and so on and I think so 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.460
 only what do you think I have and stop 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.950
 black equalizer and as I said it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.759
 then hold decisive advantages match 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.710
 In addition, you still have a smart 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.030
 cache function that it is convenient for him 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.649
 with a touch of a button the resolution 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.000
 or for people he can fight for 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.920
 want to play sweden ran 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.150
 like most old 16 per gamer 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.530
 then he could do that if he did 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.569
 used to it time and that's how 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.160
 not said at some other monitor 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.140
 more possible because there is always the resolution 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.840
 it has to be full and that's it 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 very handy fps and rts monday yes 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.810
 already mentioned different modes 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 then adjust the colors, etc 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.860
 it's just a lot better for everything 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.450
 gaming is suitable then we still have 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 a controller down that it pretty much 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.819
 practically there you can also have three 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.290
 motives eg gamer 1.2 gamer 3 you can 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
 then click on the monitor change 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.530
 directly and turns on perfectly 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.360
 gaming for the game in question 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.069
 example I have for various games 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.569
 also other modes set and 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.700
 Of course we also have nvidia 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.200
 peace so you can play 3d games too 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.819
 gamble and so on and on the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.080
 I would like more technical details 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.069
 I'm not so sure right now 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.480
 I just grab the left 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.500
 description because you can everything exactly 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.819
 read it yourself 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.290
 and now we come to the most important 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.930
 part and it is in my opinion the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.269
 120 hertz that's really blatant if you 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.430
 that with 60 or 75 heart or what else 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.049
 everything compares yes it is a world 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.130
 I distinguished for example could 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.720
 never again with a 60 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.220
 play heart monitor because then I 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.930
 simply these streak in the middle and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.340
 this steering is much more true yes 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 that has the addiction factor, so to speak 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
 if you once with 120 hertz display 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.709
 has played since you first realize what 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.299
 had waived all the time to me 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.410
 At that time I was in mine 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.570
 friend or 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.160
 on a long test and then 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.049
 I thought okay, I need too 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.790
 one is no question that is easy 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.859
 such a stark difference and the benches 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.750
 monitor offers not only the 120th 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.130
 yards like some other monitors but 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.660
 It also offers other gaming features 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.760
 and that's why it is in the said 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.320
 gaming area definitely the first choice 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.120
 besides, I also have one myself 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.850
 small programs career behind me me 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.190
 have eg for snow card so newco player 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.750
 played in the eps and in the past 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.850
 and of course I was also flyer events 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.010
 with the copenhagen games the max long in 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.350
 France and the Alps in Austria 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 and so on and as I said 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.590
 also the certain experience in principle 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.090
 you can also with bad gamer 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.260
 hardware already be reasonably well 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.640
 maybe bring a good mouse 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.840
 Of course, advantages 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.790
 I already have some reviews 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.350
 on a panel but still mine 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.209
 opinion is the very first thing one 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 should get 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.690
 120 hertz display because just this 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.459
 steering and these are streaking in the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.019
 are middle way and that much more fluid 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.940
 is just when you are the good pc 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.940
 have and in any game over me 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.919
 Has 120 fps or even more best 240 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.600
 then the game runs so smoothly 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.860
 believed more 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.360
 yes and now again on the heart 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.950
 if I you really a gaming 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.450
 monitor with 120 years recommended 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.650
 would then only the bank because he 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.360
 just a lot of other features 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.920
 offers and it does not work 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.510
 in vain as good as any professional player 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.560
 with a good last I can 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.240
 actually only say it works 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.680
 really super fluid and looks 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.330
 just really cool and the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.280
 Incidentally, color contrasts are also cool 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.290
 So I can only monitor the monitor 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.360
 by the way, he also looks really good 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.920
 So I think a stylish design 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.990
 but it is a matter of taste logically 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.490
 and now again one to all of you 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.160
 you who have complained a banking 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.870
 be it the 27 inch version or 24 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.550
 inches is left to write yours 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.110
 opinion in the comments what yours 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.430
 experience with that is what people are doing 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.680
 not only hear from me but also from 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.390
 other that it is really worthwhile and 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.490
 a great investment for gaming is 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.530
 and yes, as I said Mr. van looks at you 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.870
 the gameplays are subscribed to my channel 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.230
 Write comments the video what too 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.790
 always 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.480
 thanks for watching until next 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.480
 times people skin in
