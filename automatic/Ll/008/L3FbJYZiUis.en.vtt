to hold the braids tight mm-hmm you can

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.280 
to hold the braids tight mm-hmm you can
also<00:01:48.710> use<00:01:49.159> various<00:01:50.090> products<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:50.690> gel<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
also use various products like gel and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.370 
also use various products like gel and
stuff<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:51.710> one<00:01:51.920> doesn't<00:01:52.100> have<00:01:52.220> gel<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:54.170> then

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
stuff this one doesn't have gel but then

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.550 
stuff this one doesn't have gel but then
you<00:01:54.500> could<00:01:54.680> wet<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:55.700> know<00:01:55.820> braid<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.240> wet<00:01:56.509> hair

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
you could wet you know braid on wet hair

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.020 
you could wet you know braid on wet hair
which<00:01:57.560> would<00:01:57.740> be<00:01:57.920> tighter<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.670> then<00:01:58.880> you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
which would be tighter and then you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.060 
which would be tighter and then you
could<00:01:59.210> use<00:01:59.360> gel<00:01:59.750> which<00:02:00.530> would<00:02:00.710> make<00:02:00.890> it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
could use gel which would make it

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.029 
could use gel which would make it
tighter<00:02:01.280> because<00:02:01.550> wet<00:02:01.970> hair<00:02:02.470> stretches<00:02:03.470> more

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
tighter because wet hair stretches more

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.850 
tighter because wet hair stretches more
but<00:02:04.850> sometimes<00:02:05.390> making<00:02:05.720> tight<00:02:06.140> braids<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.679> not

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
but sometimes making tight braids is not

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.729 
but sometimes making tight braids is not
so<00:02:07.100> good<00:02:07.310> because<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.789> client<00:02:08.360> cannot<00:02:09.259> smile

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
so good because this client cannot smile

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.650 
so good because this client cannot smile
well<00:02:10.459> if<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.729> want<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> give<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> client<00:02:11.600> a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
well if you want to give a client a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.100 
well if you want to give a client a
facelift<00:02:12.230> yeah<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.220> could<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.730> that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.290 

but<00:02:18.110> then<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.410> client<00:02:18.920> cannot<00:02:19.280> smile<00:02:19.760> it's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
but then that client cannot smile it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.449 
but then that client cannot smile it's
uncomfortable<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.590> then<00:02:21.860> sometimes<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.340> get

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
uncomfortable and then sometimes you get
