00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
but in practice it just feels like a

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.159 
but in practice it just feels like a
gimmick<00:06:07.699> at<00:06:08.000> lower<00:06:08.360> levels<00:06:08.750> they<00:06:08.900> seemed<00:06:09.110> like

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
gimmick at lower levels they seemed like

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.510 
gimmick at lower levels they seemed like
any<00:06:09.409> other<00:06:09.620> MMO<00:06:10.039> pet
