00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.069
 look here sect nothing a 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.800
 now eat you must be perplexed 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.019
 why did you put the pyramids on 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 depth of 700 meters under the ice 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.070
 this is the first of all the pyramids built 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.070
 this game is worth the candle 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.630
 the tunnel is exactly at an angle of 30 degrees here 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.340
 it can be seen clearly yesterday there was no 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.340
 nothing go down there and look 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.970
 only favorites can enter they gave away 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.540
 a life 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.820
 to start hunting like ribs 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.030
 brought from the inside as if something broke out 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.030
 out 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 Look at it 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.220
 at the top 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.220
 stand no 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 first cycle 1 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320
 what's next 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.149
 very similar to rats select 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.510
 chest up hunters 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.580
 dropping x and 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.580
 we are like cattle to them 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.150
 war involves us and we must choose smart 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 we cannot allow 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:58.350
 to go whether 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 because then our civilization is the end
