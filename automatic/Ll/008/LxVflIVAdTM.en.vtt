00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.849
 use for both daytime and 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.560
 evening manicure nail design 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.410
 uncomplicated basically it's a gradient 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.929
 transition from one color to another also 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.849
 animal prints that we give you 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.550
 Be sure to show the following videos 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.160
 before design 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.530
 stretch the circus go on to point i 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.280
 I use a disinfectant for 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.850
 nails 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.789
 otupy carefully with us 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.620
 sponzhikom remove residues and disinfector 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.590
 with nails and then apply a base 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.840
 a coating that protects the nails from 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.789
 penetration of coloring pigments we 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.660
 accordingly , you will not turn yellow 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.570
 after removing the design as the base 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.540
 cover i will use cover 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.540
 crayons at bytes from the company color club 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.369
 be sure to wait until you have 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.350
 base coating it completely dry 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.659
 must be completely firm not 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.359
 smear as we continue 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.340
 we will stick with you on the nails 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.990
 Here is such a 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.759
 self-adhesive tape can choose 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.979
 any color she doesnâ€™t give us any further 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.939
 come in handy after doing the design we 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.289
 we shall take this ribbon with you carefully 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:44.409
 detach the tip of the ribbon 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.179
 basis of the disk itself and then randomly 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.989
 in on 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:55.200
 on to. distribute the ribbon sticking 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.200
 I make lines far and wide 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.690
 leave small tails already for on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:22.790
 to the points so that later it would be easier for you 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 remove after you have stuck them 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.890
 one more time go through all the years. 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.800
 check that they are very carefully 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.740
 glued to the coil then we are with you 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.610
 will apply 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.410
 The resulting varnish colors are different and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 will not be very beautiful if one color 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.510
 will flow into the other that's how you 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.660
 see I already glued a strip 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.140
 self adhesive on everything on to point now i'm 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.690
 I will pick colors varnishes today 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 we will be manicure in such calm 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.350
 uncomfortable shades so I picked up 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:11.900
 Lakin from the color club collection is a number 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:16.040
 10 10 10 07 1 thousand 1004 and 917 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.170
 selected shade to any area on 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.650
 any part on ko. 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.130
 apply gently varnish and I apply 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.640
 just two of these small areas 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.350
 then you will see why I do it for 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.350
 stripes try not to go out 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:48.040
 then take the next shade and also 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.650
 put on 2 separated 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.650
 leg parts . 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.319
 after applying, be sure to give 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.959
 lacquer dry to dry 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:23.480
 save time you can apply one 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.030
 color immediately on everything on to the point if you 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.380
 you get a nail polish 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.610
 then you can be neatly 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.610
 corrector forces marriage 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.590
 and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.650
 after the varnish is completely dry 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.970
 the last strip you stuck 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 start shooting with coating and also in 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:03.810
 the same sequence starting from 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.810
 end clean the stripes neatly 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.919
 such a design is obtained in style 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.919
 mosaics of gentle tones 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.200
 after removing adhesive tapes 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.170
 carefully with the help of the corrector clean 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.360
 without varnish that got on your skin 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.170
 neatly without getting on myself 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.220
 drawing us on to the point also wanted 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.500
 tell you what you can 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.360
 experiment for example do 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.030
 base opaque 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.400
 She is an example of some dark 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.300
 in a contrasting color suppose it can 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.620
 be black then you will have more 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:18.160
 an explicit picture of such a design with us 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.440
 turned out and be sure to fix it 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.350
 topcoat as top 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.890
 cover i will use the top 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:32.820
 coating from the color club which makes 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:35.220
 more intense saturated colored 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.100
 lucky 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:44.020
 it's thick enough but at the same time 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:49.110
 lays very well and holds well 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.110
 colors don't let them fade in the sun 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.660
 completion of the procedure after drying 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:00.690
 top oil on cuticle and around 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.240
 Come on. 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:08.040
 leave it for a few seconds and then 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:13.690
 gently rub into the skin around the nail and 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.690
 even in the cover itself so you will have 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.780
 more finished look of your work more 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.780
