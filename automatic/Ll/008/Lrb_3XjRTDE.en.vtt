00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
just one hit the destroyit which is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.720 
just one hit the destroyit which is
pretty<00:00:48.020> cool<00:00:48.260> definitely<00:00:49.100> good<00:00:49.250> for<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.580> know

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
pretty cool definitely good for you know

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.870 
pretty cool definitely good for you know
creating<00:00:50.300> stuff<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:52.040> little<00:00:52.220> block<00:00:52.640> is

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
creating stuff and the little block is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.270 
creating stuff and the little block is
um<00:00:53.270> an<00:00:53.480> eight<00:00:53.720> by<00:00:53.960> eight<00:00:54.170> by<00:00:54.410> eight<00:00:54.590> that's

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
um an eight by eight by eight that's

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.510 
um an eight by eight by eight that's
what<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.490> takes<00:00:55.580> up<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.040> one<00:00:58.280> eighth

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
what it takes up and so it's one eighth

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.200 
what it takes up and so it's one eighth
of<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.180> normal<00:00:59.450> size<00:00:59.630> and<00:00:59.660> length<00:01:00.080> it's<00:01:00.680> 1<00:01:01.210> 512

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
of the normal size and length it's 1 512

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.070 
of the normal size and length it's 1 512
a<00:01:02.570> little<00:01:03.560> more<00:01:03.770> cubic<00:01:04.369> sighs<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.119> that's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
a little more cubic sighs so that's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.350 
a little more cubic sighs so that's
pretty<00:01:06.290> cool<00:01:06.380> now<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.100> can<00:01:07.520> craft<00:01:07.850> all<00:01:08.090> kinds

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
pretty cool now you can craft all kinds

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.060 
pretty cool now you can craft all kinds
of<00:01:08.450> things<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.720> those<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.020> know<00:01:09.140> over<00:01:09.890> here

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
of things with those you know over here

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.190 
of things with those you know over here
we<00:01:10.189> got<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.369> nice<00:01:10.609> little<00:01:10.880> hut<00:01:11.149> I<00:01:11.420> made<00:01:11.990> out<00:01:12.079> of

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
we got a nice little hut I made out of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.050 
we got a nice little hut I made out of
the<00:01:12.289> wood<00:01:12.590> Angelica<00:01:13.189> says<00:01:13.429> it's<00:01:13.789> just<00:01:13.939> a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
the wood Angelica says it's just a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.109 
the wood Angelica says it's just a
one-hit<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.780> one-hit<00:01:15.649> destroyed<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.310> this

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
one-hit a one-hit destroyed and this

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.550 
one-hit a one-hit destroyed and this
also<00:01:17.299> works<00:01:17.539> with<00:01:17.719> redstone<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.350> let's<00:01:18.469> go

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
also works with redstone so let's go

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.050 
also works with redstone so let's go
ahead<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.740> use<00:01:19.039> this<00:01:19.189> one<00:01:19.369> redstone<00:01:19.700> real

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
ahead and use this one redstone real

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.969 
ahead and use this one redstone real
quick<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.960> if<00:01:21.079> you<00:01:21.170> pledge<00:01:21.409> residence

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
quick so if you pledge residence

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.429 
quick so if you pledge residence
miniature<00:01:22.399> then<00:01:23.359> go<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.749> place<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> switch

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
miniature then go and place a switch

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.069 
miniature then go and place a switch
it's<00:01:24.710> also<00:01:24.950> manager<00:01:25.609> but<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.569> won't<00:01:26.780> work

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
it's also manager but this won't work

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.730 
it's also manager but this won't work
from<00:01:27.710> this<00:01:28.520> won't<00:01:28.850> work<00:01:29.090> as<00:01:29.359> as<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.530> what's

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
from this won't work as as I what's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.620 
from this won't work as as I what's
called<00:01:30.979> piston<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.670> would<00:01:31.880> place<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> piston

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
called piston you would place a piston

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.260 
called piston you would place a piston
on<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.259> will<00:01:33.469> not<00:01:33.710> work<00:01:33.740> if<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.909> red<00:01:35.060> still

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
on it it will not work if the red still

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.489 
on it it will not work if the red still
don't<00:01:35.420> work<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.020> not<00:01:36.139> actually<00:01:36.409> going

don't work but it's not actually going

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:37.959 
don't work but it's not actually going
to<00:01:36.619> move<00:01:36.889> the<00:01:37.009> piston<00:01:37.189> if<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:37.700> want<00:01:37.850> the

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
to move the piston if you want the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.510 
to move the piston if you want the
piston<00:01:38.389> to<00:01:38.600> move<00:01:38.859> actually<00:01:39.859> to<00:01:39.950> place<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.429> in

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
piston to move actually to place it in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.849 
piston to move actually to place it in
real<00:01:40.969> size<00:01:40.999> and<00:01:41.569> you<00:01:42.079> get<00:01:42.259> your<00:01:42.380> dental<00:01:42.530> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.510 
move work standing for like an iron
doors<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:45.979> works<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.280> same<00:01:46.310> way

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
doors like that it works the same way

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.940 
doors like that it works the same way
but<00:01:47.389> the<00:01:47.810> great<00:01:48.020> thing<00:01:48.049> about<00:01:48.259> having<00:01:48.499> this

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
but the great thing about having this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.550 
but the great thing about having this
miniature<00:01:49.310> like<00:01:49.729> redstone<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:50.749> you<00:01:51.229> can<00:01:51.380> make

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
miniature like redstone is you can make

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.649 
miniature like redstone is you can make
circuits<00:01:52.069> that<00:01:52.189> are<00:01:52.280> small<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:53.359> way<00:01:53.600> you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
circuits that are small this way you

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.139 
circuits that are small this way you
know<00:01:53.810> instead<00:01:54.319> of<00:01:54.409> having<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.799> circuit<00:01:55.280> take<00:01:55.969> up

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
know instead of having a circuit take up

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.569 
know instead of having a circuit take up
this<00:01:56.270> entire<00:01:56.600> open<00:01:57.319> area<00:01:57.709> it<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.399> just<00:01:58.520> take

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
this entire open area it will just take

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.969 
this entire open area it will just take
up<00:01:58.850> one<00:01:59.149> little<00:01:59.420> block<00:01:59.780> area<00:02:00.109> which<00:02:00.740> will<00:02:00.889> be

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
up one little block area which will be

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.279 
up one little block area which will be
great<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.280> continue<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.119> make<00:02:02.270> very<00:02:02.569> like

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
great to continue to make very like

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.739 
great to continue to make very like
intricate<00:02:03.950> circuits<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.029> take<00:02:05.329> up<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.569> lot<00:02:05.689> of

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
intricate circuits that take up a lot of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.080 
intricate circuits that take up a lot of
space<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:06.319> now<00:02:06.439> minimize<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.249> and<00:02:07.369> takes

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
space you can now minimize it and takes

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.240 
space you can now minimize it and takes
up<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.390> know<00:02:08.509> maybe<00:02:08.840> only<00:02:09.050> one<00:02:09.440> or<00:02:09.470> two<00:02:09.649> blocks

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
up you know maybe only one or two blocks

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.220 
up you know maybe only one or two blocks
which<00:02:10.880> would<00:02:11.000> be<00:02:11.090> pretty<00:02:11.390> awesome<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:11.959> people

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
which would be pretty awesome for people

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.860 
which would be pretty awesome for people
that<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.680> good<00:02:13.220> with<00:02:13.490> reno<00:02:13.879> music<00:02:14.269> redstone<00:02:14.659> i

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
that are good with reno music redstone i

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.559 
that are good with reno music redstone i
myself<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.709> pretty<00:02:15.890> bad<00:02:16.040> at<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.610> i<00:02:16.879> don't

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
myself in pretty bad at so i don't

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.180 
myself in pretty bad at so i don't
usually<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:18.290> stuff<00:02:18.319> for<00:02:18.620> us<00:02:18.860> down

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
usually do stuff for us down

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.010 
usually do stuff for us down
but<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.270> you're<00:02:20.390> glad<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.990> make

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
but you know if you're glad you can make

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.740 
but you know if you're glad you can make
like<00:02:21.530> nice<00:02:21.830> really<00:02:22.310> awesome<00:02:22.490> things<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
like nice really awesome things and you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750 
like nice really awesome things and you
know<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.020> are<00:02:24.110> nice<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:24.830> small<00:02:25.250> offer<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
know that are nice and small offer the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.940 
know that are nice and small offer the
things<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.150> noted<00:02:26.630> do<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.960> work<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.680> so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
things I noted do not work with this so

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.140 
things I noted do not work with this so
you<00:02:28.010> go<00:02:28.160> ahead<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.310> place<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.520> accounting

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you go ahead and place the accounting

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.360 
you go ahead and place the accounting
manager<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:30.290> miniature<00:02:30.680> but<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.130> can

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
manager on it it's miniature but you can

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.550 
manager on it it's miniature but you can
actually<00:02:31.520> use<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.090> craft<00:02:32.390> anything<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.530> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
actually use it to craft anything so I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.110 
actually use it to craft anything so I
mean<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:33.920> use<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.280> decoration<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
mean you can just use for decoration and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.840 
mean you can just use for decoration and
a<00:02:35.750> furnace<00:02:36.170> II<00:02:36.290> place<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.650> furnace<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.280> won't

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
a furnace II place of furnace it won't

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.180 
a furnace II place of furnace it won't
actually<00:02:38.030> place<00:02:38.600> well<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> can<00:02:39.920> place

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
actually place well as you can place

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.410 
actually place well as you can place
rails<00:02:40.570> but<00:02:41.570> if<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.720> place<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.260> card<00:02:42.710> on<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
rails but if you place a card on it it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170 
rails but if you place a card on it it
or<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.720> would<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:44.960> place<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.740> door<00:02:46.460> it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
or not it would actually place a door it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.780 
or not it would actually place a door it
won't<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.630> won't<00:02:47.690> place<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.500> assign<00:02:49.370> you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
won't it won't place it all assign you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.580 
won't it won't place it all assign you
can<00:02:49.970> place<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.900> not<00:02:51.110> actually<00:02:51.380> there

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
can place it but it's not actually there

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.680 
can place it but it's not actually there
so<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.430> basically<00:02:52.610> if<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.090> my<00:02:53.240> guys<00:02:53.480> it's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
so that's basically if it's my guys it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.200 
so that's basically if it's my guys it's
definitely<00:02:54.140> great<00:02:54.440> for<00:02:55.400> building<00:02:55.580> things<00:02:55.760> you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
definitely great for building things you

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.330 
definitely great for building things you
know<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.720> make<00:02:56.810> pixel<00:02:57.230> art<00:02:57.350> now<00:02:57.560> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
know you can make pixel art now that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
know you can make pixel art now that
would<00:02:58.580> take<00:02:58.820> up<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.180> know<00:02:59.300> maybe<00:02:59.480> you<00:03:00.260> can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
would take up you know maybe you can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440 
would take up you know maybe you can
make<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.650> nice<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.250> big<00:03:01.640> pixel<00:03:02.180> art<00:03:02.270> from

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
make a nice really big pixel art from

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.990 
make a nice really big pixel art from
like<00:03:02.630> here<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.770> mountain<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.550> little

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
like here to that mountain a little

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030 
like here to that mountain a little
mountain<00:03:05.450> over<00:03:05.570> there<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.380> have<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> all

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
mountain over there and you have it all

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.160 
mountain over there and you have it all
kinds<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.940> know<00:03:08.060> really<00:03:08.300> intricate<00:03:08.840> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
kinds of you know really intricate and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.960 
kinds of you know really intricate and
the<00:03:09.740> really<00:03:09.920> neat<00:03:10.100> designs<00:03:10.460> instead<00:03:10.880> of

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
the really neat designs instead of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.090 
the really neat designs instead of
having<00:03:11.210> like<00:03:11.900> normal<00:03:12.260> sized<00:03:12.440> blocks<00:03:12.800> that

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
having like normal sized blocks that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.310 
having like normal sized blocks that
would<00:03:13.220> take<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:13.880> much<00:03:13.940> space<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.260> you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
would take up so much space that now you

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.650 
would take up so much space that now you
can<00:03:15.590> make<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.800> nice<00:03:16.100> little<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.850> know<00:03:17.000> awesome

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
can make a nice little you know awesome

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.970 
can make a nice little you know awesome
pixel<00:03:18.020> art<00:03:18.140> stuff<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:18.800> if<00:03:18.860> you're

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
pixel art stuff like that so if you're

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.320 
pixel art stuff like that so if you're
good<00:03:19.100> with<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.220> kind<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.520> stuff<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:20.150> is

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
good with that kind of stuff this is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.850 
good with that kind of stuff this is
definitely<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.470> great<00:03:21.650> for

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
definitely for you it's great for
