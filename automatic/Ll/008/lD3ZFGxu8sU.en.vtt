00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.800 
about it falling off or anything that's
like<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:20.909> problems<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.420> bikinis

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
like one of my problems with bikinis

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
like one of my problems with bikinis
they<00:01:21.930> always<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> fall<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.400> stuff<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.210> I

they always like fall off and stuff so I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840 
they always like fall off and stuff so I
really<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.350> modesty<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.670> good

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
really really think modesty is a good

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
really really think modesty is a good
thing<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.420> used<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.840> wear<00:01:27.990> bikinis<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
thing I mean I used to wear bikinis and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
thing I mean I used to wear bikinis and
all<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.829> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> stuff<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
all that kind of stuff and be like that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
all that kind of stuff and be like that
but<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.520> taught<00:01:32.790> myself<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but I really really taught myself that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
but I really really taught myself that
that<00:01:33.450> isn't<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:35.009> thing<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that isn't the good thing to do you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
that isn't the good thing to do you
should<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.659> covered<00:01:37.350> up

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
should be a little more covered up

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.899 
should be a little more covered up
because<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.400> wearing<00:01:38.670> broad

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because it's like wearing broad

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.109 
because it's like wearing broad
underwear<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.159> how<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.400> feel<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
underwear and that's just how i feel and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
underwear and that's just how i feel and
and<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:44.189> feel<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.640> body's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
