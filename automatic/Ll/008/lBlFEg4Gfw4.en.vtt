00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.089 
really come down and that's a big
indicator<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:16.290> exactly<00:02:16.799> where<00:02:16.889> I'm

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
indicator that I'm exactly where I'm

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.970 
indicator that I'm exactly where I'm
supposed<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> continuing<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.829> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
supposed to be and continuing to that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.069 
supposed to be and continuing to that
get<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.519> number<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.879> just<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.239> lower<00:02:21.480> my

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
get that number to just get lower my

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.989 
get that number to just get lower my
blood<00:02:22.409> pressure<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.889> better<00:02:23.159> my<00:02:23.400> pulse<00:02:23.760> is

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
blood pressure is better my pulse is

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.589 
blood pressure is better my pulse is
better<00:02:25.549> everything<00:02:26.549> has<00:02:26.909> gotten<00:02:27.090> better<00:02:27.359> as<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
better everything has gotten better as a

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.050 
better everything has gotten better as a
result<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:28.139> the<00:02:28.200> weight<00:02:28.349> loss<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:29.069> today<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.849> got

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
result of the weight loss so today I got

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.009 
result of the weight loss so today I got
put<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:31.069> stage<00:02:32.069> three<00:02:32.519> diet<00:02:32.819> which<00:02:33.540> means<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
put on stage three diet which means I

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.119 
put on stage three diet which means I
eat<00:02:34.230> actual<00:02:34.709> food<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:36.239> I'm<00:02:36.569> eating<00:02:37.169> soft<00:02:37.739> food

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
because it's kind of a lot of people

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.479 
because it's kind of a lot of people
don't<00:03:00.540> tolerate<00:03:00.719> it<00:03:01.079> well<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.500> even<00:03:02.069> chicken

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
guess is gonna be a part of it because

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.830 
guess is gonna be a part of it because

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
you cannot drink and eat at the same

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.920 
you cannot drink and eat at the same
time<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.590> have<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.889> wait<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:51.120> drink<00:04:51.419> after

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
time and you have to wait to drink after

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.559 
time and you have to wait to drink after
you<00:04:52.080> eat<00:04:52.319> for<00:04:52.650> at<00:04:52.740> least<00:04:52.919> 30<00:04:53.310> minutes<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.360> I

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
you eat for at least 30 minutes so I

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.080 
you eat for at least 30 minutes so I
just<00:04:54.990> felt<00:04:55.319> like<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.860> was<00:04:56.069> up<00:04:56.310> here<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:56.970> know

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
just felt like it was up here you know

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.589 
just felt like it was up here you know
like<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.599> is<00:04:57.780> where<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.169> food<00:04:58.319> was<00:04:58.819> and<00:04:59.819> it

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
like this is where the food was and it

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.260 
like this is where the food was and it
was<00:05:01.289> really<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.860> uncomfortable<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:03.000> I

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
was really really uncomfortable so I

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.020 
was really really uncomfortable so I
learned<00:05:04.139> that<00:05:04.319> lesson<00:05:04.560> very<00:05:05.039> quickly<00:05:05.419> I<00:05:06.419> just

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
learned that lesson very quickly I just

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.909 
learned that lesson very quickly I just
scrambled<00:05:09.030> some<00:05:09.509> egg<00:05:09.810> beaters<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.319> a<00:05:10.650> little

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
scrambled some egg beaters and a little

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.770 
scrambled some egg beaters and a little
cheese<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.550> some<00:05:11.789> some<00:05:12.030> chopped<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:12.599> tomato

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
cheese and some some chopped up tomato

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.180 
cheese and some some chopped up tomato
and<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:15.000> made<00:05:15.930> what<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.199> thought<00:05:16.259> was<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> really

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
and I made what I thought was a really

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.659 
and I made what I thought was a really
small<00:05:17.460> portion<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.530> couple<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.770> bites<00:05:19.979> into

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
small portion and a couple of bites into

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.649 
small portion and a couple of bites into
it<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:22.490> I'm<00:05:23.490> full<00:05:23.909> it's<00:05:24.800> crazy<00:05:26.210> but<00:05:27.210> I'm<00:05:27.360> full

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.680 
it and I'm full it's crazy but I'm full
