00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 In a home where the pitcher is delicious and not burning 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.110
 But if it is fish grilled, it can be grilled with corn 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.720
 To reach a temperature close to 400 degrees as much as a pizza bowl

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:16.750
 There is family which does not use grilled fish, but it is wasteful not to use 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:24.159
 To take advantage by another one of that Higuchi that gas stove is at the time of the full of pot all

 The merit of fish grill is that it is extra hot for childcare by becoming high temperature over 300 degrees in 1 minute 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.840
 A fat will be the resin to fall below 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.840
