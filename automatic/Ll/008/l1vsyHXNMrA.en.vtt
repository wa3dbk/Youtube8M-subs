00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is and Batista probably my favorite

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
is and Batista probably my favorite
wrestler<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.560> time<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:35.040> honestly<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.869> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
wrestler of all time now honestly I you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.020 
wrestler of all time now honestly I you
know<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> might<00:01:37.530> say<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:37.770> why<00:01:38.310> Batista<00:01:38.909> was

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
know you might say well why Batista was

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
know you might say well why Batista was
supposed<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> teesta<00:01:40.259> but

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
supposed to go with the teesta but

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
supposed to go with the teesta but
honestly<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:40.890> he<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> first

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
honestly I think he was one of the first

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
honestly I think he was one of the first
wrestlers<00:01:43.049> ever<00:01:43.229> watched<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.220> started

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.180 
viewed at the end of our evolution as
well<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.640> evolution<00:02:35.920> honestly<00:02:36.920> one<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.100> the

well so evolution honestly one of the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.190 
well so evolution honestly one of the
best<00:02:37.280> stables<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.120> time<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.750> don't

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
best stables of all time and I don't

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.360 
best stables of all time and I don't
think<00:02:39.290> they'll<00:02:39.470> get<00:02:39.590> inducted<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.190> whole

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
think they'll get inducted the whole

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.699 
think they'll get inducted the whole
families<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.910> stable<00:02:41.270> no<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.630> doubt<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.410> but

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
families of stable no I doubt that but

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.420 
families of stable no I doubt that but
really<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.090> favorites<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:46.160> fact

really one of my favorites and the fact

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.949 
really one of my favorites and the fact
that<00:02:46.490> they<00:02:46.580> achieved<00:02:47.030> two<00:02:47.270> main<00:02:47.510> vent<00:02:47.750> guys

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
that they achieved two main vent guys
