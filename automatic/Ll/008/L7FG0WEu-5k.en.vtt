00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.830 

today<00:00:06.859> I'm<00:00:07.250> going<00:00:07.550> to<00:00:07.850> demonstrate<00:00:08.120> how<00:00:08.809> to

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
today I'm going to demonstrate how to

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.300 
today I'm going to demonstrate how to
add<00:00:09.080> a

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.310 
add a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.910 
add a
laser<00:00:10.670> rangefinder<00:00:11.450> on<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:12.200> your<00:00:12.380> fifty

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
laser rangefinder on to your fifty

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.490 
laser rangefinder on to your fifty
dollar<00:00:13.100> robot<00:00:13.610> first<00:00:14.570> thing<00:00:14.810> you<00:00:14.930> do<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.110> take

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
dollar robot first thing you do is take

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.300 
dollar robot first thing you do is take
your<00:00:15.680> servo<00:00:16.570> this<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:17.780> non<00:00:18.110> modified<00:00:18.800> servo

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
your servo this is a non modified servo

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.500 
your servo this is a non modified servo
and<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:20.060> rotate<00:00:20.540> it<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:21.830> both<00:00:22.100> ends<00:00:22.550> until<00:00:22.760> you

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
and you rotate it to both ends until you

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.900 
and you rotate it to both ends until you
locate<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.560> center<00:00:24.830> of<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.190> servo<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:25.730> make

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
locate the center of the servo so make

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.210 
locate the center of the servo so make
sure<00:00:25.940> that<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.509> servo<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.140> centered<00:00:27.529> along

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
sure that the servo is centered along

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.200 
sure that the servo is centered along
this<00:00:28.640> axis<00:00:28.700> here<00:00:29.599> then<00:00:30.320> what<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.130> do<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.520> you

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
this axis here then what you do is you

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.860 
this axis here then what you do is you
have<00:00:32.240> a<00:00:32.419> piece<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:32.960> velcro<00:00:33.460> I'm<00:00:34.630> going<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.720> do

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
have a piece of velcro I'm going to do

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.650 
have a piece of velcro I'm going to do
this<00:00:35.990> in<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.320> very<00:00:36.350> get<00:00:37.010> away<00:00:37.570> normally<00:00:38.570> you

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
this in a very get away normally you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.200 
this in a very get away normally you
should<00:00:38.690> do<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.110> very<00:00:39.650> nice<00:00:39.890> metallic<00:00:40.489> mounting

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
should do a very nice metallic mounting

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.240 
should do a very nice metallic mounting
if<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.290> could<00:00:42.500> get<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:42.950> velcro<00:00:43.280> off<00:00:43.790> here

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
if I could get this velcro off here

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.740 
if I could get this velcro off here
Emily<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.310> should<00:00:46.460> do<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.610> nice<00:00:46.880> mounting<00:00:47.480> for

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
Emily you should do a nice mounting for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.520 
Emily you should do a nice mounting for
your<00:00:47.900> infrared<00:00:48.380> servo<00:00:49.660> but<00:00:50.660> today<00:00:51.110> I'm<00:00:51.350> just

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
your infrared servo but today I'm just

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.910 
your infrared servo but today I'm just
going<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.770> do<00:00:51.950> it<00:00:52.100> very<00:00:52.430> ghetto<00:00:53.290> so<00:00:54.290> I<00:00:54.320> put<00:00:54.770> on<00:00:54.890> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
going to do it very ghetto so I put on a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.720 
going to do it very ghetto so I put on a
sheet<00:00:55.310> of<00:00:55.340> Elko<00:00:55.730> there<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:57.190> then<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.220> have<00:00:58.580> my

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
sheet of Elko there and then I have my

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.130 
sheet of Elko there and then I have my
other<00:00:58.880> piece<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.240> velcro<00:00:59.600> here<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:01.900> I'm<00:01:02.900> going

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
other piece of velcro here and I'm going

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.830 
other piece of velcro here and I'm going
to<00:01:04.420> attach<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.689> on<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.580> bottom<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.729> your

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
to attach it on to the bottom of your

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.609 
to attach it on to the bottom of your
sharp<00:01:08.840> infrared<00:01:09.500> range<00:01:10.280> finder<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:12.310> then<00:01:13.310> we

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
sharp infrared range finder and then we

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.459 
sharp infrared range finder and then we
place<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:16.509> right<00:01:17.509> on<00:01:17.659> top<00:01:17.960> like<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:21.320> is

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
place it right on top like that this is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.389 
place it right on top like that this is
pretty<00:01:21.679> ghetto<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.999> now<00:01:23.179> you<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.659> F<00:01:24.590> red

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
pretty ghetto but now you have a F red

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.469 
pretty ghetto but now you have a F red
range<00:01:25.729> finder<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.299> your<00:01:27.020> servo<00:01:27.439> mounted<00:01:29.409> now

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
range finder on your servo mounted now

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.020 
range finder on your servo mounted now
you<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.539> your<00:01:32.630> fifty<00:01:33.020> dollar<00:01:33.200> robot<00:01:34.030> now

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
you have your fifty dollar robot now

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.029 
you have your fifty dollar robot now
yours<00:01:35.329> probably<00:01:35.719> does<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:36.350> look<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:36.619> this

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
yours probably does not look like this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.330 
yours probably does not look like this
it<00:01:37.219> probably<00:01:37.640> looks<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.999> lot<00:01:38.179> better<00:01:38.420> than<00:01:38.719> mine

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
it probably looks a lot better than mine

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.200 
it probably looks a lot better than mine
but<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.960> take<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.319> servo<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.899> plug<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.049> in<00:01:45.200> to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
but we take the servo we plug it in to

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.889 
but we take the servo we plug it in to
the<00:01:47.210> third<00:01:47.569> digital<00:01:48.499> output<00:01:48.979> pin<00:01:49.899> your

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
the third digital output pin your

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.080 
the third digital output pin your
microcontroller<00:01:51.799> should<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.549> quite<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:52.969> few

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
microcontroller should have quite a few

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.069 
microcontroller should have quite a few
digital<00:01:53.659> output<00:01:54.049> pins<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.569> first<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
digital output pins and so the first to

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.840 
digital output pins and so the first to
of<00:01:57.200> course<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.770> left<00:01:57.979> motor<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.429> right<00:01:58.609> motor

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
of course the left motor the right motor

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.879 
of course the left motor the right motor
and<00:01:59.179> then<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.959> third<00:02:00.139> ones<00:02:00.380> now<00:02:00.619> you're

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
and then the third ones now you're

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:07.059 
and then the third ones now you're
scanning<00:02:02.799> digital<00:02:03.799> output<00:02:05.079> now<00:02:06.079> you're<00:02:06.619> sharp

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
scanning digital output now you're sharp

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.760 
scanning digital output now you're sharp
higher<00:02:07.490> range<00:02:07.909> finder<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.539> an<00:02:08.810> analog<00:02:09.289> sensor

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
higher range finder is an analog sensor

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.170 
higher range finder is an analog sensor
and<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.480> want<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.490> plug<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.640> into<00:02:13.790> an

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and so you want to plug it into an

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.290 
and so you want to plug it into an
analog<00:02:14.690> output<00:02:15.260> right<00:02:16.250> next<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.910> photo

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
analog output right next to your photo

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.890 
analog output right next to your photo
sensor<00:02:18.129> analog<00:02:19.129> outputs<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.299> it's<00:02:20.450> plugged<00:02:20.750> in

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
sensor analog outputs so it's plugged in

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.030 
sensor analog outputs so it's plugged in
like<00:02:21.140> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
like that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.520 
like that
and<00:02:23.290> tuck<00:02:24.290> away<00:02:25.359> your<00:02:26.359> control<00:02:26.810> board<00:02:27.079> now

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
and tuck away your control board now

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.170 
and tuck away your control board now
mine's<00:02:27.769> just<00:02:28.010> really<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.909> ghetto<00:02:29.439> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
mine's just really really ghetto and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.899 
mine's just really really ghetto and
somehow<00:02:32.180> my<00:02:32.709> other<00:02:33.709> board<00:02:34.069> will<00:02:34.250> fit<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.760> is

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
somehow my other board will fit this is

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.819 
somehow my other board will fit this is
definitely<00:02:35.120> ad<00:02:35.450> hoc<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.170> figure<00:02:36.469> this<00:02:36.650> out

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
definitely ad hoc I just figure this out

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.649 
definitely ad hoc I just figure this out
as<00:02:37.069> I'm<00:02:37.700> making<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.090> video<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.480> on

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
as I'm making the video so now it's on

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.880 
as I'm making the video so now it's on
there<00:02:42.280> now<00:02:43.280> as<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.390> can<00:02:44.659> see<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.379> huge

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
there now as you can see it's a huge

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.110 
there now as you can see it's a huge
wiring<00:02:46.459> mess<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:48.109> what<00:02:48.439> I<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.859> do

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
wiring mess and so what I like to do

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.479 
wiring mess and so what I like to do
with<00:02:50.120> my<00:02:50.329> wires<00:02:50.599> all<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.049> time<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> get<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
with my wires all the time so get a

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.800 
with my wires all the time so get a
twist<00:02:52.819> tie<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.069> twist<00:02:55.069> tie<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.609> on<00:02:55.909> really

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
twist tie and twist tie it on really

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.670 
twist tie and twist tie it on really
fast<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> wires<00:02:59.750> are<00:02:59.900> out<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
fast just so the wires are out of the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.649 
fast just so the wires are out of the
way<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.189> as<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.079> was<00:03:03.230> my<00:03:03.799> robot

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
way and that as get it was my robot

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.050 
way and that as get it was my robot
basically<00:03:05.659> looks<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.500> there<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.799> have<00:03:06.859> it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
basically looks so there you have it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390 
basically looks so there you have it
you're<00:03:08.260> fifty<00:03:09.260> dollar<00:03:09.439> robot<00:03:09.829> now<00:03:10.069> has<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
you're fifty dollar robot now has a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.119 
you're fifty dollar robot now has a
scanning<00:03:11.359> sharp<00:03:11.689> I<00:03:11.840> are<00:03:12.139> on<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:14.799> ok<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:15.829> have

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
scanning sharp I are on it ok I have

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.759 
scanning sharp I are on it ok I have
just<00:03:16.579> uploaded<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.419> program<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.169> robots

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
just uploaded the program to the robots

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.309 
just uploaded the program to the robots
now<00:03:19.489> before<00:03:19.790> we<00:03:20.090> turn<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.419> on<00:03:20.540> we<00:03:21.109> need<00:03:21.139> to

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
now before we turn it on we need to

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.619 
now before we turn it on we need to
calibrate<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.370> sensor<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.269> they<00:03:23.389> calibrate

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
calibrate the sensor so they calibrate

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.199 
calibrate the sensor so they calibrate
it<00:03:23.989> we<00:03:24.349> need<00:03:24.560> an<00:03:24.889> object<00:03:25.310> like<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.519> candy<00:03:26.030> box

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
it we need an object like this candy box

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.199 
it we need an object like this candy box
here<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.409> you<00:03:27.470> put<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.859> object<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.519> front

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
here and so you put the object in front

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.000 
here and so you put the object in front
of<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.389> sensor<00:03:29.659> in<00:03:30.079> front<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.440> robot<00:03:30.590> so

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
of the sensor in front of the robot so

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.309 
of the sensor in front of the robot so
you<00:03:31.069> can<00:03:31.190> see<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.479> sensor<00:03:32.870> now<00:03:33.049> sees

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
you can see and so the sensor now sees

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.890 
you can see and so the sensor now sees
the<00:03:33.590> object<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.639> calibration<00:03:35.359> was<00:03:35.510> doing

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
the object and the calibration was doing

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.830 
the object and the calibration was doing
is<00:03:36.049> measuring<00:03:36.349> that<00:03:36.739> distance<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.400> saying

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
is measuring that distance and saying

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
is measuring that distance and saying
anything<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.019> between<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.799> distance<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
anything in between this distance the

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.059 
anything in between this distance the
robot<00:03:40.879> will<00:03:41.000> chase<00:03:41.299> if<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.199> behind<00:03:42.769> that

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
robot will chase if it's behind that

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.399 
robot will chase if it's behind that
object<00:03:43.579> if<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:43.940> further<00:03:44.209> behind<00:03:44.479> then<00:03:45.290> it

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
object if it's further behind then it

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.289 
object if it's further behind then it
will<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.620> ignore<00:03:45.889> that<00:03:46.129> object<00:03:46.729> completely

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
will just ignore that object completely

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.619 
will just ignore that object completely
so<00:03:47.870> we<00:03:48.139> have<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.739> object<00:03:49.069> in<00:03:49.190> front<00:03:49.449> sensor<00:03:50.449> is

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
so we have the object in front sensor is

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.140 
so we have the object in front sensor is
pointing<00:03:50.930> at<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.169> object<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.739> now<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.940> turn

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
pointing at the object and now we turn

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.240 
pointing at the object and now we turn
it<00:03:53.329> on<00:03:53.449> so<00:03:54.169> as<00:03:54.260> soon<00:03:54.409> as<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.620> turn<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:54.979> it<00:03:55.129> on

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
it on so as soon as you turn this it on

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.879 
it on so as soon as you turn this it on
it<00:03:55.579> calibrates<00:03:56.180> then<00:03:56.959> there's<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.229> two-second

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
it calibrates then there's a two-second

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.229 
it calibrates then there's a two-second
delay<00:03:58.629> and<00:03:59.629> then<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.109> works<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.760> now<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:01.970> can

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
delay and then it works so now you can

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.590 
delay and then it works so now you can
see<00:04:02.449> the<00:04:02.569> sensor

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.470 

and<00:04:06.050> it's<00:04:06.680> sort<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.100> sees<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> object<00:04:07.520> their

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
and it's sort of sees the object their

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.620 
and it's sort of sees the object their
egos<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.960> don't<00:04:09.170> know<00:04:09.290> if<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.500> can<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.630> the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
egos I don't know if you can see it the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.390 
egos I don't know if you can see it the
CZ<00:04:11.900> object<00:04:12.320> in<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.560> wheels<00:04:12.740> are<00:04:12.950> changing

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
CZ object in the wheels are changing

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.760 
CZ object in the wheels are changing
directions<00:04:13.610> as<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.210> moves<00:04:14.390> now<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.230> better<00:04:15.500> see

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
directions as it moves now to better see

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.830 
directions as it moves now to better see
it<00:04:15.860> I'm<00:04:16.040> going<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.340> run<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.300> on<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.450> floor

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
it I'm going to run it on the floor

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.930 
it I'm going to run it on the floor
alright<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.050> we<00:04:21.110> have<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.410> robot<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:22.490> have<00:04:22.670> the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
alright so we have the robot we have the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.030 
alright so we have the robot we have the
calibration<00:04:23.570> object<00:04:23.930> sensor<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.530> pointing<00:04:24.890> at

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
calibration object sensor is pointing at

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.850 
calibration object sensor is pointing at
the<00:04:25.580> calibration<00:04:26.120> object<00:04:26.480> so<00:04:27.200> then<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:27.680> turn

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
the calibration object so then we turn

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.210 
the calibration object so then we turn
it<00:04:27.980> on<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.880> calibrates<00:04:29.510> delays<00:04:30.260> two<00:04:30.680> seconds

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
it on the calibrates delays two seconds

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.610 
it on the calibrates delays two seconds
and<00:04:31.610> then<00:04:32.360> it'll<00:04:33.080> follow<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.070> object<00:04:35.260> as<00:04:36.260> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
and then it'll follow the object as you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.980 
and then it'll follow the object as you
can<00:04:36.770> see<00:04:41.140> air<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.150> will<00:04:44.270> spin<00:04:44.480> around<00:04:44.510> if

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
can see air and it will spin around if

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.570 
can see air and it will spin around if
it<00:04:45.110> doesn't<00:04:45.470> see<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.770> object<00:04:48.340> all<00:04:49.340> right

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
it doesn't see the object all right

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.460 
it doesn't see the object all right
there<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.730> goes<00:04:53.860> now<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.100> have<00:04:55.310> your<00:04:56.470> robot

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
there it goes now you have your robot

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.310 
there it goes now you have your robot
chasing<00:04:58.040> stuff

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.520 

now<00:05:06.130> we<00:05:06.190> have<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.520> robot<00:05:06.700> set<00:05:07.060> up<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:08.140> sensor

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
now we have the robot set up the sensor

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.110 
now we have the robot set up the sensor
is

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
is

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.969 
is
the<00:05:09.270> object<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.410> first<00:05:10.650> thing<00:05:10.770> that

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
the object so the first thing that

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.460 
the object so the first thing that
happens<00:05:11.370> when<00:05:11.669> we<00:05:11.760> turn<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.060> on<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.810> calibrates

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
happens when we turn it on it calibrates

it<00:05:14.240> takes<00:05:15.350> two<00:05:16.350> seconds<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.979> calibrate<00:05:17.520> and

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
it takes two seconds to calibrate and
