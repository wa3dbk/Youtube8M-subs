00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.430
 paulo bernardo 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.449
 Bruna Calmon 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.000
 How cool about others to keep talking 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 one of the suspects 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.779
 digital media in brazil 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.779
 the scottish 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.349
 table and lightness 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.169
 since that date of the session 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.599
 I do not know if it was a lie 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.779
 the intention to stay in Brazil 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 It's to arrive at Bethlehem. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.560
 Congratulations to Mr. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 Actually there 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.920
 I can not say that my agency a moratorium 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 or be interactive some of this I think it's cool to conquer the market 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 burke forgets are his back to clarice his pop rock pop with the album 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 has installed power 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.910
 have already dismissed 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.580
 lack of knowledge 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.970
 yeltsin popular in the united states 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 she would have said she was not yet 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 the market is much more expensive 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 the price for the consumer but also the price 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.080
 implementation. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.180
 it's complicated 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.240
 benefits 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.770
 is much better in terms of quality in terms of sound 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.619
 peculiar cultural heritage 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.890
 the dialogue that may or may not happen such a real plan 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.680
 this means that the more you speak very well of the consumer idec 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 but in this case it can interact in real time information 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.450
 broadly, the work of the Portuguese agency was 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.340
 but the big jump the gymnast 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.750
 8- 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.690
 She finished the game and interactivity 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.310
 and it will get bigger and unique 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.380
 antónio melo and I still intend to high-definition on Saturday the information 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 activists and in Brazil that the number of dissidents 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.990
 she is making him and his team have to change is the way to make the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.980
 acts 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.640
 it was completely her resolution 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.370
 rui sa your first moment must dictate what she will get to the blur 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.720
 until the image quality finally starts to have broadcasts 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.420
 we invest in the Olympics with certainty and demand is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.569
 very large 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.890
 I won the first thing that according to her content to digital tv I think the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.379
 as close as possible 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.879
 and all internet interaction by injury since it is 306 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.379
 hello people 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.049
 will also be more talking now 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.370
 the art of digital tv others will finish do not know 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.079
 yes I know more 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.049
 1 the tie 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.209
 I do not know which foot 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 I'm just working within this context. 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.519
 Do you have any questions? 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.800
 thanks I think the lateral interactivity a very rich thing 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.099
 in the world of brands because I'm talking 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.879
 for the Martinista urbanist to interact with the brand means that they will enter the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.489
 world of the brand in the market 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.810
 and is intrigued 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.339
 another important pecnik aspect 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.009
 while these operations had strapped the exams in the middle of a 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.829
 program or trade interval 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.109
 the digital tv signal 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.049
 he needs to keep going sang so far because this signal a sign of 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.269
 radio broadcasting in Brazil and other countries, also broadcasting is a service 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.809
 public and free 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.199
 that need to be financed with the media 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.769
 Advertisers then pay for commercial breaks on a signal and tried the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.009
 all the time available on the screen - when you have a moment in the interactivity that is 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.219
 what 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.019
 we want to be the forecast will remain fair even if we do not have the 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.879
 interactivity and no further say that there is something new trend 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.879
 in the future perhaps because television has now 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.299
 the digital globe 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.869
 the viewer 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.039
 interactive screen giroud 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:57.039
 and the propaganda needs to fall into the real needs to deal with this new reality is 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.259
 true that is donor 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.259
 and began to be again on the case 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.379
 paint more deceive the hunger with the average capital 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.379
 there is also the readiness of the independent and tarauacá 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.359
 guatemala perneta city 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.619
 champions also reported that many of us were 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:16.620
 that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.250
 one in more and more in the interactive that I'm sure are already by 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.570
 everyone on the internet all have their new york gadgets 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.120
 join interacting with support as well 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.940
 big hug iniesta iniesta until the next program
