00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 he is back there again 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.240
 third time or comes 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 note october in the cinema 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 after the book has been published in 2012 and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.400
 is actually everywhere to see because I 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.530
 my 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 this striking haircut with the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 Small lettering was not too 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.510
 overlook that everywhere for the first time 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.160
 I personally always have perceived 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
 thought again so bring the book but there 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.340
 I said shit somehow even 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 no more adolf hitler because i 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 have me with history then but one 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 We were busy and then had little 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.420
 interest in this book now but 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 original for me truth of the joke 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 from the week or so I have mine 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.890
 at order pictures the audiobook 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.899
 loaded because I had too much credit 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 and thought I'll fuck you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.700
 it is apparently very well known 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.730
 Were popular all the way to place one 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.840
 definitely several months and yes I have to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 say i enjoyed it when was 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.570
 read by christoph maria herbst and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 he really has what I think 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 that was fantastic 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
 a lot of fun listening to him because 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 if I imagine I have myself 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 I read this book by far 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 not consistently this voice in the head 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 because he reads that means 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 actually as if it still would 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 adolf hitler in thoughts with his 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 I speak and I doubt I doubt 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 I would have perceived that myself 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.650
 while reading and accordingly has me 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 that very much liked now as 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 Effective and hardly I was with it 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.159
 finished original one day later 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.259
 this announcement reaches me this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.880
 book and the book is filmed me 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.590
 think so great I'm so happy 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 on it even if now many said 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.250
 actually the book or also 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.650
 the audiobook was really at the beginning 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 really great and too so from the middle to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.619
 then the end will be so-so 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.409
 Everyone has their own views 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.790
 in two short teasers see like adolf 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.890
 Hitler is like the internet 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.540
 and actually there 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.619
 are but when is weird because 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 I do not remember 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.560
 one can not imagine it just as 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 he with the problem of the new time on this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.729
 makes in and of itself first book 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.820
 the idea is also very well done so very much 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.380
 ingeniously designed here expects 66 years 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 after his supposed goal again 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 and it can not work anymore 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 understands the world no longer do not know 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.659
 Why he is here in the middle of Berlin 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.640
 on in my hometown and understand 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.590
 just not trying anymore 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.579
 somehow make a way 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.810
 Find out what's happening 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.200
 after his friends goebbels and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.069
 Bormann has to search once 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.469
 he observes 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.420
 all alone and there I him 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.780
 of course already dead take it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.609
 how people will not compete anymore 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 really real copy and are totally 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.049
 convinced that is again so 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.120
 africa comedien is simply some 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.670
 some are not funny again 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.170
 opinions apart one just keeps 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 for christoph maria herbst or the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.659
 to become another christoph maria autumn 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.180
 thinks rich in ride just wonderful 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.219
 i'm curious how 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.959
 then you want to film the whole book 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.719
 the whole thing is represented by it 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.549
 that if you listen to it as an audiobook 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.949
 like me then I noticed that there 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.169
 many of his thoughts are quasi 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.030
 no one was playing time 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.019
 his head laughs more than there 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.489
 was spoken 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.409
 Accordingly, I am very curious 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.269
 how they will realize that 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.370
 I have a short youtube for that 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.480
 Detail found by the Westphalian 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.280
 Parliament 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.430
 they have the whole as a stage program 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.139
 had as and then longer monologue 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.329
 then found in his head instead 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.669
 sat work your uniform falls 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.879
 and behind him , it was like that 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.470
 doppelgÃ¤nger his thoughts and has 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.810
 then almost what he was talking 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.310
 thought so i finally found the idea 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.629
 that's good for the theater 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.439
 Of course they have much more 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.120
 leeway 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.379
 such a film must be more with that 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.970
 Convince the act and 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.409
 Accordingly, I am very curious 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.599
 but I'm pretty sure I will 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.739
 I watch this movie because it has me 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 audiobook I like it so much 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.030
 same day later this comes 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.530
 Announcement is the hammer so on 18 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.299
 do not forget october 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.949
 then here in german cinemas one 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.750
 I have to say I find myself 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.459
 the trailers do not look like that now 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.409
 Well , rail would not have that for me now 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.209
 convinced I'm glad that I just 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.739
 this novel cellar as audiobook 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.569
 and accordingly, I say to everyone 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.489
 case it is to me, please tell me 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.500
 I ask my question to you quasi 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.900
 now you have read the books 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.579
 Based on that, you would say 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.739
 or not or respectively 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.969
 convince you the trailer the action 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.769
 in the video description again 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.539
 linked there you can both look at each other 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.280
 it happens to me very much would you say 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.379
 okay if you see the basement so well 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.930
 could be worth it or are you there 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.969
 rather not because it is natural 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 again peppered with a lot of black humor 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.500
 With 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.270
 Must be with exaggerated kind of sarcasm 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.410
 you then so again not quite 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.510
 understand because everyone around him 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.400
 of course he thinks his actors 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.169
 and do not really understand that there 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.960
 the real hitler is the real leader 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.750
 and actually welcome with the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.210
 Old German Russian and do not realize 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.340
 like everyone's own for him 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.540
 I just find this perception 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.070
 history is awesome 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.169
 the idea behind it is so great 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.820
 I like it accordingly 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.770
 will be in the cinema in october 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.750
 to let me know you are there too are 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.699
 you are not there how do you like it 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.889
 trailer writes me the comments 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.340
 We'll see you next video 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.340
 See you
