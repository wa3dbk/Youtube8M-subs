00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.400 
since ti1 so now with the game released
and<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.310> on<00:00:48.430> I<00:00:48.460> think<00:00:48.610> it's<00:00:48.910> going<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.290> expand<00:00:50.290> a

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410

and so on I think it's going to expand a
lot<00:00:50.560> more<00:00:50.790> question<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:51.910> if<00:00:52.000> it's<00:00:52.150> going<00:00:52.270> to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
lot more question is if it's going to

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.030

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
certain amount of time before you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.630 
certain amount of time before you
actually<00:03:31.030> can<00:03:31.359> do<00:03:31.480> something<00:03:32.250> or<00:03:33.250> do<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> lot

actually can do something or do a lot

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.789 
actually can do something or do a lot
and<00:03:33.850> that's<00:03:34.630> kind<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:34.959> an<00:03:35.109> issue<00:03:35.230> against<00:03:35.680> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
and that's kind of an issue against that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.069 
and that's kind of an issue against that
but<00:03:36.010> if<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.549> these<00:03:36.760> am<00:03:37.299> stress<00:03:37.750> where

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
but if you have these am stress where

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.380 
but if you have these am stress where
they<00:03:38.590> protect<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.609> would<00:03:40.209> say

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
they protect and so on I would say

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.849 
they protect and so on I would say
that's<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.720> possibility<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.410> play<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.739> hero

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
that's a possibility to play the hero

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.800 
that's a possibility to play the hero
but<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.760> hard<00:03:42.850> hero<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.239> pull<00:03:43.510> off<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.750> a

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
but it's a hard hero to pull off in a

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.170 
but it's a hard hero to pull off in a
competitive<00:03:44.079> scene<00:03:44.470> but<00:03:45.250> for<00:03:45.640> playing<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.150> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
competitive scene but for playing it I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.970 
competitive scene but for playing it I
don't<00:03:46.570> know<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.660> don't<00:03:46.840> think<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.350> for<00:03:47.859> me

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
don't know I don't think like for me

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.599 
don't know I don't think like for me
it's<00:03:48.130> it's<00:03:49.000> not<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> hard<00:03:49.570> like<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.400> playing<00:03:51.400> it

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
it's it's not a hard like now playing it

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.330 
it's it's not a hard like now playing it
until<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.510> get<00:03:52.600> level<00:03:52.870> 5<00:03:53.019> with<00:03:53.200> Agra<00:03:53.440> you

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
more options but before that it's it's

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.080 
more options but before that it's it's
very<00:03:59.049> doable<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.560> practice<00:03:59.950> okay<00:04:00.730> well<00:04:00.940> thank
