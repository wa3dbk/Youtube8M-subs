look at the Nike Vapor flex driver so
this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.450> that<00:00:21.540> Tigers<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.290> some

important it so we have a look at the
head<00:00:25.650> there<00:00:25.919> we<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.450> little

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
head there we can see there's a little

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.790 
head there we can see there's a little
hot<00:00:28.169> sat<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> back<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:30.380> gonna<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
hot sat in the back I'm gonna do a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
hot sat in the back I'm gonna do a
little<00:00:32.250> clip<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.820> talking<00:00:33.149> through<00:00:33.300> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
little clip just talking through that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.590 
little clip just talking through that
now<00:00:35.090> okay<00:00:36.090> guys<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> Flex

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
now okay guys so we can see the Flex

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
now okay guys so we can see the Flex
vapor<00:00:39.600> flex<00:00:39.930> head<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.769> and<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.609> see<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
vapor flex head here and we can see the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
vapor flex head here and we can see the
flight<00:00:42.899> pod<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:44.190> actually<00:00:44.519> just<00:00:44.550> swaps<00:00:44.940> into

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
flight pod this actually just swaps into

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
flight pod this actually just swaps into
the<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> driver<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> depending<00:00:47.789> on

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the back of the driver and depending on

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
the back of the driver and depending on
where<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.390> put<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.170> weight<00:00:49.350> either<00:00:49.829> front<00:00:50.280> or

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
where you put the weight either front or

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.419 
where you put the weight either front or
back<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> alter<00:00:52.230> launch<00:00:52.739> angle<00:00:53.250> by

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
back it's going to alter launch angle by

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.299 
back it's going to alter launch angle by
up<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.030> degree<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:55.410> spin<00:00:55.679> rate<00:00:55.949> by

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
up to a degree and the spin rate by

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.150 
up to a degree and the spin rate by
about<00:00:56.629> 300<00:00:57.629> revs<00:00:57.870> per<00:00:58.109> minute<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:59.039> we're

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
about 300 revs per minute but we're

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
about 300 revs per minute but we're
gonna<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> set<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.789> hit<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.570> shots<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
gonna get it set up hit some shots is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.919 
gonna get it set up hit some shots is
here<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.589> performs<00:01:02.359> okay<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:03.690> said

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
here at performs okay so I've said

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.490 
here at performs okay so I've said
Tigers<00:01:04.530> had<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.830> input<00:01:04.980> into<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
Tigers had some input into this and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
Tigers had some input into this and
surely<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.650> 2015<00:01:08.310> hopefully<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> gonna

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
surely for 2015 hopefully this is gonna

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.620 
surely for 2015 hopefully this is gonna
be<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.660> Tigers<00:01:10.080> bag<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> slightly<00:01:12.330> smaller

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
be in Tigers bag so slightly smaller

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.070 
be in Tigers bag so slightly smaller
head<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.680> throw<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> yeah<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> one

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
head than the throw so yeah this one

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
head than the throw so yeah this one
looks<00:01:16.110> great<00:01:16.650> behind<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> ball<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.480> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
looks great behind the ball and you can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000 
looks great behind the ball and you can
definitely<00:01:18.930> tell<00:01:19.050> us<00:01:19.230> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.440> bit<00:01:19.620> smaller

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
definitely tell us a little bit smaller

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:32.530 
definitely tell us a little bit smaller
but<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.820> nice<00:01:21.060> shape<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.480> will<00:01:24.660> be<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.520 

very<00:01:33.540> flat<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.510> with<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.200> I've

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
very flat and I have with this one I've

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.320 
very flat and I have with this one I've
done<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.310> lofty<00:01:38.730> than<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
done a little bit more lofty than it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.640 
done a little bit more lofty than it
would<00:01:39.450> normally<00:01:39.480> be<00:01:39.870> I've<00:01:40.080> gone<00:01:40.230> ten<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.620> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
would normally be I've gone ten and a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.400 
would normally be I've gone ten and a
half<00:01:40.830> bar<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.850> she<00:01:42.060> got<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.510> set<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.870> spin<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
half bar but she got it set to spin a

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.520 
half bar but she got it set to spin a
little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.740> less<00:01:44.010> that<00:01:47.210> was<00:01:48.210> great<00:01:48.530> really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
little bit less that was great really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.840 
little bit less that was great really
really<00:01:49.830> low<00:01:50.310> spin<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.660> that's<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.230> more

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
really low spin so that's it for more

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.720 
really low spin so that's it for more
numbers

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730

probably<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.729> pro<00:02:11.390> driver<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.570> one's

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
probably the pro driver but this one's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.370 
probably the pro driver but this one's
so<00:02:18.020> far<00:02:18.380> those<00:02:18.800> first<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.460> was<00:02:19.550> performed

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so far those first it was performed

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:34.210 
so far those first it was performed

sounds<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> bit<00:03:40.620> different<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.450> pro

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
sounds a bit different to the the pro

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.380 
sounds a bit different to the the pro
but<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.960> really<00:03:43.530> like<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.830> sound<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.430> it's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
but I really like that sound and it's

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
but I really like that sound and it's
like<00:03:45.510> uh<00:03:45.600> some<00:03:45.750> numbers<00:03:46.080> because<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.500> me

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
like uh some numbers because for me

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.880 
like uh some numbers because for me
so<00:03:47.760> far<00:03:48.060> I've<00:03:48.240> tested<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> Flex<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.380> Pro<00:03:49.620> and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
so far I've tested the Flex the Pro and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.490 
so far I've tested the Flex the Pro and
the<00:03:50.010> speed<00:03:50.480> probably<00:03:51.480> looks<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.050> feel<00:03:52.230> wise

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
the speed probably looks and feel wise

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.890 
the speed probably looks and feel wise
is<00:03:52.860> probably<00:03:53.459> winning<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.910> me<00:03:53.940> some<00:03:54.630> look<00:03:54.780> for

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
is probably winning for me some look for

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.670 
is probably winning for me some look for
some<00:03:55.020> numbers<00:03:55.350> stereo<00:03:56.040> performance<00:03:57.680> okay

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
some numbers stereo performance okay

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.070 
some numbers stereo performance okay
guys<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.520> flight<00:03:59.760> scope<00:04:00.090> vapor

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
guys so we can see on flight scope vapor

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.550 
guys so we can see on flight scope vapor

for me the really pleasing thing there
was<00:04:15.750> nice<00:04:16.290> low<00:04:16.590> spin<00:04:17.010> at<00:04:17.480> 2400<00:04:18.590> launch<00:04:19.590> angle

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
was nice low spin at 2400 launch angle

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.590 
was nice low spin at 2400 launch angle
maybe<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.340> low<00:04:20.579> at<00:04:20.700> nine<00:04:20.880> point<00:04:21.239> four

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
maybe a little low at nine point four

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.940 
maybe a little low at nine point four
but<00:04:22.260> obviously<00:04:22.590> you've<00:04:22.710> got<00:04:22.740> the

good total distance for me now slow spin

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.450 
good total distance for me now slow spin
which<00:04:52.110> was<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.620> know<00:04:52.680> really<00:04:53.040> good<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.370> me

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
mean I've got that set ten and a half I

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.860 
mean I've got that set ten and a half I
think<00:05:09.960> looking<00:05:10.320> at<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.740> numbers<00:05:11.330> my<00:05:12.330> even<00:05:12.780> be

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
think looking at the numbers my even be

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.690 
think looking at the numbers my even be
tempted<00:05:13.260> just<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.560> crank<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:13.979> up<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.280> eleven

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
tempted just to crank that up to eleven

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.360 
tempted just to crank that up to eleven
and<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.880> half<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.360> keeping<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.840> low<00:05:15.960> spin<00:05:16.370> but
