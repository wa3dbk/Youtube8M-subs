and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:10.830> infinitely<00:02:11.959> complex<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and then infinitely complex you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
and then infinitely complex you
can<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.520> want<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.300> road

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
but for me it's just about really

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.860 
but for me it's just about really
getting<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> endocrine<00:02:19.410> glands<00:02:19.710> clean

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
getting the endocrine glands clean

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.450 
getting the endocrine glands clean
