00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 greet you now i will tell you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.360
 history of the famous project of all 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.379
 fish 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.220
 chapter 1 nsk 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:23.510
 admin with a smart nickname in the far 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.920
 2006 along with a man named 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 Oleg sost founded server Vova and Nice to 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.940
 the project developed rapidly and began 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.200
 generate income part of which 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 fell but he him and he realized that 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:48.510
 can make more money by opening 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.910
 your project so appeared in the fish but 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 on clever knew that he could not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 compete 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.250
 son of risk and having access to databases deleted 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.609
 their it was very mean given the fact that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 nsk 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.810
 was at the time one of the top 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 pirated servers vovka rcml typed 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 online and because noun owned it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 because material received during 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.470
 work on nsk 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 chapter 2 cataclysm 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:33.299
 in 2011, there was a server in Magick Islands 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.500
 future chief rival Islands pickaxe 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.890
 on in magiks became the first Russian 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 cataclysm server that threw back 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 rpl in the background but development over 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.530
 the core of the cataclysm is just beginning and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:57.479
 therefore, the regiment could not operatively 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:02.850
 go to the cataclysm and then they bought 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:07.840
 ready core giving it off as its who played 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:14.170
 at that time remember how awful you are 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 implementation chapter 3 through 4 3 4 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 many wondered why in Kirk 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.980
 so lagged behind the magic in terms of transition 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.069
 the next patch thing is that the core 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 bought in actor Kolomna supported 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.290
 This transition and she began to work 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.640
 over his core but he had no special 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.700
 skills in this business therefore work is very 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.620
 strongly delayed and he spent on them 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.910
 big money to hire people in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.260
 in the end, the core was ready to lag 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:05.780
 Geeks injury was half a year 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.720
 chapter 4 the future of the project is not beyond 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 the mountains of pirate about andree as 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.930
 famous in magik already started work on 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.430
 the core 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.989
 Islands Kirk still lie in the development process 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.569
 cataclysm 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.180
 therefore, we can assume that the plan of the ancient 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.370
 wacker prick will appear with a huge 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.250
 late 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:36.280
 with the proviso that nouneyma again 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.280
 there is money for hiring programmers 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.239
 Monaco
