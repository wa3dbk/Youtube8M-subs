 I mean not sharing likes and other things 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.100
 nonsense is a custom advertising publication 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 that is, it is an advertising thing 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.500

 choose to see 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:54.880
 choosing a community of choice will not give no 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.940
 give why because from 12 to 18 asks 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.940

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 application 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.710
 after you submit the application 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.170
 if the customer agrees in the tab 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.280
 to perform a task appear with the date and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 time its implementation cost if 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.490
 customer rejects your offers 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.709
 it will be placed in the tab from 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.820
 Panin but there is of course 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:49.840
 affiliate program conditions materials 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.620

 also you can act like 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.220
 advertiser you are creating a campaign and 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.500
 then pick it up under it 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.320
 in principle, the interface is very similar to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.660
 bogun who worked became a system here 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:23.130
