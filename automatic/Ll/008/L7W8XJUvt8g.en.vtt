00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.920
 day over the years I have 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.840
 really gleaned so many useful little things 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.910

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.660

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.610

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.719
 modular that I purchased in America 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.509

 purchased if you remember the world 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.110
 creative and that I will use precisely for 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.110
 crop them and to create tags 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.910
 are other decorations for the tree that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.670
 over the years it has always obtained and used 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.500
 to embellish my packages from these 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.600
 paper punches that are a lot 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.479
 useful or the big circle this one 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 little one to the hearts and then or the big one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.410
 instead to tag 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.980
 ok so then show you my 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.930
 patients 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.490
 as you can see I will use for almost everything 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.380
 the video the wrapping paper la 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.020
 very simple brown paper the attack 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.900
 because it's one of my favorites in this 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.250
 case I used this pine tape of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 red curds that I really find 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.930
 delicious although a little difficult I have to 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.460
 say they have to do in bulk though 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.130
 really cute and not paid 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.760
 euros to the shops just a whole euro then 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 I glued the one with the hot of the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.940
 then decorations these balls which 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.820
 would be the decorations for the tree of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.390
 Christmas and then a small pen 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.390
 which I find delicious 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.819
 once my package is defined or 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.870
 added the inevitable ticket 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.790
 greeting card with my message 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.939
 within personal that it takes 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.939
 always 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.510
 also for this other package always 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.330
 wrapping paper 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.460
 I decided on a collar this doily 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.270
 that in the middle the one for sweets a 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.490
 heart shape 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.480
 having finished the normal glue I have it 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.480
 glued with hot glue 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.050
 in this case he used instead of the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.340
 baker you bought me in new york 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.080
 a few years ago and I still have it 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.240
 so much to use 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.700
 I leave you in my blog anyway 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.270
 useful info for finding a jet online 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.270

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.160

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.819
 absolutely adorable 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 for this other package always paper 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.960
 from package this time decided to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.180
 use my cards and use 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.650
 the new cutting perforator that 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.930
 bought at the fair I was looking forward to 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.930
 to use and that is precisely my father 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.110
 that decided to insert the 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.259
 package inside one of mine 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.900
 jute bags but I take off the ribbon 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.699
 red that I find horrible then I insert 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.560
 to my package and I close the 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.509
 bag with my notice 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.389
 much nicer and by the way is that 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.090
 which I found with the fragrance for 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.590

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.900

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.680
 this tape 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.640
 for larger gifts or 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.620
 those that have a strange shape from 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.590

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.360
 these bags of lined paper you find 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.520
 from who bought some 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.040
 long ago and they are adorable 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.260
 but I obviously decided to add 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.540
 some more decoration using 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.650

 for this other use package 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.479
 instead of the different card with all the 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.219
 musical notes and beautiful era 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.249
