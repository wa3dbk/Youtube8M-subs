00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I'll bet you'll get an A if you build

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.220 
I'll bet you'll get an A if you build
one<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> these<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:24.330> gonna<00:00:24.570> show<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> way

one of these I'm gonna show you the way

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.870 
one of these I'm gonna show you the way
to<00:00:25.289> make<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> doesn't<00:00:26.250> look<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.550> your

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to make it so it doesn't look like your

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599 
to make it so it doesn't look like your
parents<00:00:27.300> built<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> either<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.609> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
parents built it either you know that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
parents built it either you know that
never<00:00:29.849> happens<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.740> not

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
never happens right well it's not

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
never happens right well it's not
perfect<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.579> bit<00:00:32.820> sloppy<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.300> it'll<00:00:33.690> get<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
perfect a bit sloppy but it'll get the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
perfect a bit sloppy but it'll get the
point<00:00:34.140> across<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.710> you'll<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> good<00:00:35.399> grade

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
point across and you'll get a good grade

it's<00:00:48.120> actually<00:00:48.690> called<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.170> ale<00:00:49.410> loop<00:00:49.770> I'll

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's actually called an ale loop I'll

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's actually called an ale loop I'll
jet<00:00:50.670> engine<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.180> spins<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.719> heated<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
jet engine which spins when heated you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500 
jet engine which spins when heated you
know<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.309> century<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> man<00:00:54.210> called

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
know in the first century the man called

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
know in the first century the man called
hero<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> Alexandria<00:00:56.030> described<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.180> device

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
hero of Alexandria described a device

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
hero of Alexandria described a device
thus<00:00:57.930> many<00:00:58.469> sources<00:00:58.949> say<00:00:59.129> he's<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.370> inventor

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
thus many sources say he's the inventor

he<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.200> his<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.159> more<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.520> scale<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
he was his was more to scale and had a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
he was his was more to scale and had a
Bunsen<00:01:09.540> burner<00:01:09.570> under<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> beaker<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Bunsen burner under the beaker for the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
Bunsen burner under the beaker for the
boiler<00:01:11.700> most<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.540> plastic<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> saw

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
boiler most are plastic but when I saw

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
boiler most are plastic but when I saw
this<00:01:13.920> copper<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.150> reminded<00:01:15.540> me<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.840> dad

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this copper one it reminded me of my dad

tubing<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.100> form<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.490> frame<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> show<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
tubing to form a frame as I show here I

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.960 
tubing to form a frame as I show here I
originally<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.490> build<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.880> with

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
originally was going to build it with

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
originally was going to build it with
the<00:01:48.119> boiler<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> middle<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> tube<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the boiler in the middle of the tube but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
the boiler in the middle of the tube but
since<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> found<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> too<00:01:51.210> hard<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> bend<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
since I found it too hard to bend I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.249 
since I found it too hard to bend I
abandoned<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.340> idea<00:01:53.540> also<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.899> copper

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
abandoned that idea also the copper

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
abandoned that idea also the copper
toilet<00:01:55.740> float<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.189> easily<00:01:56.610> damaged<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.600> only

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
toilet float is easily damaged the only

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.240 
toilet float is easily damaged the only
thing<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> need<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> drill<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
thing you need to do is drill out the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.530 
thing you need to do is drill out the
threads<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> side<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> brass

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
threads on the side with the brass

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
threads on the side with the brass
fitting<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> tube<00:02:01.829> spins<00:02:02.250> freely<00:02:02.549> in

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fitting so the tube spins freely in

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.819 
fitting so the tube spins freely in
there<00:02:03.030> make<00:02:03.540> sure<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.930> plug<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> copper<00:02:04.560> tube

my case I simply purchased a can of air
and<00:03:48.180> drew<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> picture<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.500> showing<00:03:49.769> the

you're gonna find a can will get very
cold<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.060> pressure<00:04:00.300> will<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.569> down<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.680> if

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
cold and the pressure will go down so if
