00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
latitudes with this solar storm hitting

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
latitudes with this solar storm hitting
us<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.739> fifteenth<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.910> lingering

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
us on the fifteenth and it is lingering

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
us on the fifteenth and it is lingering
effects<00:01:04.019> through<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> 17th<00:01:05.250> at

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
effects through the 17th at

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
effects through the 17th at
mid-latitudes<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> thirty

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
mid-latitudes it's more like a thirty

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
mid-latitudes it's more like a thirty
percent<00:01:07.799> chance<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.220> four<00:01:08.400> active<00:01:08.760> conditions

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
percent chance of four active conditions

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
percent chance of four active conditions
so<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> roar<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> possible<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:11.189> at

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so there is a roar a possible down at

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
so there is a roar a possible down at
mid-latitudes<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.659> effects<00:01:13.080> should

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
mid-latitudes but these effects should

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
mid-latitudes but these effects should
fade<00:01:13.619> over<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.580> few<00:01:14.729> days<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.659> we

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
fade over the next few days but we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770 
fade over the next few days but we
aren't<00:01:15.960> expecting<00:01:16.530> total<00:01:17.210> quiet<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> end

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
aren't expecting total quiet at the end

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
aren't expecting total quiet at the end
near<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> through<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> weekend<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.580> we

near the through the weekend because we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
near the through the weekend because we
are<00:01:21.390> expecting<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.140> weak<00:01:22.350> high<00:01:22.530> speed

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
are expecting a very weak high speed

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
are expecting a very weak high speed

few days as that region rotates out of
you<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.790> still<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.180> region<00:01:48.479> 2259<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.530> contend

you we still have region 2259 to contend

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
you we still have region 2259 to contend
with<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.880> haven't<00:01:51.210> completely<00:01:51.899> lost<00:01:52.049> our<00:01:52.439> M

with so we haven't completely lost our M
flare<00:01:52.860> risk<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> next<00:01:54.689> two<00:01:54.990> or

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

flare risk and also in the next two or
three<00:01:55.170> days<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> new<00:01:56.549> region<00:01:56.969> that's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
three days there's a new region that's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
three days there's a new region that's
been<00:01:57.299> growing<00:01:57.450> quite<00:01:57.869> rapidly<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.590> the

backside that will be rotating into view

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
backside that will be rotating into view
so<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> wouldn't<00:02:01.619> surprise<00:02:01.740> me<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.280> noah

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so it wouldn't surprise me if noah

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.480 
so it wouldn't surprise me if noah

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
beginning of the week we don't however

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.889 
beginning of the week we don't however
seem<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.940> chance<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.599> a

so<00:02:12.290> Noah<00:02:12.560> has<00:02:12.800> keep<00:02:13.070> kept<00:02:13.520> its<00:02:13.730> levels<00:02:14.360> at

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
so Noah has keep kept its levels at

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.540 
so Noah has keep kept its levels at
normal<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.440> look<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.890> Burrell<00:02:16.100> all<00:02:16.370> in

the clear so the next few days look like

the clear so the next few days look like
